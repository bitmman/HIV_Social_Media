1xmznc,Question about PrEP and HIV transmission,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1xmznc/question_about_prep_and_hiv_transmission/,[deleted],5,2/11/2014 11:38,18,/r/askgaybros/comments/1xmznc/question_about_prep_and_hiv_transmission/,NaN,"Hi all:

My roomate went on PrEP about 3 months ago and has essentially been a cum dump since.  Every day he has at least one guy coming over to breed him... Sometimes several.   I don't care that he's going through a phase but he and I are friends and I do want him to not face permanent damage.

He said that because he's on PrEP he CANT get HIV or GIVE HIV to someone.  My concern is the that the second or third guy In a day is coming into a pretty toxic hole at that point as lets face it if he's getting guys who are into the BB scene there will be some poz guys In that mix.   So, can a neg top guy get HIV from having sex with someone bottoming who is carrying a toxic load in them? And how accurate is he when he says he CAN'T get HIV?  As a side note In the last month he has tested positive for just about everything else but HIV.

Edit: wow, thanks everyone , you have given me a lot of ammunition for a heart to heart later today.  I really appreciate it everyone!"

28utgx,Should I start taking Truvada (PrEP)?,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/28utgx/should_i_start_taking_truvada_prep/,cassandraspeaks,1,6/23/2014 0:37,13,/r/askgaybros/comments/28utgx/should_i_start_taking_truvada_prep/,NaN,"So I've been debating whether or not I should start taking Truvada (PrEP) - I recognize that it's a huge step forward for HIV prevention, but I'm also not sure if it's the right thing for me to be doing in my own unique circumstance.  I'm currently an unemployed (although possibly to likely employed in the near future) early-20s gay man who has sex - (almost) always safe - on a relatively regular basis (once or twice a month), usually with new or non-exclusive partners.  Anyway, my three major concerns, in no particular order, are:

1. Truvada is ~$1200 a year before insurance.  I'm on my parents' insurance (which will cover it) until I'm 26, at which point I'll have to get my own insurance through work (which might not cover it, depending on the job, or if I have one...) or individually (which might be pretty tight on my budget), or I'd have to continue buying it out of pocket (ditto).

2. Two members of my immediate family have genetic conditions that indirectly affect kidney function, and theoretically might cause them to require a kidney transplant in the future, and I am a potential match for both, as well as the only one in my immediate family.  They are not *likely* to ever require a transplant, and the issues are minor and unlikely to ever require management more aggressive than mild dietary restrictions, but it is within the theoretical realm of possibility.  Taking anti-retroviral drugs causes one to be considered a poor candidate to be a kidney donor (because they damage the kidneys).

3. Truvada has a lot of pretty unpleasant side effects for something that only offers marginally greater protection against HIV than simply using condoms, which I do already (although, on the other hand, I *have* slipped up a couple of times).  I'm also not all that great at remembering to take medication every day - although I will say that I've never been prescribed anything I *need* to take every day, so it's possible I'd be more conscientious with Truvada.

Of these, I think #2 is the strongest argument against my taking it, although I wonder if I'm just being a hypochondriac by proxy and/or if it's just a poor excuse to rationalize not doing the smart thing.  On the other hand, if it ever did come to someone in my family needing a kidney donation and they died or suffered because I wasn't able to be the donor, it would be very hard for me to forgive myself.

Am I being nuts here, or smart?"

After fucking for a bit he asked if he could take it off once again reassuring me he was on PrEP an -. I said yes and he continued. He came in me twice and I came in him once. I was fine with it afterwards but then got the though in my head, what if he was not telling the truth and just really wanted to bareback? 

I know the chances of him being + while on PrEP are super slim and then passing it one are even slimmer but I am just worried. its my first time ever not using condoms and I'm a bit freaked.

Before finding this out I've not considered taking PrEP because of the $1800 cost of medication without insurance. I'm not overly sexually active, but HIV prevention seems wise, especially for living in such a high risk area. From what I understand, PrEP eliminates the enzyme that HIV uses to replicate, but I have two concerns. 1) I'm curious what else my body uses this specific enzyme for and how it will impact my body without this enzyme. 2) I'm quite concerned that PrEP makes you undetectable rather than resistant. 

I have an appointment this coming Saturday to speak with a nurse about getting a prescription, but I would also like to hear what people's thoughts, opinions, and insights are from within our community.

Others say there are other STIs to worry about. True enough, but that was true before HIV, is true for majority of straight people who don't always use condoms, etc. And there are STIs even if you wear condoms. 

I'm on PrEP but still wear a condom. For me, it's about back-up. I've had condoms break several times. I'm also more relaxed during oral sex now. It's great.

i wish this was more common; like birth control. and obviously my parents dont know the first thing about PrEP. But i do have very good health insurance; and i am open so getting my parents approval wouldnt be a big issue.

all these websites show having to apply; or submit some kind of documentation for why i need it. But isnt it enough being a 20 year old MSM; thats pretty much the highest risk category right?. 
would i have luck just discussing this with my family doctor?
or do i need to hunt out a PrEP clinic that will help me


im sorry if this information is easily available somewhere; and im sorry if its asked a TON; but it is a very confusing topic full of outdated information already.

this is the part that concerns me

Meet one of the following risk factors: 
Have a partner or partners known to be HIV-1 infected

OR 

Be a gay/bisexual/other man, or transgender person, who has sex with men in a high HIV prevalence area or social network and has one or more of the following conditions:

A diagnosis of a bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the last year
Exposure to an STI through a sexual network in the last year
Ten or more sexual partners in the last year
Used methamphetamine in the last year
Had unprotected anal intercourse with a partner of unknown HIV-1 status with any of the factors listed above.

i dont really meet any of those categories; i guess no harm in lying about the 10 sexual partners; i assume with grindr i will hit that soon

In the past year, I've been with roughly 3-5 different partners. As much as I advocate condom use and being open about STIs and HIV status (asking them,) there have been times where I slipped up. I personally think that it is one thing to advocate for safe sex and openness on these things, but I feel it is realistic and pragmatic to assume people are going to slip up, not know they are HIV+, or something else.

I have recently been prescribed Truvada for PrEP to prevent as an additional safety measure, potential exposure to HIV and to prevent myself from becoming HIV+. The blood tests to make sure I do not currently have HIV in my blood, STIs, and to establish a baseline for my liver (to see if the medication causes any shifts from the baseline) have just been done today, and I will know if I can begin Truvada as PrEp in the next 3-5 days.

I have read that Truvada can cause liver damage, lactic acidosis (?), and strange fat buildups in the neck area, moving fat and tissue away from the extremities (that scares me a lot!). However, I have been reading that the majority of people experience nausea and a little off for the first month or so and then they go back to normal, with no detectable shifts in their bloodwork / baseline afterwards.

I want to be safe. But I am fearful of the possible side effects and the unknown long-term effects. I usually am very against taking unnecessary medication. Does it make sense for me to take it? Are my fears a bit too paranoid? I want to be safe, but I am on the fence about taking it.

I have 3-4 days before the baseline blood tests come back and I want to try and decide before then if I should begin taking it. ~~I know once I begin, I can't really stop without building up an immunity to Truvada and thus it being less (or non-) effective should I ever become HIV+ in the future.~~  **(edit1: This is false. Disregard.)**

What are your thoughts? Anyone else on it's experiences? Any negative side effects? How long have you been on it?

Thanks in advance! This is really heavy on my mind right now and I just sort of want to talk about it with others...

&gt;**Q:** If I stop taking Truvada for PrEP, will I be more likely to contract HIV than I was before it started?
**A:** If you stop taking Truvada for PrEP, it does not make you more vulnerable to HIV infection.

--

&gt;**Q:** Once you start using PrEP, do you have to use PrEP forever?
**A:**No. You can discontinue using PrEP whenever you decide the protection it offers is no longer necessary, if you experience complications related to PrEP, or if you cannot manage to take a pill daily. However, it is advised that you continue taking PrEP for one month following your last possible exposure to HIV.

Even though they could definitely derive benefits from PrEP, whether because they have sex without condoms are because they just have multiple partners, they are not on it.

For me, the big issue is that PrEP, like drugs generally, are not covered by Ontario's OHIP. Without this coverage, the drugs are unaffordable to me. I have been told there are ways I might be able to game my insurance company to get covered, but I have not had time to investigate them. I have not been having sex with anyone in the meantime, so the question is moot. If the drugs were covered, I would definitely take them. I practice safer sex already, but I would like to be very sure. I have no concerns about Truvada's effectiveness, or about the ethics of the drug. Safer sex is safer sex.

My partner is on PrEP, I am not. We've been monogamous so far, but that's about to change, and I have some concerns, and it's a little complicated.

My man is a MD. Not just any MD, but one who specializes in HIV prevention and treatment. He also does rotations in a STD clinic and prescribes PrEP on a daily basis (so much so that he's become our town's ""PrEP doctor""), while also witnessing people seroconvert and test positive for every other bug in the universe. He is open about his sexuality in his field (and this gets out), so naturally over time his patients became almost exclusively gay men. My point is that he knows PrEP, sexual health, the community, and health in general very, very well (way better than I do).

Maybe because he is a doctor he is able to look at all of these medical conditions and the risks involved very objectively. Because of this, he is exclusively interested in bareback sex. He is on PrEP, and takes it every single day (not only that, but he's very familiar with the studies on effectiveness and their downfalls). He knows that any bacterial STD is treatable (aside from some rogue antibiotic resistant strain of something), and condoms are generally not effective against viral STIs, such as HPV and HSV (he has never expressed symptoms of either of these, not saying he doesn't already have them). I guess that leaves him with a very small chance of contracting HIV, knowing he can cure a bacterial STD, and that he can't adequately prevent interaction with a viral STD by using a condom...I'm not sure if that's exactly how he justifies himself, but that's all I can go off. Therefore, his position (in his words) is that he thinks ""bareback sex on PrEP is safe sex"" (to him).

I do not agree with this...but who am I to disagree with a doctor? I know that there is a big factor left out of this equation...and that's how indiscriminate he plans to be with his sexual endeavors. If he's barebacking close friends with trust and knowledge involved, that's one thing. But if he's meeting a guy casually online and breeding him that day later and then coming home to me...that's a whooooooole different story. It's gotten me worried, because I take my health seriously. I don't want warts on my ass or a monthly herpes outbreak and to be told ""it's just a minor skin irritation, it won't kill you."" I don't want to be comfortable with getting chlamydia or gonorrhea just because it won't kill me, but he is.

In conclusion, I feel like my opinion matters to me, but he's the all-knowing doctor. I like this guy a lot, but we haven't even made the jump to being open, and I'm worried already. I just feel very vulnerable. I don't know what to do."

I am curious to know if anyone else is on PrEP and what experience you have had. 
I decided to go on it two weeks ago. 
I made an appointment with a new doctor after getting great insurance from my work. I was strategic in my search: I found one that was covered by my insurance (duh), cute, and also an HIV specialist. I looked him up on Facebook and found out he had a lot of gay friends (though he is married - to a woman), so I knew it wouldn't be awkward asking him. 
Anyway, during my visit, we did a health questionnaire, he examined me, including my cock and nutsack (hot!), and then had me run blood tests and a urine analysis to assure my kidneys and liver were functioning in good shape. For those not aware, in order to be on PrEP, you must be HIV negative and also have good liver and kidney functions.
I then was prescribed PrEP and have been taking it for almost three weeks. The only symptom so far I have had is a decrease in hunger and some increase in diarrhea, which started in week two. 
Anyway, anyone else have an experience to share? Or anyone curious about PrEP and unsure?

http://www.newsweek.com/truvada-hiv-prevention-proves-highly-effective-368579

""This week, the private insurance company Kaiser Permanente released the largest population study to date that shows the drug is highly effective for preventing HIV transmission. The 2.5-year observational study, published this week in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, involved 657 people. On average, patients took the drug for approximately seven months. The report also provides some insight into whether taking Truvada impacts a person’s sexual behaviors, such as if the person is likely to have more sexual partners or use condoms less.

[. . .]

In the recent study by Kaiser Permanente, the average Truvada user was 37 years old and 99 percent were men who had sex with men. Overall Truvada users were more likely to have multiple sexual partners but not more likely to report having sexual partners who are known to be HIV-positive.

After six months, researchers asked 143 patients on Truvada about their sexual behaviors. In 74 percent of patients, the number of sexual partners hadn’t changed since beginning the drug. Fifteen percent reported having fewer sexual partners, and 11 percent reported an increased number of sexual partners since starting PrEP. More than half (56 percent) of study participants said they hadn’t changed their condom use behavior since starting the drug, while 41 percent admitted they used condoms less frequently.

Since the study didn’t include a control group, it’s not possible to know whether people on PrEP developed sexually transmitted infections (STIs) at a higher rate than people not on the drug, say the researchers. Patients were screened for STIs six months after beginning PrEP, and 30 percent were diagnosed with at least one STI. After one year on the drug, 50 percent of users were diagnosed with an STI, including 33 percent with a rectal STI; 33 percent with chlamydia; 28 percent with gonorrhea; and 5.5 percent with syphilis.""

I'd be on Truvada if I could. (Ontario, alas, combines a weak public drug program with perhaps excessive respect for Health Canada's non-identification of Truvada as a drug to be used as a prophylactic.) No, this is not because I want to get rid of my apartment and just rent out a sling at the local bathhouse. I just like the idea of doing more.

Would this mean I'd drop condoms entirely? No. Truvada-resistant mutations aside, contracting other STIs is nothing I'd like to do, while condom usage has just not been a problem for me. (Other people, mind, might have different priorities.)

Would it mean I'd use condoms less frequently? Possibly. Much depends on the circumstance.

Does this finding change your opinion on Truvada and PrEP?"

They post up disclaimers before the porn but nobody gives a shit about it.

My reasoning is that bareback porn is going to happen, because there's a market for that stuff and the guys who watch it MAY be at risk of participating in actual barebacking. While it's a fantasy for some, it only takes one moment of false judgement. Some gay bros who watch BB porn may not even be aware that PrEP exists.

Would it be better if there was scenes where the bottom would take a Truvada pill before barebacking, or even a top wearing a Gilead t shrit before he takes it off? I can see how it can backfire and Gilead ends up being seen as encouraging barebacking, so from a company image standpoint it won't be good.

Ive played with myself in the shower before; and usually ""clear myself"" using my fingers and some water. I usually use a dildo about 6 inches long, and maybe 6 in diameter.  It feels great so far, but shes worried about hurting me using a strap on.

Couple questions:

1. How do you clear yourself properly? The whole practice seems super weird to talk about, and shes slightly uncomfortable about it.

2. Is there anything I need to worry about as far as the dildo goes? Ive used it before with plenty of lube, but from time to time my stomach will hurt afterwards.

3. Is it possible to stretch the anus too much? Ive only done it a couple times, and I feel like maybe its too easy?

Were both just really curious about the whole thing, and any help is greatly appreciated. If I left anything out that you feel should be addressed, lemme know!"

This is how it will usually go. A dude that is self-proclaimed on PrEP in their profile will message me and get to talking. If he's attractive, I'll respond and eventually the conversation will start to change focus onto hooking up. We exchange a few nudes. I send him pictures of my booty, my hole and my penis so he can get a good idea of the entire package. They do the same (in no particular order.) Then they ask my status. I reply ""neg, u?"" Then they say, ""Neg on PrEP."" Then they always insist on going bare (this is before I even tell them I'm on PrEP.) This has happened numerous times, too many times to actually keep track of. I actually, don't like to disclose to my sexual partners that I'm on PrEP because I feel that with some guys it gives them free license to put my own sexual health at risk. 

Here's the thing; I like to fuck bare too (who doesn't?) but I don't like to fuck with guys who fuck bare often? Is that fucked up? I just can't do condoms, they're excruciatingly painful to me. I usually only fuck bare with guys who initially insist on safe sex. I am still trying to hash out the rational basis of my own choices and behavior. I don't want to go bare with guys that I know are on PrEP... but I, myself, am a guy that's on PrEP... so I suppose I wouldn't fuck myself.

Anyways the point of this post is: Why do people advertise on their profile that they are on PrEP? In my eyes, isn't that a magnet for HIV positive people or people who don't know and don't care about their status? The market for random hookups is rife with information asymmetry... couldn't freely disclosing your PrEP status result in a moral hazard problem?

To be frank, I have an extensive strategy, if you will, that I use for hooking up with guys that relies on a lot of [signaling and screening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_asymmetry#Signaling) and econometric modeling and analysis but that's a topic for another post."

Are you a fan of condoms? Who are we kidding, no one is! So how can sex be enjoyable if one must use them to stay safe?

Well, that was then and this is now. A miracle cure has been found and distilled into magic pills: PrEP! Talk to your doctor and get your prescription today. Take them with food, on an empty stomach, pop them like tic tacs, all that matters is that you take them!

So now you're full of PrEP and the miracle drug is swimming through your system, now what? Time to get on Grindr or your other favorite app, and get as many hookups lined up as you want. You can have sex with literally an endless amount of people and you'd still be protected!* Isn't it amazing?

Whether you're a top, bottom or vers, you will finally experience sex the way it was meant to be experienced! Aren't you excited?

Remember bros, play it safe and get on PrEP and you'll never have to worry about HIV (or condoms) again!

*Special thanks to /u/somekook and his wonderful [sticky](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/454cvg/follow_this_one_weird_trick_to_hook_up_with/) for spreading this very important message!*

**PrEP does not protect you from any other STIs, only HIV, but all other STIs are super manageable so you don't have to worry about it at all! Even HIV is totally manageable these days!*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**ALL OF THE ABOVE WAS SATIRE**

If you want to educate yourself on safe sex practices and see how dangerous /u/somekook's message really is, please read **ALL** the comments in my previous [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/46dlyc/psa_now_you_can_hook_up_with_thousands_of_people/).

Here are some of the highlights:

Let's start with what the [CDC has to say about PrEP and condoms](http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/prep.html):

&gt; **No, you should not stop using condoms because you are taking PrEP.** PrEP doesn’t give you any protection against other STDs, like gonorrhea and chlamydia. Also, while PrEP can significantly reduce your risk of HIV infection if taken daily, you can combine additional strategies like condom use with PrEP to reduce your risk even further.

/u/somekook does not agree with the CDC and has said that he will continue spreading the message that PrEP without condoms is an acceptable practice. When I told him to amend his sticky post, this is what he said:

/u/somekook:

&gt; Never going to happen. If anything, I'd edit it to be more pro-PrEP with fewer qualifiers.

Do you really want to take health advice from someone who didn't even know that herpes could be spread via anal sex? (Read the comments in the previous thread.)

/u/PSAmagicpill:

&gt; From /u/somekook's sticky post:

&gt; If you do have anal sex, use condoms and/**or** PrEP to protect yourself from HIV. 

/u/FdauditingGbro:

&gt; You're literally taking **ONE** line away from 2 solid paragraphs and reposting it as if that's the only thing he said. I'm not sure what your problem is, but clearly reading comprehension is one of them.

/u/PSAmagicpill:

&gt; One **VERY DANGEROUS** line.

&gt; It should be excised from the sticky or not be a sticky at all, because that one line is saying everything I'm saying in the OP here. And that's all kinds of fucked up.

/u/somekook and /u/libitum promote unsafe sex practices that could lead to more HIV infections in the gay community. Either they're willfully uneducated or they're both HIV+ and want more people to join them in their condition. Either way, they are spreading dangerous misinformation. The fact that /u/somekook's dangerous message was made a sticky in this sub is beyond irresponsible, it's downright criminal.

We're all adults here. Make your own choices. But do not willfully spread **MISINFORMATION** that could give those less informed the wrong idea.

**Do not use just PrEP without condoms. They are meant to be used together.**"
46ybag,[Serious] Am I really the only one worried about PrEP going around being passed out like candy?,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/46ybag/serious_am_i_really_the_only_one_worried_about/,worriedaboutthedrug,6,2/21/2016 16:57,32,/r/askgaybros/comments/46ybag/serious_am_i_really_the_only_one_worried_about/,NaN,"First off let me state some things:
-I feel everyone has the right to healthcare 
-I feel everyone should be encouraged to protect themselves from infection
-I feel everyone should be able to enjoy sex in any form they want.


Phew now that is out of the way... on to the topic.
PrEP is being handed out very very very very easily and while it is a critical lifestyle drug and purely preemptive (as the name would suggest), it is still being given too easily. I am the first however to state that we need to have a way to protect ourselves from infection, and should do everything in our power to prevent the spread of any infection. No one should have to suffer. Period. PrEP is a means to that end.

The drug has been shown to not have any alarming side effects, even with long term use. That isn't what this topic is about.

What my concern is, is that this drug has been disseminated over the gay community (and straight of course) and a lot of people are thinking all of a sudden it is safe to bearback with eachother. Why? Because they can't get HIV. And now people are throwing a lot of risk to the side.

Should the drug make people feel safer? No shit it should. It is effective, proven and safe as a drug. 

But what I am seeing at clinics in my profession is a lot of guys who are engaging in sex without a condom and are ignoring every other infection out there. This is a problem, because (ignoring healthcare coverage costs) PreP does not make you ""immune"" to other STDs (not even ""immune"" to HIV infection, despite it's proven efficacy in such-- but that is an aside).

So what do we see? A lot of BB sex. A lot of infections are being cast aside and ignored/considered trivial. But the fact is these are not all trivial. Herpes, Chlamydia, (the overly common) HPV, etc. A lot of our younger gay population are engaging in riskier behaviour under the ridiculous guise prep is some godlike immunity pill. And they are putting themselves at risk

Further, in old ""easily treatable"" infections we're seeing the rise of resistant strains of common STDs like gonorrhea and others (Even HIV itself)
http://www.cdc.gov/std/gonorrhea/arg/

Also, as an aside, we're forgetting big pharma's hand in this. Under the current healthcare plans in the USA there are typically a limited number of drugs that any one person can have at a time, now with multiple STDs being treated we may very commonly see this as a patient's portfolio of drugs:

-PreP
-acyclovir (herpes) ?
-Another STD treatment
-Another STD treatment

Now what happens if the individual gets some other sort of infection or needs a painkiller? Tooth infection? What about simple puffers? Those are a drug and typically on healthcare. The process to get more drugs on there is not as simple as one may suspect.

What this leads to is people under the misguided interpretation that prep will keep them safe obtaining a long bill of medications they need to maintain and upkeep from a young age. I saw a 20 year old this morning who had a page just like this. He has a long LONG life ahead of himself and has tied himself until his death day (or a cure is found) to big pharma. That is fucked up.


IN CLOSING:
I think while we spread joy about prep we do not forget about safe sex practices. I'm seeing too many young people ignorantly be shocked with the results of tests indicating they are positive for multiple various infections, stating how they took prep and only slept with ""safe"" guys. 

Always practice safe sex and logic.

I've been getting more and more frustrated with the way people talk about PreP and gay sexuality in general. I've read a lot of (sometimes more, sometimes less reasonable) posts about it, and I've been wondering if I am the only one excited about PreP.  

First I wanna try to sum up what kind of arguments are out there. Basically, what a lot of people are saying is this: 

1. On PreP, the 'bad' slutty gay guys are gonna start creaming asses bareback like crazy. Barebacking is bad.

2. What about all those other STD's? Ohwmagawd, stuff could get resistant to antibiotics!

3. A responsible guy who goes on PreP would use the Pills AND Condoms, because PreP isn't 100% safe.

4. PreP sluts are gonna cause resistant strains of the HI-Virus.

Did I miss something? I hope I got all of it.

About Point 1:

A lot(!) of people are already having bareback sex. We would NOT have the whole HIV-Epidemic if everybody just always used condoms. In a 2008 Study, 30% of gay men reported condomless sex with a casual partner. That was before TaP was even heard of (The Swiss Statement dropped in 2008), so I imagine the numbers are even higher now. Is that a bad thing? Why do we as gay men constantly have to label the shit we do as 'bad' or 'good'. 
I don't do bareback sex. I am very scared of HIV. But to be honest, a little part of me is jealous of the people reckless enough to just go with it. I watch tons of bareback porn. And be fucking real with yourself – you do too. Bareback Porn is fucking exploding. Sean Cody is dropping bareback movies for fucks sake. Why do you think do they do that? 

Easy:
Sex without condoms is way hotter. Can we all please, please, please stop being so fucking hypocritical about that. On EVERY fucking Porn-Streaming Site the most watched videos are bareback. That's not my opinion and that's not 'bad' – it's just the way it is.
So yes, with PreP becoming more available, Condom use is gonna go down. Because Prep protects you against HIV, and because if it wasn't for HIV, most of us would not use condoms at all. 
If it wasn't for HIV, the whole sexual revolution of the 60's and 70's would have gone on, and the whole way most of us were socialized and educated about sex would have been completely different.

That bring's me to point 2. Other STD's. 

What is the big deal? First of all, even if you use condoms consistently, you still can catch other STD's. 
The risk is reduced for anal, but who the fuck uses condoms for oral? Be real about that. The whole argument is ridiculous. You can get Syphilis, Herpes, Gonorrhea and Chlamydia through oral. At least if people are on PreP, they get screened for that shit way more often than they would if they weren't. I know this might be uncomfortable, but if you are sexually active at all, you are at risk. 
But hey, good news. All of that shit is (still) treatable. 
And you know what else? Even if every single gay guy cut off his dick and turned to priesthood, those STD's still will end up resistant to antibiotics at some point. Straight people have sex too, and straight people also get STD's. Why is it that we blame our gross, 'bad' gay sexual desires for something that basically everybody is responsible for. Our Sex, and the STD's we catch are in no way morally worse than the infections of like, the other fucking 90% of the planet. 

About Point 3:

That actually is the dumbest thing I have heard so far. Yes, If you want to be super safe, you can use condoms and PreP. Nothing wrong with that. You could also fucking wrap your whole body in cling wrap and rub your dick on the corner of a table while your hookup who stands three feet away from you does the same. 
I'm not saying that you shouldn't use condoms while on PreP, but the KAISER Study actually has pretty sweet results. No new Infections. 99% 
I know, there is a problem with adherence, but even with people only taking four of seven pills a week, the level of protection was over 80%. Consistent condom use reduces your HIV risk by 70%! PREP IS SAFER THAN CONDOMS!
So you could just as well say someone who only uses condoms for every single encounter is doing something wrong if he doesn't additionally go on PreP. If all you do is look at the risk of HIV-transmission, only taking Prep and getting your ass creamed every other night is preferable to using condoms. Condoms break. 

I'm almost done, I promise. About point 4. 

Yeah, that might be a thing. It also might not be if people are adherent. We also might see some sort of long lasting PreP/Vaccine Injection that we could get within the next decade and that only has to be renewed like once a month. Adherence would be pretty easy with that.
Also, this: 
http://www.aidsmap.com/Drug-resistance-acquired-during-HIV-PrEP-rapidly-disappears-after-medication-is-discontinued/page/3020093/

So, to finish this off, I wanna talk about HIV in general. What's up with the fucking stigma around here? Think about this for a second:
Medically, Diabetes is way worse than HIV. With Diabetes, shit only gets worse. With HIV, some studies actually show that your lifespan increases, because most negative people don't get a complete checkup and bloodwork done every four months. 
So why do we judge people who have bareback sex, but are completely fine with fat people. Maybe that comparison doesn't work perfectly, but I guess you get my point. 
So if you are like me, if you are reading way too long discussions about HIV and PreP on reddit, you probably also have HIV-Phobia or some sort of fucking OCD going on. Why the fuck would you still be reading otherwise? I ask you this: 
Do you also sometimes, even if everything you did on your last hookup was safe and all your fears are irrational, have this tiny voice in your head that goes: 'If you just weren't gay, your HIV risk would be lower. Just by having gay sex you are doing something wrong, and if you end up with HIV, it's your fault.'? 
I sometimes do. It sucks. But that is fucking classic internalized gay-self-hatred and has nothing to do with PreP. We should get over that.

I'm a healthy hiv negative 29 year old male that applied for individual long term disability insurance coverage. The initial quote after taking a medical exam and filling out the application was $200/month. I told them I was taking Truvada for Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis. I just got a letter today after they've gotten my medical records that I've been rated up and my premium is now $2,400/month due to use of HIV Prophylactic Medication and that they would deny any disability claims that are a result of contracting HIV should I contract HIV.

PrEP reduces the risk of contracting HIV by 99%. Yes, I'm still using condoms. If anything, I am far less riskier than the general population and it should be a premium discount. Paying $28,800 a year for disability is ridiculous and if I could save that amount I wouldn't need disability insurance. It's like getting an annual flu shot and having disability insurance not cover anything related to the flu.

What are my options? I feel like I need to talk to a lawyer. What, if anything, would they maybe be able to accomplish?

If so, should I just use warm water? I've heard some people use Epsom Salts (sounds like a terrible mixture but whatever)?

My partner is uncircumcised. Other than not pulling too hard, anything I should avoid during oral sex?

Also I have some wonky kegel muscles. Apparently some people have trouble with them? I guess I've been training mine ever since I was potty trained. But when I masturbate, I get strange ""involuntary"" kegel clenches, where I do it consciously but I can't resist doing it. When I first started to masturbate, this instinct was so intense I put jacking off off for years! I actually feel this has an effect on my pleasure, because when I try hard to resist (by loosening every muscle) it feels soooo much better, but I can only go about 20 seconds without another clench. Does everyone feel like that? Interestingly, I have trouble relaxing them between clenches during orgasm, and often only get 2 or 3 clenches out before my penis permanently tightens for a few minutes. 

Anyway this extends to my anus. I feel that if I were to ride him (which I want to do) my leg muscles flexing to move my legs would tighten my anus. And I don't want to choke his dick in my butthole. Any tips?"

What if you are in a monogamous relationship and frequently have bareback sex, but your partner is HIV negative?
-I bring up this situation because i've been hearing lots of horror stories of people cheating on their partners and infecting them. You can say you trust your partner, but if it were me, i wouldn't want to leave my health up to anybody but myself.

Would you take prep in these relatively low risk situations? It seems to me that the potential preventive benefits greatly outweigh the costs to taking the medication. I think it would give me peace of mind to know that i have an extra level of protection, and i still tend to worry about my status (until i get tested) even if i always use a condom.

There are often posts about PrEP and it seems like people are completely or partially confused about it. As a medical doctor, your posts have made me question my own knowledge. Now while I am an anesthesiologist and don't really deal with this on a daily basis, I like to have the most up to date knowledge on any subject. Luckily I also enjoy research so I went digging around for journal articles to make a comprehensive mini-guide to PrEP.

**1. Introduction**

New HIV infections remain a problem worldwide. In the US alone there are over 30,000 new infections in MSM (men who have sex with men) annually, especially in the young MSM and MSM of color populations. There is also a rise in other STDs, and syphilis specifically increased by almost 50% in MSM between 2010 and 2014. Rectal STDs increase the chance of HIV seroconversion by 2.7 times. The PROUD study found that 64% of men had been diagnosed with a STD in the previous year and 44% used drugs to reduce sexual inhibition. One study found that almost 50% of men have had unprotected sex in the past 3 months, and 8% have unprotected sex more than once a week. Groups that show a higher incidence of unprotected sex are young MSM and those in apparently monogamous relationships.

**2. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis**

The most commonly used drug is Truvada, a combination pill of two drugs - tenofovir and emtricitabine. The PROUD study showed that taking PrEP routinely reduced HIV infection rates by 86%, and the Ipergay study showed that infection rates were reduced by 86% in men who take Truvada before sex only. Other studies suggest that the protection may be much greater with only 2 men converting out of 657 in the PrEP Demonstration Project. PrEP users and physicians who prescribe PrEP are attempting to overcome a stigma potentiated by various individuals and even celebrities who have given rise to terms such as 'truvada whores' in people who wish to use PrEP. Studies of PrEP show such effectiveness that European and US medical advisory committees are attempting to urgently integrate it into regular protocols for HIV prevention. PrEP is free in many European countries and is part of several projects to accelerate its widespread use. Interest in PrEP among US MSM is very high, especially in men who are highly educated about HIV and PrEP and those who have regular unprotected sex.

**Official Indications for taking PrEP**

* MSM who engage in unprotected anal sex
* Individuals who take part in a HIV serodiscordant relationship
* Transgender individuals who take part in high risk activity
* Transactional sex workers
* Certain intravenous drug users
* Individuals who use stimulant drugs and take part in high risk behavior
* Individuals who have been diagnosed with an anogenital STD within the past year

**Dosing**

Daily dosing of Truvada leads to highly effective drug levels after one week. Rectal cells show high levels of Truvada after 7 doses with 94% protection. After stopping Truvada, drug levels persist but people who have engaged in high risk activity should continue to take it for another four weeks to protect themselves from lingering sources of infection. In the Ipergay study men used what is called demand-dosing and took 2 tablets 2-24h before sex, then one tablet 24 and 48h after sex. The average Ipergay participant used 16 pills per month, about half that of a regular doser. Intermittent dosing may be as effective as regular dosing but it is also likely that men who take intermittent doses (at least 15 pills per month) are more protected than men who occasionally take Truvada due to a quieter sex life. In other studies they found relatively good adherence with most men taking their pills regularly without missing a dose if they decided to take Truvada daily.

**Side Effects**

The most common side effects in the PROUD study were nausea, headache and sore joints. About 93% of men have some sort of mild side effect. About 14% of men get gastrointestinal complaints like diarrhea or cramps. 8% of participants found the side-effects difficult to deal with. Truvada is associated with a decrease in kidney function but it is non-progressive and reversible after stopping the drug (within 4-8w it is normal). About 18% of men experience these kidney changes. Doctors can draw blood to test kidney functions on a yearly basis. 17% of men get raised liver enzymes and these are also monitored, and Truvada does also not affect those who have active hepatitis negatively. For those of you who want natural kids one day, Truvada was found not to affect fertility in men. Truvada does lower your bone mineral density over time and there are concerns that it may lead to osteoporosis and easy fractures in your later life. This is still up for debate because long term data is lacking. One trial found that Truvada is about as safe as aspirin - however one should also appreciate that aspirin is an over the counter drug that leads to several potentially serious problems like gastric ulcers and bleeding, and therefore the trial is not saying that both are extremely safe but rather that both have occasional side effects.

**Resistance**

People are worried that Truvada will lead to resistance in anti-retroviral regimens for treating HIV infected patients. A study found that resistance is rare due to PrEP, is much more common in patients being treated for HIV, and that the benefits of PrEP far outweigh the dangers of resistance.

**Future PrEP**

Two drugs, Cabotagrevir and Rilpivirine are under investigation for injectable PrEP. Both have tremendously long half lives and can be given 3-monthly as a single shot. There are some minor problems being investigated in this area such as injection site pain and high volume. In a study of MSM in New York, 80% of respondents said that they would rather take an injectable than a pill.

**Summary**

* High risk practices and new HIV infections are high in many MSM communities.
* Other STDs are common in MSM and greatly increase the uptake of HIV.
* Truvada is profoundly effective as PrEP (upwards of 90% or more) but infections do still occur.
* Truvada can be given daily, or as a regimen prior to sex.
* There is a stigma around PrEP that needs to be addressed.
* Most medical authorities believe that PrEP should be widely available and encouraged in high risk populations.
* Mild side effects are common and serious side effects are rare.
* Kidney function may decrease and osteoporosis may be a long term issue with regular use.
* Drug resistance is not an issue.
* Injectable PrEP is on the horizon.

Guys I really hope someone finds this useful. Remember that your physician should be your first reference in all these matters not the internet.

tl dr - If you have a lot of random sex and if condoms sometimes aren't used, get PrEP.

56a2gn,Do you think it's smart to tell guys you're on PrEP?,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/56a2gn/do_you_think_its_smart_to_tell_guys_youre_on_prep/,TruvadaKedavra,4,10/6/2016 23:30,16,/r/askgaybros/comments/56a2gn/do_you_think_its_smart_to_tell_guys_youre_on_prep/,NaN,"I was thinking about it the other day and I don't think it's smart for a number of reasons. Sex involves information asymmetry. You can never know the full picture of your sexual partner's sexual history. Giving someone new information can change their sexual calculus - it can change how they view you and how they choose to treat you. If a guy assumes you're on PrEP then he can be more cavalier sexually - like feel it's ok to not tell you he's undetectable or poz because he knows you're on PrEP and the risk is ""low."" Or be more inclined to bareback since you're on PrEP, therefore increasing the likelihood of riskier sexual practices and the risk of acquiring STIs. Moreover, a lot of people think guys on PrEP engage in far riskier sexual practices and there's actually a lot of data to suggest that is the case so perhaps it could turn off a partner who would think the guy that is ""Neg on PrEP"" is actually a truvada whore. [Gay/bi men exponentially more likely to contract STIs](http://www.newnownext.com/prep-sexually-transmitted-diseases/09/2016/) This would be a negative reaction to new information. 

So is it smart to tell people you are on PrEP? Are we telling our hookups too much information? Guys on PrEP, do you advertise that you are on PrEP on your dating profiles?"

&gt;A second man taking the daily HIV-prevention pill Truvada has been infected by a rare drug-resistant strain of the virus.
The results were presented by Cleveland Clinic HIV specialist Howard Grossman, who unveiled the finding at the 2016 HIV Research for Prevention conference in Chicago on Tuesday.
The patient, who is not releasing his name or age to protect his privacy, is a gay man who had been taking the drug daily since January 2016. Hair and blood tests confirmed that he had the appropriate blood levels of the pill’s two drugs — tenofovir and emtricitabine — to offer the nearly 99% protection it offers from the virus when taken daily.

&gt;The patient’s long-term partner is HIV-positive but on treatment, with an undetectable viral load in his body. On two occasions and with two separate people, however, the couple had condomless sex with a third person.

&gt;Grossman found that the patient’s strain of HIV was resistant to both of the drugs in Truvada, as well as all of the other drugs in its class, which work by blocking one of the enzymes needed by the virus to reproduce. The new strain did not match his partner’s, meaning that the multi-drug-resistant virus must have been transmitted during one of the two sexual encounters.

&gt;The man, who is now HIV-positive, is on a mixture of antiretroviral drugs and has his infection under control, Grossman said.
&gt;The first documented case of a person on daily Truvada being infected with the virus was announced in February. For now, experts suggest that the cases should not be cause for alarm.
“We know PrEP is not 100% effective, and that’s something we need to be saying loudly and clearly,” Mitchell Warren, executive director of AVAC, a global HIV-prevention advocacy group in New York City, told BuzzFeed News. “No prevention method — other than abstinence — is.”
&gt;But while the risk exists, it needs to be weighed against the pill’s well-demonstrated benefits, Warren said. “We have now seen hundreds of thousands of people on oral PrEP, and we’ve only seen two cases of so-called breakthrough infections.”
&gt;Instead, Warren urged that we need better surveillance to track and identify the prevalence of drug-resistant strains of the virus. “This is a virus that’s been around for 35 years — it’s so variable and mutates so rapidly — and that’s one of the biggest challenges for developing any prevention.”
&gt;Grossman agreed that the new case should not cause those taking or considering taking PrEP to reconsider using the drug out of fear.
&gt;“Truthfully, PrEP is the best intervention we’ve ever had to prevent HIV,” he said. “I don’t think we’re going to see some huge explosion of failures. I think it’s going to be a sort of trickle, if anything.”

The doctor did mention I was on a very low risk and the bottom *claimed to* be on PrEP but I had my doubts and I started PEP (and hence the delay in starting PrEP). Had some side effects at 2 weeks in PEP but they subsided. And I did not hook up or even go on a date in those 4 weeks I was on PEP (I said I was paranoid).  

Here's the deal: That time I barebacked was in the top 10 sexual encounters I've ever had and I think I came A LOT more than usual. Now I am torn: Between my desire to bring back those feelings I had once accidentally and being 100% safe all of the time (as I plan to despite being on PrEP).  

I understand statistically PrEP is more effective than condoms and I never skip a dose (7 days/week) but there are other STIs to think about. I am sort of having some trouble choosing between my own paranoia and the effectiveness of PrEP by itself."

I've just avoided hooking up with guys because I said to myself I'd only do so if I got on PREP.  But I am nervous to tell my doctor I want to get on it.  I'm not out at all.  Do I even need it, or are condoms really sufficient?  Couldn't I also get HIV from giving blowjobs?"

5lxzat,My doctor wants me to be apart of the Descovy Discover PrEP Phase 3 trial.

My primary doctor is very knowledgeable about hiv medications/etc. He's having concerns about possible bone loss if I keep taking Truvada in my specific case and so he wants me to consider taking part in the Descovy PrEP Phase 3 trial. It is a double blind study lasting 96 weeks where I could either be given Truvada + a placebo or Descovy + a placebo. I have a 50% chance of being on Descovy.

Both Truvada and Descovy have  emtricitabine  as one of the active ingredients and has tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) while truvada has tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). According to my doctor TAF is thought to be more absorbed into various cells including rectal tissue/etc while 50% of TDF remains in the blood stream which may be why it can cause so many kidney &amp; bone issues. The tenofovir dosage is a lot less on Descovy.

The hugest risk in taking part in this study is Descovy may not work as effectively or at all for PrEP. 

As far as I know there is no compensation for taking part in the study of Descovy. The benefit is I would get it for free and STD testing for free but my health insurance already covers PrEP at 100% no cost to me and the every 3 months office visits I won't have to pay a $50 co-pay. To be honest I'm a bit disappointed that a 97 billion dollar market cap company isn't providing any sort of compensation for the risk involved in the study. I really hope I don't sound selfish as I do greatly appreciate how much work they've done for the community. I think my life may be very well different without PrEP. The biggest benefit is that I get to help Gilead with their research into new innovative drugs.

What are your thoughts bros? Would you take part in the study? Why or why not?"

I'm recently single and getting back into the dating world.  I'm a condoms guy, but all my gay-oriented buddies have been pressuring me to go on PrEP (even though I would use condoms either way).

I came across an interesting post [here](http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2014/12/31/the-best-threads-of-2014-why-arent-gay-men-on-the-pill/) that describes Truvada as only providing a 2% increase in protection over inferred condom use.

I just wanted to get the gaybro consensus.

I'm typically medication adverse unless I absolutely need it.  Candidly speaking, I have 3 bottles of Truvada sitting on my desk that I haven't cracked yet.  I've been hemming and hawing about taking it.  I guess I'm worried about long-term side effects.  More importantly, I'm wondering if this med will impact sexual function, libido, etc.

I always use condoms but the paranoia is a boner killer. I've thought about going to a doctor to see if I could get prep but I'm on my parents insurance atm and I don't want them to know so I haven't gone. 

Are there any bad side effects? Do we know if there are any possible long term side effects?

Also one of my friends is pretty openly bi and he's introduced me to this other hot bi dude and we ended up making out and blowing each other. But while we were making out I noticed he had a small cut on his lip and it wasn't really bleeding but I thought I tasted blood in my mouth. 

From what my friend told me and what the hot guy told me, he also only plays safe and was tested a few months ago. I don't think he has HIV or anything, but I'm wondering in the event that someone did have HIV and they had a cut on their lip and we made out, is the likely of contracting HIV high in that scenario? Especially if it might've bled and I tasted blood in my mouth?

Thanks in advance mates"

I'm 20 years, partially out, and I actually just made 1 year of losing my virginity. An important aspect of this story was that all of these hookups originated from grindr. Now I topped the first time, topped a couple more times, gave/receive oral more times. In this last year of my sexual escapades, I have attempted to bottom twice. The first time was a success (?) since the guy was able to fit in me relatively easy cause he had a small penis. Truth be told there were times when I truly did not feel a thing. (For the remainder of the day I thought maybe he didn't even go inside me at all, but quickly discovered that to be untrue when later that night when I was wiping my ass I discovered blood.) So that was the first time bottoming. I unfortunately got cocky (no pun intended) and when it came down to try it again with an average to large sized guy I couldn't fit him in and then ended up in the most embarrasing sexual encounter ever. The guy was really nice about it and didn't give me a hard time about it all. So that was the second time, a failure. So fast forward to a couple of weeks ago, I'm on grindr and I find the second guy on there again ( I went through a period of not having grindr, lost contact blah blah blah irrelevant details). We chat up, we talk a little bit, and we come to the decision that we would make great friends with benefits to practice on. (I'm 20, he's 18. Two horny young guys, do the math). So he couldn't host that day and he actually went back up for college the next day for another 3 weeks. So what I'm getting at is this... are there any routines I can do nightly to prepare to bottom for him. We said that we would keep the line of communication about sex open so if it hurts stop, go slower etc., but I genuiely do want the next time to be better than the last time. Any advice would be greatly appreciated !!! The patient top is only as good as the eager bottom :)  (Sidebar: Before anyone says anything in the comments, I am purely in this for the physical aspect. I am a sex postive man who believes sex is a great thing that can be shared with anyone as long as it consensual and safe. I believe in intimacy but that is not what I am looking for. Please no comments about my age, confusion about love or anything of that nature. Strictly sex. Thank you.)"

I recently got a prescription for Truvada. When I went to pick it up from the pharmacy, they told me my copay was $1500. Then I went online and found the Gilead coupon, which says it covers up to $3600 a year in copay. I took that back to the pharmacy, and got the first month prescription for free. I assume next month will be free as well, but then after that, the prices will skyrocket after the Gilead coupon runs out.

This is a prescription from my doctor, not from a PREP clinic. I do have insurance, it just doesn't cover much of the cost. The prescription is $1800 a month, and insurance covers $300 a month.

How do I go about getting a better price for this prescription?"

I was eligible for the co-pay assistance because I was not able to have a job for a variety of reasons. I now have a temp job, sort of an internship, which pays me ok but I am a little above the income for Gilead to be eligible for PrEP.  

If I pay out of pocket I'll be in another debt soon and I don't have an insurance that covers prescriptions. I am not eligible for work insurance (medical) because it's a temp job. Whatever little savings I do have will have to be saved for the next two semesters at school because it's gonna be a big amount and my savings will barely cover it.  

So my question is -- apart from paying out of pocket or through insurance (neither of which is the case here), what are my other options here?  

I always, always play safe but I am a little hypochondriac especially after that one incident that happened a little while before I started PrEP.  

I had almost given up on doing anything physical until I came across PrEP, which at the very least let me breathe a sigh of relief and didn't cause me to panic after every encounter (again, all of which were safe).  

I applied for Gilead assistance with a special scenario case where I do have a job and an income but it's temporary, but they denied my request.

I've also heard that many people are able to get it cheaply or free from their insurance as it would drastically save the company money compared to having to pay for hiv treatment.

The only other notable thing that has happened in the last 10 days is that I broke a glass and got a cut on my finger (which is almost completely healed now).  

I got tested twice in the last two weeks and everything seems ok in that area. Also, haven't hooked up in a month.

Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago is doing an online research assessing the experiences and attitudes of young Latino men who have sex with men and trans* Latinas when it comes to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a once a day pill that helps prevent HIV. The goal of this study is to understand and improve PrEP access in Latinx communities. 

You will be compensated $30 in the form of a money order if you complete the survey, and you will have the opportunity to earn an additional $20 if you refer two eligible friends to the study.

Here are the details:

**WHAT IS VOCES LATINX?**

Voces Latinx: The Chicago PrEP Opinions Survey is an online survey study that we think can help improve PrEP access for Latinx MSM and trans* Latinas here in Chicago. Participants are asked to share their thoughts about PrEP and also experiences with health care providers. The study is run by psychologist, Dr. Marco Hidalgo, and funded by Emory University’s Center for AIDS Research (CFAR).

**WHAT WILL STUDY PARTICIPANTS BE ASKED TO DO?**

It’s a 25-30 minute online questionnaire surveying their attitudes about HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). They will also be asked about their experiences with healthcare providers. We’re collecting this information because we think it can help improve PrEP access in Latinx communities here in Chicago.

**IN WHAT LANGUAGES IS THE SURVEY AVAILABLE?**

The survey is available in both English and Spanish.

**WILL RESPONDENTS BE PAID FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION?**

Yes, up to $50. Here’s how: Participants will be compensated $30 cash if they complete the survey, and they will have the opportunity to earn an additional $20 if someone they referred also completes the survey.

**HOW MANY RESPONDENTS ARE NEEDED FOR THIS STUDY AND BY WHEN?**

We're looking to enroll 100 participants by July 31, 2017!

And I get the logic; if the guy feels a need to be on PrEP, he's most likely spreading on the regular, and most likely not to the same partner. Even if it's not true, I understand why some people might think of guys on PrEP that way; I can see the logic.

What do you think? Do guys on PrEP get judged by other gays? Do you personally think less of guys on PrEP? 

I feel like if there is this stigmatization, I'm afraid it keeps some guys from being on PrEP, which might lead to them catching something, which obviously is a problem; and I don't think we can fix the problem if we don't talk about it.

They're all about PrEP. 

I am not extremely sexually active. I'll have a partner maybe once or twice a month. I'll also go through droughts where I have no drive. In the past year, I've had maybe 6 different partners. The majority were mostly just hookups. 

I was the bottom and used condoms in all but one encounter. I regret not using one but it was a very heat of the moment type thing. He assured me that he was clean and I honestly believe him. I'm sure many of you think this is a horror story. To add to the horror, I didn't get screened afterwards. Now it's time for the jump scare: I've actually never been screened for anything ever. 

I know, scary. That's why I am going to change that. This is the first time that I've been independent with my own income and ability to get myself screened without making it a family matter. Which leads me to my first question: how do I do that? Do I just call my local hospital and tell them I need a sex doctor? Should I try for a specialized clinic near me? 

I'm living under the assumption that I am HIV- still. Provided that this is true, I am interested in getting started on PrEP. It's so cumbersome (pun intended) having to worry every time I want a nice dick if I'm going to catch the AIDS. I would also like to enjoy bareback every now and again. I don't want to have to be afraid to swallow. 

So here's my next set of questions: should I ask my screener about prescribing PrEP to me? I would assume both a hospital doctor or a specialized clinic doctor would be capable. 

Also, I'm curious about the post-insurance cost? What are some of you fine folks paying for your monthly prescription? I've read that it's about $1300 per month sans insurance. I saw one testimonial that he was paying only $70 per month. I would gladly pay a second phone bill to avoid HIV. 

So, yeah, help a gay bro out? "

As the title says, I'm on PrEP and I'm hiding it from the guy I've been dating for 3 months. To clarify, I'm not on PrEP because I'm cheating or because I have regularly engaged in risky behaviour. I'm just very overkill about protecting my health. 

So, the guy I've been dating is awesome and I can see myself falling for him. We trust each other as much as can be expected and I don't think he is the type to cheat, but the relationship is still pretty young. Also, we've decided to forego condoms moving forward. Now, like I said, I trust him as much any person can trust someone else after knowing them for a couple of months, but I want to continue to protect my health in the eventuality that he makes a mistake. I know he has had quite a few slutty phases and he's quite popular (he's objectively attractive), so whilst I trust him and think he won't fuck up what we have, I'm not stupid enough to leave myself completely unprotected this early on. I've heard of way too many guys who have contracted HIV because of their partners cheating on them. I'm not trying to become part of that statistic. 

But, I don't want to discuss it with him because A) he will think I don't trust him - I do, but my priority is always myself - or B) he will think I'm cheating. I also know how non-confrontational I am, and I don't want to get into a conversation and in the heat of the moment, agree to stop taking PrEP. 

I guess I'm asking this to get some opinions from other guys about the situation. How would you react if you were in my bf's position?"

I'm not a medical professional and so I really can't interpret medical literature relating to PrEP/pharmacology and instead rely on my GP and *.edu or *.gov sites I find on Google to summarise it for me. I'm imagining that statistics are used to say to something like ""in x-percent of patients on PrEP, who engage in some range and frequency of risky activities over time-t, y-percent will remain HIV-negative"". And if 'y' is deemed to be a good number then professionals say that ""PrEP works"". Is that how it works? I've been on a PrEP trial in my country (Australia) for the last 4 months and I'm curious if PrEP can ever fail even if the daily dosage is strictly adhered to. Like considering a very bad case, e.g. if you allow yourself to have a sustained exposure to HIV from a group of highly-detectable hiv-positive tops, and their HIV virus particles entered your blood, will that lower the efficacy of PrEP? What are the ""limits"" of a properly-administered course of PrEP? And how are they defined? At what concentration of virus vs. PrEP per unit volume of blood will those long-life memory T cells be ""screwed""? 

I'm also curious about side effects after seeing my latest blood/urine/swabs results. Specifically, how are the thresholds defined that say, for e.g., a protein level of 'x' mmol/L (or whatever the units are) in your quarterly urine samples means that your kidneys aren't coping with PrEP vs. ""oh it's all fine, keep taking it""? Do these thresholds vary from person to person based on age, body/organ size or whether I drink a lot beer or use cannabis? I wasn't rigorously questioned about a lot of things and I can't help but be concerned that PrEP is treated like some one-size-fits-all treatment thrown out to everyone when it probably shouldn't be approached that way at all. But what would I know, I'm not a doctor..."

Are you guys getting fully prepped or do you just not worry about being 100% absolutely clean? I've only done anal with committed boyfriends and I've specifically prepped for it and usually shower directly beforehand, but I would like to get more experience.

I'm a 27 y/o bi guy. I just had my appointment with my doctor regarding getting started on PrEP; my labs were all negative and I'm good to go.

My doctor did tell me, however, that before she prescribes PrEP for me, she wants me to be aware that simply taking Truvada *MIGHT* make it difficult or even impossible for me to acquire life insurance or long-term health insurance down the line. 

She said that because insurance companies mainly look at your labs and medications when determining whether or not to sell you a policy, there is a possibility that they may conclude that because you're on Truvada, you're inherently at higher risk of acquiring HIV and would therefore either not qualify for a policy or would have to pay a higher premium.

She knows that this is irrational, since the whole point of PrEP is to *reduce* your likelihood of becoming infected, especially as it's supposed to be taken in *addition* to other measures like condom use and social screening. She says that despite this, some companies may still see you as too risky to insure.

Life and long-term care insurance are definitely part of my retirement plans, and I hate the idea of not being able to acquire them simply because I'm taking steps to look after my health.

Would anyone be willing to share your experiences in acquiring/trying to acquire life and long-term care insurance while on PrEP?

Thanks!"

I was more or less fine until Tuesday of this week, when I woke up with nausea; throughout that day the abdominal pain returned and  became so severe that I had trouble walking. At this point I tried reaching out to my prescribing doctor, but ended up playing phone tag with the nurse -- to no avail. Wednesday, the pain seemed to let up, and I just experienced some minor soreness. But yesterday, Thursday, the pain became just as bad, if not worse, than Tuesday. 

This morning I went to my university's health services and the doctor did a physical examination of my abdomen. He thinks he narrowed the source of my pain down to either my pancreas or liver. He discussed my medication with the pharmacy and now I'm at the ER, which is slammed .... I'm waiting for a room to become available so they can do blood work.

What kind of held me back was the fact that I'm on a high deductible plan, and very rarely need to go to the doctor, so my whole deductible would go towards PReP.

But I recently heard about this magical Gilead co-pay card and mine just arrived in the mail, so now I want to make sure I understand how this works.

My deductible is at $1300 and barely touched, and I think the card covers up to $3600 of prep. Sooo does that actually mean I can max my deductible just with prep, and then get anything else I need at the doctor unrelated to that fully covered by my insurance? If so I would be stupid not to actually get PReP since it would actually lower my overall yearly health costs, am I understanding correctly?

Secondly, how much does it cost per year to be covered by PReP? Is the card enough to cover 100%? If not, if I'm not mistaken my insurance would take care of the rest since the card would help me meet the deductible, is that right?

And lastly, how do I go about asking for PReP at my doctor's? I'm getting a new doctor because my company changed insurance, so do I just barge in in our first meeting and say I'd like to be put on PReP? A bit nervous about this.

I know I should ask my doctor/pharmacist these questions, but I’m the first patient my primary care physician has prescribed Truvada for and he’s not all that familiar with it; he’s looking into my questions but couldn’t give me immediate answers. I tried to talk to the pharmacist about it a bit yesterday, but the pharmacist on duty was an old lady who seemed somewhat judgmental while I talked to her so I cut the conversation short - maybe I was just being paranoid.

I’ve done some research myself and I know a bit about it from my pharmacy student ex who took Truvada, but I’d like some more info. I know that I can’t take NSAIDs while on Truvada due to potential issues with kidney function. I also know that I need to get STD tests done at least every three months and that it’s critical to take it every single day at roughly the same time. Is there anything else that I need to avoid/do? Is it safe to drink alcohol? I’ll put it this way, I’m a college student in a frat so I drink more than a bit and I’m not sure I want to sacrifice that for PrEP.

About an hour after taking my first dose last night I felt nauseated and somewhat lightheaded for about 30 minutes. I’ve also had a killer headache for the past few hours. Is this normal? Can I expect it to stop happening after a week or two? I’ve read that it can cause pretty bad diarrhea - has anyone had experience with this? My stomach already hates me most days, so I’m really hoping that it’s only a temporary thing, if I experience it at all.

Obviously if I was actively looking to hookup with other men PrEP would be a no brainier, given that in combination with condoms the risk of HIV would be reduced greatly.

However, for the past two years I was in a monogamous relationship in which we both knew our status. There was no need for PrEP at that time. 

Now that I am single again I'm wondering if I should be on it? I have no intention of having casual sex and never really did in the past either. I value a more emotional connection, intimacy, and trust before having sex with a partner. 

That being said, if by chance, I find myself one day wanting to sleep with other men but not have anal sex (just oral for example) would PrEP be indicated? Or if I decided to have protected anal sex once in a blue moon would PrEP be indicated? 

Also, even if I do find another potential partner should I be on PrEP in case he is sleeping around/cheating/ect....? 

In the perfect would I would find another monogamous boyfriend before having sex again, but those are hard to find these days."

So I am currently 21 years old and I have never had sex of any kind. I live in Canada and PrEP is currently covered by provincial healthcare in a few provinces but mine hasn't covered it yet and neither of my insurance plans cover it unfortunately. As a result, I would be ordering it online until my province (hopefully) covers it. I have an appointment with my doctor on Monday so I'll ask her what she thinks about it then as well but I was hoping to get some opinions and feedback beforehand.

As I mentioned, I am not and never have been sexually active but at some point I will be. I don't intend on hooking up or doing the casual sex thing and I don't think I would have sex with anybody without them getting tested first. I'm only interested in a monogamous relationship and I know a lot of people stop using condoms or PrEP once in a monogamous relationship but I am naturally not an overly trusting person and cheating happens so I don't know if I would feel comfortable ditching the condoms even in an LTR.

My questions:

1. Is it safe to order PrEP online? I know sites like www.iwantprepnow.co.uk advocate ordering it online if you don't have access or can't afford it but has anybody done this and has it worked out fine? I'm worried about the drugs potentially being fake(if that is a thing that happens?).

2. How common are side effects? I'm most concerned about kidney or liver problems but I am most concerned about lipodystrophy since the kidney problems are from what I have read reversible once you stop taking it. I haven't been able to find many studies on lipodystrophy when taking Truvada and the few that do talk about only examine HIV+ people. and they are usually taking another drug as well. I read that the FDA and EMA took the warning label for this side effect off earlier this year because they haven't found evidence proving it but a lot of sources say different things so I don't know what to believe.

3. Is it something you can or should take for the rest of you life? 

4. Considering everything I have said, would you recommend PrEP for someone like me(assuming I don't have anything pre-existing health condition that would make PrEP risky)?

It's non-stop discharge from the anus, so I have to sleep with tissue in my boxers. Serious inflammation in my sphincter, causing it to be ridiculously tight, making bowel movements torture (feels like having a baby that's covered in broken shards of glass that's been doused  in hot chilli sauce). There are red ulcers all around my anus. Sleep can be uncomfortable because symptoms cause serious sweating. You wake up and you're whole bed sheets, pillow and duvet are soaked. Even after a few days on antibiotics I can be woken up in the middle of the night by painful itching caused by the discharge. Honestly it's a fucking travesty down there. Sitting is always uncomfortable, but improves daily when taking antibiotics.

The treatment is 3 weeks of antibiotics rather than the usual 7 days.

This strain of chlamydia is most often seen in MSM and is generally diagnosed in the anus. 

I don't know how common it is in the USA, but in Europe, the U.K. especially it increasing.

Before I started on the antibiotics it was 2 days of tortuous itching and stabbing pain. I literally told myself if I didn't get antibiotics by the weekend I would kill myself. The itching drives you insane, literally!

And I'm suffering all this because I chose minutes of extra pleasure for potentially days to weeks of pain and discomfort.

Every step I take towards actually going out with this guy **feels** right and makes me happy but I get the thoughts of ""this is unnatural, your sick"" etc. I don't believe those thoughts, just they're going through my mind so much after hearing it so often.

Just wanted to spread the word that PrEP has been added to the PBS (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) as of the 1st April.

You no longer have to join a medical trial or import it from overseas! 

A friend of mine was diagnosed with HIV at the beginning of this year, so it's still very much something that all gay guys still need to be conscious of. Don't think that it could never happen to you, protect yourself guys! The more people that get on PrEP, the more likely that this could hopefully be the beginning of the end of HIV transmission in Australia!

I always use condoms for anal, for oral I finish people off by hand rather than spitting or swallowing until I've seen recent test results. I don't engage in risky sex and I avoid hard drug users.

I enumerated all of this to the doc and she said simply ""having sex with men who have sex with men"" was enough of a risk factor. When I asked about side effects she seemed to downplay things a lot and said ""some GI discomfort"" would be the only one, and claimed there would be no long term side effects what so ever beyond ""some bone density issues"". Wtf? That sounds like an issue, and she didn't mention it until I pressed her about side effects, which makes me uncomfortable.

I guess what it boils down to is that I felt like I was being pitched a product instead of given medical advice, and that makes me uncomfortable.

This is therefore kind of a catch\-22. I can only ever get off PREP via swearing off sex entirely and becoming celibate, or magically finding someone who would be okay with a closed relationship. It feels frustrating, and I feel like I'm stuck taking this pill.

I know this is not a rational/proportional fear, since the risk is quite low when using condoms, but eh, some people are afraid of flying, or spiders, so whatever. This makes it hard to get to know new people and dates, or a boyfriend, since I'm usually quite awkward and/or prude in bed until I trust the person really well, e.g. I would not do blowjobs without a condom and in general be a bit tense and stressed out - not something that makes for good sex, or leaves a good impression on a date.

That said, recently, affordable PrEP has been introduced and approved in my country - costing around 70€ monthly. I thought that might lower the risk, especially in conjunction with condoms, and make sex with people I don't really know yet as enjoyable for me as it seems to be for the vast majority of the rest of the gay community :)

 However, I've read about dizziness or headache as a side effect, and even kidney and bone damage. Since PrEP is not paid for by the public health insurance, I can't really ask my doctor about it because he probably doesn't have any other PrEP patients (it's not common here) and I would need to pay for any advice, examination etc. related to PrEP out of my own pocket.

Just to set the demographics: I'm a full-time, salaried designer in my mid-twenties with a job I like for a very large agricultural engineering and tech company in the Midwest. Should have some pretty good health insurance right? Hmm, not exactly. Like [thousands of other employers](https://capturebilling.com/infographic-high-deductible-health-plans/) over the last few years my company only offers high deductible health plans (""consumer-driven health plans"" in bullshit corporate-politic speak). [These plans are complicated, opaque and difficult to budget for if you're not making well above the median salary for your area](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-06-26/sky-high-deductibles-broke-the-u-s-health-insurance-system) and willing to sit down and critically evaluate all your health spending and know how to perform basic budgeting and accounting ([most people are not good at this](http://time.com/3657285/task-americans-cant-do/)). My employer-sponsored HDHP insurance is provided by UnitedHealthcare (UHC), a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group (UHG), [the largest health""care"" company in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnitedHealth_Group). My deductible is $2,400 with a max-out-of-pocket of $3,300. My premiums are pretty cheap though, which is the supposed to be what is attractive about these plans; about $46 a month ($552/year). Legislators (primarily conservative) and the insurance companies defend these plans as cost-effective for primarily younger and healthy people like me.

I consulted with my primary care practitioner in April after I realized I was experimenting more with non-monogamous bottoming and the statistics very plainly spell out that receiving is by far the highest risk activity for HIV infection (not to downplay that most forms of sexual intercourse is an opportunity for transmission). The doctor was more than understanding why I was asking for Truvada and was incredibly easy to work with to get the proper testing and Rx written. Now imagine my frustration and feelings of hopelessness when I started Googling the Gilead Advancing Access program along with my health plan and started finding articles likes [this](https://pozlawyer.com/2017/11/02/warning-your-copay-assistance-card-may-not-count-toward-your-deductible/) where UHC put in place a new policy which does not count prescriptions paid for via manufacturer coupons towards your deductible. For several weeks I couldn't make heads or tails what was going to happen when I walked up to the pharmacy counter and asked for my prescription. Was I going to be charged $1,633.74 or was it going to be covered? What about my 10&amp;#37; co-insurance, could be $163? Will the coupon contribute to my deductible? How does OptumRx, the pharmaceutical benefits management arm of UHG, classify Truvada? Lots of questions that took hours of searching because none of these niche cases are spelled out anywhere in our health plans. **And yes, unfortunately, HIV prevention is a niche health service to most insurance companies because it is only most prevalent in non-monogamous, primarily male, homosexual healthcare needs which are probably less than 4\% of their subscribers. It is not prevalent in heterosexual healthcare needs so it is not a large focus. HIV prevention is only a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of all the therapies and procedures an insurance company negotiates and covers.** [If you need evidence just look at how UHC denied coverage to a gay man trying to obtain Truvada a couple years ago](http://www.losangelesblade.com/2017/08/03/unitedhealthcare-denied-prep-coverage-gay-man-high-risk-homosexual-behavior/) and lost in court when sued for this denial of coverage. Most health insurance does not consider HIV prevention a priority or preventative service.

After making a couple calls to my plan I was told that I was going to have to pay for the full cost of Truvada until I satisfied my $2,400 deductible, at which point I would only have to pay a 10&amp;#37; co-insurance until I reached my $3,300 max, at which point I would not have to pay anymore for prescriptions and healthcare and insurance pays it all. After running the numbers I realized that I was not going to be able to use the Gilead coupon on my first prescription fulfillment because the coupon is maxed at $4,800/year for assistance. If I charged the first, full-price prescription to the coupon that would eat up 34&amp;#37; of my annual max for only a month supply of the drug AND it would not contribute to my deductible due to UHC's hostile policy towards manufacturer coupons. If I kept charging each prescription to the coupon I would chew up the annual max assistance in 3 months, and then I would have to pay for one month out of my pocket (month 4), which would satisfy my deductible. After month 4 I would then pay the 10&amp;#37; co-insurance of $163 for the remaining months in the year until my deductible resets in January and it starts all over (this is assuming that I receive care for $800 worth of other, unrelated issues which also continue to contribute to my deductible). This is a terrible plan.

The smartest way to go about this with my plan, was to pay for the first prescription entirely out of my pocket which would then apply the $1,633.74 to my deductible. I had about $500 already applied to my deductible from previous clinic visits and care provided for unrelated issues. This put me at $300 short of my deductible in May and meant that if I did not add any more charges to my deductible it wouldn't matter, because each time I would charge subsequent Truvada prescriptions to the coupon they would be charge the remainder of my deductible (\~$300) plus the 10&amp;#37; of the cost of the drug minus the outstanding deductible. This allows me to charge all my subsequent Truvada prescriptions for the rest of the year to the coupon because that sum of those amounts would be &lt;$4800/year which keeps me under the coupons max coverage.

When I went to the pharmacy to purchase the first prescription and then checked my deductible after the claim was made it played out exactly as I had expected and planned. So far this year I have maxed out my deductible. I've actually paid $2,800 out of pocket for healthcare this year. About $1,800 of that is for Truvada. How do I justify this? It requires a shift in how you think about it. I see it as paying \~$150/month when you divide out the cost over the entire year. This makes it a little easier to digest the cost I'm being saddled with in these ""consumer-driven plans"". Let's not forget about those premiums though. All said and done, that when averaged out, I will pay $280/month out of my own pocket for healthcare. This isn't a terrible amount-- but the mental and accounting gymnastics I had to go through to make this as cheap as possible is simply unacceptable. I have a feeling not everybody would have been motivated enough to investigate this and would have simply given up getting Truvada, and that's the tragedy in this story. I also felt alienated by insurance throughout this entire process and I think that would drive a lot of people to stop pursuing the drug as well.

Just to clear the muddy waters of American healthcare, it should be said that our doctors, nurses, and clinics and other *healthcare providers* are not an issue. They're capable, most will listen to their patients and they want to help you stay healthy. *Health insurance companies* do not care about your health. They are not connected to providers in most situations. They are separate companies which do little else other than be opaque middlemen between the patient and provider who handle the transaction of money and claims. That's it. They do not see you as a patient. You aren't even a customer to them; that's your employer who negotiated a plan agreement with the company. You are a consumer of services and capital to a health insurance company and they find you very annoying for this reason because you cost them money when you decide to get sick and are so selfish that you go an see a doctor (/s) or follow [CDC recommendations for preventative healthcare](https://www.advocate.com/health/2014/05/15/cdc-recommends-truvada-hiv-prevention). Incoming, but related rant: health insurance is not your doctor, they aren't your health coach and they are not your friend. It's a contract of business and they will not go outside those terms to save your life or live as healthy as possible."

Well, Gonorrhea, Herpes, Syphilis, HPV, Hepatitis can all be transmitted via unprotected oral sex and while very very rare, so can HIV. 

Also, studies by CDC show that PrEP is more effective in preventing HIV transmission in MSM than condoms.

So the way I see it, if you think barebacking on PrEP is a terrible idea and guys are stupid for doing, but you dont use condoms for oral sex.  Where is your leg to stand on?

8zgg50,"I finally gotten life &amp; long term disability insurance being on PrEP! However, it was a hard journey.",https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/8zgg50/i_finally_gotten_life_long_term_disability/,IncendiaryGames,1,7/16/2018 17:28,0,/r/askgaybros/comments/8zgg50/i_finally_gotten_life_long_term_disability/,NaN,"Background: I've been on Truvada for PrEP since 2015. In 2016 I applied before and got a long term disability (LTD) insurance policy with Mutual of Omaha in the State of California. They denied it initially. I got Lambda Legal represented me and we reached a settlement where they issued a policy with a ""HIV/AIDs exclusion."" 

Fast forward in 2017 I lost a lot of weight but was now living in Nevada. I decided to apply again for better rates but got declined again for PrEP. I didn't decide to pursue it at this time. 

Now in 2018 I got a new job, lost even more weight, and moved back to California. After reading these two articles I decided to apply for long term disability insurance and life insurance again:    
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/health/truvada-hiv-insurance.html     
http://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2018/statement018-18.cfm     

I'm reporting mixed success. I've applied with Pacific Life for life insurance,
Principal for Long Term Disability ""Retirement Contribution Protection"" insurance, and The Standard for a regular Long Term Disability insurance policy. I had a fluke urine test showing high protein in the urine that was a result of exercising before the test. On retesting that went away. Pacific Life and Principal issued policies for me at the premium I was quoted at with no exclusions. :D

Unfortunately, The Standard is playing hard and is absolutely refusing to reconsider the fluke urine test. :( It's not an outright decline but they made the policy the absolute worst it can be for someone, only giving coverage for 2 years at a 100% premium hike and dropping all riders. My policy with Principal was at their best rates, to age 65, all the riders, etc. My insurance agent is telling me it's ridiculous that he's never seen them do this with anyone else. We're pretty sure that I would be reconsidered if I wasn't on PrEP and that they're stretching for ANY reason to deny/rate unfavorably. 

I'm fighting tooth and nail for it as The Standard in general has a stronger and better policy that fits my needs better. Even though they're not citing PrEP in their denial it's clear from my and my agent's perspective that discrimination is happening, just internally. It makes no sense to him that I have gotten two other policies at the best possible rates and for The Standard to treat me like I'm at death's door. 

So, in 2018, it's definitely gotten better! My advice to you if you're looking for life or disability insurance, if you're not on PrEP, strongly consider getting a policy first then getting on PrEP if possible. Then, if you are on PrEP, I highly recommend finding a great independent agent and writing a cover letter explaining PrEP, possibly citing the New York Times and California Dept. of Insurance links. 

Be prepared for it to take a long time. I applied back in March and I just today got the life insurance policy. My LTD policy is in the mail as we speak. This is new waters for the insurance world. "

I saw both figures so I'm not sure which, but I've also read about Gilead's copay assistance program so regardless it looks like I likely wouldn't have to pay anything for pharmaceutical.

My issue is seeing someone that I can talk to about possibly going on and prescribing PrEP. I don't have a primary care doctor that I could talk to, but I found a database that has doctors that take my dad's insurance. I don't know if I can go to any of them or if I should be looking for specific doctors that might work with stuff like this.

A few days later he messages me back basically to tell me that if I'm being safe with partners, that PrEP really isn't necessary for me and that I should just stick with condoms. He also said to me that if I did want to take it I would need ""additional lab testing beforehand"" (which I've never heard of before?) I remind him that I'd like the added assurance of being on Prep as not everyone is truthful about their status and condoms aren't always effective. 

Well, a week later and he finally messages me back explaining that he discussed this with colleagues, and has to place an electronic consult to Infectious Disease about this before he can prescribe me the medication. 

Is this supposed to be this difficult? Why would a consult like this be necessary? And why would I need additional lab testing before they know if I'm eligible to take this medication?

Now you can take 2 doses 24-2 hours before your sexual encounter and one pill 24 hours later and then a second pill 24 hours after that.

I then called Gilead. They said I can have my doctor fill out a financial hardship form requesting free Truvada blah blah.

My name is Jorge Alcantar, and I'm a doctoral student in adult clinical psychology at the Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology of Yeshiva University. I am recruiting participants for my research study about gay men living in New York City who have considered **and/or** are currently using Truvada for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). 

Participation in the study involves a 30-60 minute conversation (in person, over the phone or on Skype) about your thoughts on PrEP. Please contact me if you're interested in participating or have any questions, and feel free to pass this information along to other guys whom you think might be interested in participating. We are hoping that this study will help us better understand what factors are important to gay men when they decide whether to take PrEP. 

The criteria to participate are:

* being a self-identified gay male
* living in New York City
* 18 years of age or older
* sexually active in the past six months
* having awareness of Truvada for PREP (being on PrEP is **not** necessary to participate in this study)

If you would like to participate, please contact me at [jalcanta@mail.yu.edu](mailto:jalcanta@mail.yu.edu). This research project is supervised by Dr. Shelly Goldklank ([sgoldklank@mindspring.com](mailto:sgoldklank@mindspring.com)) under the auspices of the Internal Review Board (IRB) of the Albert Einstein School of Medicine (Einstein IRB # 2016-6444).

I believe he is supportive, in his own way but it can be hard not to feel that he's dating me only because to him my diagnosis is the most interesting thing about me. He's not a bug chaser, but he certainly gets a thrill out of it. This is perhaps unfair towards him and the support he has offered to me over the months but he's the one who suggested and insisted on having sex without condoms the moment we started dating. I have mistaken his recklessness and his care-free attitude for support and acceptance. This now more than ever proves to me how much our personalities are incompatible. 

However although their relationship is still early (9 months) I do believe it's salvageable through counseling or anything else. As much as his carefree attitude bothers me, it has helped me too."

I used to get pretty bad tonsillitis multiple (8+) times a year, finally made the decision at 25 to get them out.

Went through a GP, to my specialist and surgeon, All was going well.

Had to do some pre-op interviews and information things with a nurse who was lovely and then had to have another doctor sign off on her notes.

Now I will admit, English wasn’t his first language but I could tell that when I explained why I was taking PREP to him that it hadn’t clicked, so I made it abundantly clear that it was an anti retroviral, for prevention only, etc. thought I’d finally gotten through to him, he went to google PREP. I clarified some more; he tells me I can keep taking it during the surgery and recovery and I think it’s finally all making sense to him.

Apparently not, get a fairly urgent call from my specialist/surgeon’s office regarding one last checkup that I’d need before the surgery, wasn’t something they had booked with me prior so was a bit of a surprise as were about a week away from the surgical date, and I’m out of pocket $100-$200 with each visit to her.

I get to her office, wait an hour or so as you do for specialists, at least in Australia. Finally get in and I can tell something is up, she’s sorta stepping on eggshells and wanting to make sure I’m aware of all these additional risks with surgery and recovery; risks she hasn’t mentioned at prior visits and that weren’t listed on the multitude of pamphlets and collateral they had dumped on me.

It’s only at her use of the words ‘due to your status’ that I’ve finally put two and two together and realized that doctor from the interview has mistakenly told my surgeon that I’m HIV positive. I’ve clarified with her and she was apologetic I’ve reiterated what I’m taking and why, she’s told me it’s fine to continue taking but the tablets might be rough on the tonsil scars.

Now don’t get me wrong, not expecting every doctor to be perfect, but this guy must’ve been really obtuse. I can’t stress enough how many different ways I tried to explain it to him, he even left the interview for a period to go and look it up, he came back and I again reiterated.

All in all it was $170 for the additional specialist visit, I put in a complaint about the interviewing doctor, not sure it did much; did make me feel a bit better.

I am looking for some advice regarding PreP. Basically, I want to start exploring my sexuality more. I am 27 years old and I have honestly not done all that much with a guy.  I am at a point where I would really like to try more things with possibly more than one partner. I would practice safer sex regardless to prevent STDs/HIV, but I know that PreP would protect me from an accidental exposure that could possibly occur.  Part of what has been holding me back from trying more things out sexually is the fear contracting STDs and in particular, HIV. However, I know that going on a long-term medication like PreP can have side-effects, so I am conflicted. Do you think PreP is worth looking into further? Or would I just be okay with practicing safer sex (condoms, etc)?

Incident 1) - Condom broke, he cummed inside me

Incident 2) - Scumbag top deliberately removed condom halfway through during doggy where I couldn't see

But these two seperate incidents I found weren't easy to cope with. It was still a month each of stress. I was discussing with my kind nurse - condoms don't deal with the risk when they break or when some arsehole decides to take it off. That stresses me, having experienced both. So she prescribed me PREP, the same drug as the PEP, as I didn't suffer a single side effect, explained the cost, how to use, acknowledging this and that, and now I have it for $22 a month.

I'm 20 days into Prep, I've updated my Grindr HIV status to Negative on Prep, and lord, I've had an increase in messages - but also, a significant number of (attractive) boys who want to fuck raw and will refuse to do so with a condom.

I've maintained my tough stance against unprotected sex. So many conversations that go  ""we should fuck raw ;) come on man....theres no risk...fine im not interested"".

The drug is still undergoing a public trial in England (PrEP IMPACT trial https://www.prepimpacttrial.org.uk). PrEP is only prescribed in sexual health/GUM clinics here and not available from GP's like in the US.

However, doctors will usually only prescribe PrEP to people who have had bareback sex with at least 2 partners in the last 3 months and are likely to do so again. This is a clear contrast to the US, where the FDA has only approved PrEP for use WITH condoms. It will be interesting to see how many people who are denied PrEP by the NHS for not barebacking, later go on to catch HIV. Obviously money is tight so they only prescribe the drugs to those most at risk. Is this somehow rewarding risky behaviour and punishing those who wish to take PrEP as an extra precaution (condoms can still brake/stealthing can happen)? Some people may think so, some people may not.

Have any guys in the UK been denied PrEP on the NHS? Should PrEP only be prescribed to those who bareback? Perhaps the NHS could offer to prescribe PrEP privately to those who aren't eligible but would like to self-fund the drugs. Generic versions of PrEP can be bought cheaply online and imported from abroad (see https://www.iwantprepnow.co.uk), but you have to send a copy of your passport to these companies.

I got on PREP 3 weeks ago (and have religously made sure I take my pill each day) because HIV just gives me too much anxiety and my nurse could see that so prescribed it to me.

I had a hookup with another guy tonight. He’s really passionate, im feeling the chemistry and all. He’s rimming me, legit making me weak with pleasure and he says he’d love to fuck me. I say I’d like that too. So I’m on my stomach he’s on top after rimming me and he starts to slide in with his thick 8” tool. He didn’t apply lube - just a lot of rimming.

Ok first of all can I say, it definitely feels different to vs with condom. There was no friction or stinging. It felt more “natural”. It just feels so intimate knowing you’re having “natural” sex; complete skin to skin contact.

Anyways after he slipped his head in I had second thoughts and said hey let’s stop for a sec and after he pulled out and I jerked myself a bit, i cummed because the feeling was way too intense. He said he got on PREP ages ago but respected if I wanted to use a condom.

Got home an hour later and just jerked myself off and already cummed again to the idea of him inside me bare.

My understanding is that, given that I have been taking PEP for 7+ days, I am effectively on PrEP right now, and therefore, even if I have sex today, I will be ok to stop taking PEP on day 28 after the first sexual encounter.

For what it's worth, I do wear condoms while also on daily Truvada. The only time I drop the condom is if I'm only being with one person and I know he's on Truvada as well and has been tested. For me, the main benefit is the mental health. As someone who has seen therapists for hypochondria, the double protection does a wonder for my state of mind.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, I always see listed in medical handouts, online material, and reddit posts here is that one main reason to continue using condoms is because it doesn't prevent you from other STIs. However, most gay men are still very likely to pick up the other STIs if they include oral sex as part of their sex life. And I feel like oral sex is just as if not more common as anal sex. It doesn't require a partner to feel confident that they can bottom that night. Last year, I had gonorrhea twice while never having sex without a condom. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that condoms are still suggested because there is one reported case of a person getting HIV while on Truvada and in case you forgot to take some of your pills but didn't realize it. These are two good reasons. I wish these were cited more instead of playing off fear of other STIs which are still going to happen unless you cut out oral sex. "

Hi I hope this is the right place for this post... but i believe us gay men need to have an honest conversation about prep.

Recently I've got back on dating apps and i kid you not that probably 8/10 if not 9/10 men claim to be on prep. To make it worse most of these men refuse to wear condoms and even state in their profiles bareback only. 

I honestly find it hard to believe that all these men are using prep. And even if so, just like with women's birth control they let you know that there is still that 1% chance meaning this is not 100% gonna prevent HIV. So why are so many men now a days claiming to be on prep and refusing to do anything besides bareback?

You can stop here and leave any input you would like, if you agree, disagree, or just have something to say about the situation.  Honestly I feel like this is harming our community as no one cares about their health anymore. Prep helps prevent HIV but there are still many diseases we should be worried about, and our community should be more honest and educated. Like I said you can stop here and reply below I'm gonna list some red flags that I've recently seen, as I don't want this post too long. 

1. A couple years ago when I asked my doctor for prep, they denied me and said it was for people who are in close contact with the disease.  I.e. nurses, health professionals,  or maybe if you are dating someone with HIV. (They did not say only them but they gave me this reason for denial). This leads me to believe that it is not that easily accessible to anyone who asks. 

2. The refusal to use condoms period.. I don't understand.  If someone is fine without them ok, but there are many who refuses to use them period. 

3. There has been 3 guys in the last month who wrote me on dating apps. They all have sent nudes, we've talked sexually, and talked about linking up. But soon as I mentioned the use of condoms... they claim that they aren't looking for sex. Yet I have 3 dick pics from you, your profile only talks about hooking up and describing it in detail but when condoms are brought up the conversation stops? Make this shit make sense lol



TD:LR

9/10 men claim to be on prep and refuse to use condoms?

Do you believe them? Are you on prep?

I find it hard to believe such a high percentage of men are using prep, and that this is destroying our community. 

Even if they are on prep, this prevents HIV. What about the other diseases?  Thoughts? 

If you are a gay man you should be committing on this post."

* **Is there anything to be concerned about?** 
* **Has anyone here suffered from any side effects?** 
* **If so, how'd you resolve the issue? (lower the dosage? stopped it?)**

I use a douche to prep before anal masturbation, but it seems like every time I think I'm finally done a little bit of fecal matter comes out. After about an hour or so of trying to clean I just get frustrated and go play anyway. Am I doing something wrong, or do I just need to learn to be more patient?

I've ready so many posts and articles... I just don't know. 

I mean I'm just as worried about contracting HIV but I've been reading reading studies where they say they do not know the long-term effects of PrEP... that it causes bone density issues up to 1.8% :S.... and also fat redistribution... that it gives you nightmares and makes you throw up for 2 weeks.... all these things weird me out... 

I'm just worried I'll fuck myself over doing something to prevent something that may never happen. I know a lot of people say it's OK but it really concerns me there are no long term studies...  so how does everyone know that it's fine? 

I'm currently only sleeping with one guy who takes PrEP himself. So I dunno... Argh... I don't know what to do... 

Can anyone ELI5? Maybe ease my mind about this, explain how it all works. I know i'll have to get tested and then every six months? I get my blood work done so they'll know it something bad is going on?"

Been sussing around on reddit for a while and need some advice about PrEP, as I’m confused or most likely concerned about my body’s reaction to it. About two weeks ago I started it (Truvada) and I have been having bad reactions constant abdominal pains, itchiness (even hives developing on localised parts of my body) almost as if I’m allergic. I was told of slight side effects but nothing this bad. Tonight is the first time I have skipped it and all my reactions have seemed to stop. 

My doctor (GP) had all my blood, liver and kidney tested before starting it and everything was fine. So should I stop taking it and go back to check if I’m allergic or did anyone else have the same reaction and just waited it out?

I’m really not sure if I do need it but I have just got it as an extra layer of protection as I still am using protection 80% of the time.

Any suggestions or actual experiences would be greatly appreciated, hope you are all doing well :)"

I'll just start out saying that I'm on PReP. I'm a pretty severe hypochondriac, and I can't help but feel like I'm gonna be the statistic that caught HIV while on PReP. I had condomless sex (I was the insertive partner) with a complete stranger about a month ago. He said he was HIV negative (and not on PReP), but who really knows. Two weeks later I started to develop flu-like symptoms, such as a fever, loss of appetite, achy muscles and joints, loose stool, and a sore throat. That lasted for about 4 days, the symptoms subsided, but then came back again about a week later. I was super concerned I was seroconverting because none of my friends were sick and I had to my knowledge not been in contact with sick people (people have started getting sick with strep within the past week though, which has made me feel better, in a strange way).

 I went to the doctor for my sore throat, she said that I had strep and sent me off with some antibiotics. I told the doctor my concerns about contracting HIV on PReP, and she just laughed at me. After the appointment I could not shake the idea that I contracted HIV. I noticed a little wart on my penis the following day, and went to Planned Parenthood, where they removed it and told me I had HPV. I mentioned to the nurse there that I was concerned about seroconversion and contracting HIV, and she said that it was a definite possibility and recommended that I get an HIV rapid test. I did the test and it came back negative, but I have also heard that HIV rapid tests are only conclusive at the 3-month post-exposure marker and it has only been 1 month. 

I started taking PReP to ease my anxiety, and it obviously isn't helping. I feel like a fucking crazy person. Should I be worried, or should I just shut the hell up?

Still not very accessible (Italy is very bureaucratic) and kind of expensive for me (60 euros for 30 pills) to take it on a daily basis. The doctor said I can take it ""on demand"": two pills 24-2 hours before sex + two pills 24 and 48 hours later respectively. Besides, I don't have risky sex a lot (let's say, two or three times a month, condomless with a guy I trust and we got tested, I also go to saunas a few times where I wear condoms, but they sometimes break)... I don't plan my encounters either... they just happen (last time, the guy just called and he was fucking me after 15 min). I'm also afraid to put all those chemicals into my body every day, and I can't afford it as a regular expense either.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions:

1-  How effective is it if I take Prep immediately after exposure or a couple of minutes before? (I tried to search, but couldn't find any information).

2 - The bottle says the expiry date is 30 days after I open it. Does that mean the pills will lose effect after that time? In that case, it would be useless to take it ""on demand"" just on exposures to save money, right?"

Sure, PrEP is a huge accomplishment in the fight against HIV/AIDS, and could even lead to its extintion. However, when its use is becoming more and more widespread on gay communities in the USA and Europe, (not very bright) people are beginning to think that they no longer need condoms when having sex, ignoring other STDs like gonorrhea, syphilis and herpes, which of course PrEP doesn't stop.

In my opinion, if PrEP becomes more widespread and easily accesible, this could lead to a decline in condom use, and logically a rise in bareback and unprotected sex, which could leave us very vulnerable to new STDs and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, in a situation very similar to the late 70s. Maybe I am being dramatic and exagerated, but this could even lead to a new AIDS-like epidemic.

My point is that PrEP may be detrimental to the safe sex ideology that thrived in the aftermath of the genocidal AIDS epidemic. I would love to hear your opinions on this and other points of view."

I've been on prep for about 7 months now, I didn't really have any side effects except headaches for a few days and an upset stomach but totally manageable. However, even after my upset stomach went away, I've really never been able to get my body back to normal in terms of too soft stool. I've tried just about any combination of diet changes and fiber intake but I can't really get things back to normal. Before prep, I always had consistent and clean/normal bathroom trips. Since then, it's been nearly impossible to keep things clean on the inside which means I haven't been able to bottom really. I've done it a few times but even with douching I'm still too nervous to fully relax and enjoy it because I've had a few accidents which never used to happen.  


Has anyone had the same on-going issue? Is there anything that could help other than dietary and fiber changes? I'm going to see my doctor next week and plan to bring it up, but if there are any medications someone else has used I'd like to know so I can bring it up with her.

I just moved, so I’m trying out new doctors. I also went to Planned Parenthood to start Truvada, since the person I am dating has HIV. While PP did tell me I was at lower risk (0 anal sex partners in the last 6 months, and I have sex only in monogamous relationships), they wrote a prescription.

Here’s the kicker: my liver’s AST enzymes were slightly elevated at baseline (suggesting possible damage). The prescriber said it would be fine to take the pill because it’ll be monitored anyway.

My new primary care doctor also noticed this, and wants me not to take Truvada for 6 weeks, because he wants to see what my liver enzyme level will be without it. He has also asked me if I have HIV three times across 2 appointments. I told him I’ve started seeing someone who is HIV+, and he says sex with a condom and/or refraining from anal sex for the next month should be fine. 

I’m not sure whose advice to take here and which risk is greater, but I’m wondering if anyone else has had elevated enzymes or liver issues. I’d also just like a second opinion on whose advice I should follow. I don’t want to end up tanking my liver, but I also don’t want to have an increased risk of infection if I become intimate with this guy in he next month."

Anyway so I'm on prep now. And I hooked up with a guy and he was fine with topping me bare, which we did and it was hot. But when he bottomed he wanted me to use a condom, which is fine also. 

But I'm just wondering what about you, would you bottom or top bare for someone on prep? Would you be willing to top but not bottom, or just use condoms anyway and prep is just in case a condom breaks?

And do you see someone who requires prep as more dangerous to sleep with because they must be having a lot of sex?"

I am a very responsible guy and I wear protection at all times and get tested regularly. I haven't felt secondary effects so far. I want to ask you guys out there if anyone is taking this modality of PreP, and what do you do when you miss a dose. I take mine every day at 5 pm but a couple of times I have forgotten leading to taking the pill at 8-9pm. My concern is, these couple of times that I have forgotten but taken the doses anyway, will it affect my level of protection, since I do not take it every day but under the Ts and Ss modality?

I’m gay! I try to understand about the gay world perhaps as much as you do. The only goal of this survey is to make us share an honest and mature frame of our universe. So if you please could give your contribution. 

I’m very curious to know your opinions. You could also comment here. Some points:

* 1 - How safe do you think it is to take Prep and have bareback sex with strangers?
* 2 - A number of guys have licked my ass after fucking me or after inserting fingers. Although there was no visible shit, there sure was some, that’s some light form of scat. What do you think of scat?
* 3 - Do you personally believe the ideal form of relationship is open, you can have sex with whomever you want? Or is it better to have a closed monogamous relationship?
* 4 - The LGBT movement often promotes events where gays have easy access to parties, sex, drugs and orgies, pushing them to a hedonistic, individualistic and self-destructive lifestyle. Instead, it should concentrate on creating a social structure to stop marginalizing gays, include them in society by encouraging them to have steady partners, get married and build families. Do you agree?"

I take prep on demand and not daily. I took my first dose (2 pills) 8 hours before having sex. I took my second dose (1 pill) 27 hours after the first dose (3 hours later) and I took my third dose (1 pill) 57 hours after the first dose.

I had unprotected sex and was the bottom. I really liked the guy and therefore was easily convinced when he asked me to not use a condom and promised that he would pull out. Although he broke his promise and ejaculated in me in the end. When later asked, he told me that I knew that he was HIV- negative and that he liked me and that he took PrEP and proceeded to show me his pills.

I know that I've made a mistake by not taking PrEP correctly but I'm not used to take pills, I was stressed and simply forgot because of the workload that I had and my classes. I know that it's foolish but I still somehow trust the guy because he told me not to worry when I told him that I didn't take PrEP correctly. 

How likely is it that I've contracted HIV? Should I inform my doctor and go on PEP? Am I letting my feelings cloud my judgement?

I've reached a point in my life where I'm not hooking up anymore.  The next time I sleep with someone I want it to be an act of live (or at least, affection) with someone who I feel has romantic potential.  

When I take my pill in the morning, it always makes me feel strange - like I think I have no business taking it if I'm not going to truck stop glory holes and meeting tricks from grindr every night.

I've officially slowed down.  I have no plans to be sexual with anyone but myself for the forseeable future.  However, if one of my favorite FWB's asked if they could come over, I probably won't say no.

I'm thinking of staying on prep for the extra protection, because I get it for free and I have no side effects.  Also, if I do end up dating and finding Mr Right, I don't know his sexual history or if he knows his status.  I know you have to be on prep for a while to build up immunity, so maybe I should stay on for that reason?

On one hand, to me it means sexual liberation when really I'm almost celibate at this point.  On the other hand, the extra protection and having the immunity when I do meet a guy would be really useful, just in case.

I'm using a throwaway so I can give a bit more details. I live in California just for reference. So I'm working a job that has a 70k salary. I like the job a lot it has a ton of great benefits. My health insurance comes from the company. 

I'm a bit worried that PREP is expensive and if my company lays off people (1,000 employees worldwide), they would look at the people who use their health insurance benefit the most. Is that a thing? Can they see what exactly I'm using it for? Either way it seems kinda suspicious that a healthy 26 year old needs 20k a year in prescription drugs. Can HR see what I'm using it on? I believe they go through a 3rd party health insurance provider.

I have the appointment with the doctor this Monday to finally get the prescription, but my worry is that my company would frown upon me spending almost 1/3 of my salary a year in prescription drugs. 

I know what people are going to say.... ""It's your health and well being at stake, no job is worth that much"". Well I struggled  out of college to find a job and this was my first hit after a long string of ""no's"". Plus I love working for my boss, he's great and the workload isn't much at all. 

Also if it matters, I don't do hook ups at all and only have anal with a condom. Though if I was on PREP I would be slightly more open minded to bareback with DATES who said they were clean. Still wouldn't do hook ups with strangers, just doesn't excite me.

I would pay exactly 0 dollars for prep. Not even a co-pay. 

Does anyone that maybe works HR for their company know their policy on this kind of thing?

My ex told me he lost his job at a really nice company because he was new, had PREP as a huge expense, and was a new employee, so he was laid off. No clue if there was merit to that.

Been on PreP for about 3 months and experiencing some appear to be side effects.  What's unusual is that they are occurring after 3 months rather than within the first week or two so not sure if it's related to PreP.

I was at the dentist's office 3 days ago. Had a basic teeth cleaning and laid down on the dentist's chair.  After suddenly getting up, room was spinning very badly, went home and threw up.  Now, three days later, while not as severe, still experience some dizziness especially when laying down flat and staring up at the ceiling or suddenly getting up.

Never had this problem before, no other medical issues or medications used.  Typically take PreP in the morning - and took it before the dentist's appointment.  But what's not making sense is the continuing effects 3 days later and the fact that it's 3 months in.

Any thoughts?"

I’m so numb right now and anxious that in 12 hours I’ll be getting my blood drawn. I’m literally so queasy; as I was driving home I got dizzy and almost had to pull over. Last time I had my blood drawn I almost fainted on top of a six year old while I waited in line to schedule my check up.

I don’t know if PrEP is worth it anymore. I live in the middle of nowhere; there are hardly even any guys here (besides the closeted guys that are cheating on their wives and tweakers, of course.) I don’t even like anal. I hate that everyone here on grindr at my college thinks it’s ok to go bare because of PrEP.

I know it’s always nice to get checked up, but at the same time I don’t know if it’s worth it anymore. Because of PrEP I put myself in riskier situations that I didn’t even enjoy.

I’m having trouble sleeping because of this. Just wanted to vent. Hopefully someone has some advice."

**HIV**  


*PrEP*  

  
* [According to the CDC, HIV transmission is reduced by 99% for guys on PreP.](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/prep.html)

 
* [Out of hundreds of thousands of sex acts over several years, PrEP has only failed in 6 people (one of whom had 60+ partners per month while on cocaine and meth and another who was event based dosing)](https://www.sfaf.org/collections/beta/sixth-case-of-rare-prep-failure-reported-heres-what-to-know/)


*Condoms*


* [According to the CDC, condoms cut the HIV risk for anal sex by 91%](https://www.poz.com/article/condoms-cut-hiv-risk-91-anal-sex-new-cdc-estimate-says)


*Of course, they're 100% if they don't break...and based on the amount of guys who post here freaking out about broken condoms, they do break a lot


**Other STDs***


* Once someone makes the above point, AskGayBros immediately responds by saying: ""WHAT ABOUT OTHER STDS?!? ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANT SYPHILLIS!! HERPES!!""


* Well...do you use condoms for oral? For 99% of you that is a NO.



* Why does this matter?



* [Well, according to the CDC, there is no research to support the notion that oral sex has a lower bacterial STI transmission rate than anal sex - scroll down to the section titled ""Is Oral Sex Safer than Vaginal or Oral Sex""](https://www.cdc.gov/std/healthcomm/stdfact-stdriskandoralsex.htm)



* Granted, HIV does have a drastically lower transmission rate for oral sex.  But, with PrEP, this is no longer a factor (i.e. 99% reduced risk with PrEP compared to 91% with condoms).



**So what happens if a barebacker and an anal-only condom user hook up with a guy who has gonorrhea?**


* Barebacker: oral and genital STD


* Condom user: oral STD



* Overall Result: both guys now have an STD and will receive the same systemic treatment.



**Closing Thoughts**


* AskGayBros...what is the logic I'm missing here? Why is risking an oral STD acceptable, but not a genital STD? 



* I bareback because it feels better and it's hotter - many, but not everyone, agrees...and that's fine! By using a condom for anal but not oral, you have the same risk of STDs as I do barebacking while on PrEP.  If you don't feel comfortable hooking up with me because I bareback, then don't.  Plenty of guys do and I'm happy to just stick with them."

Well, after speaking with my doctor, I canceled it. She was concerned, telling me she could tell I was depressed. After telling her about my anxiety around needles and how I felt PrEP was giving me “permission” to do risky things, we had a conversation. I explained to her how hopeless it felt to be gay, and all what everyone cares about in the gay community is their next hook up. Every gay friend I’ve ever had eventually just saw our relationship as just another way to get more sex. After talking for awhile, she recommended me a therapist, and she scheduled me to see her next week.

I’m relieved to finally have someone to talk to about what’s been on my mind..but at the same time I feel defeated. Even if I don’t have sex for months, I should’ve got tested. I should’ve refilled my prescription. I left the clinic feeling disgusted. It’s been days since I even looked at any apps.

I messaged them via my clinic’s website and they said they allow walk ins. The LGBT portion won’t be open, but I can get blood work done whenever I need. I want to brave enough to just walk in there and do it. But whenever I think about getting my blood drawn, I get queasy. I get so angry at myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I had a consultation with a doctor because I was considering (and now am certain I will be) starting PrEP. Part of the consultation was educational, and he gave me a lot of new information and resources regarding HIV transmission rates, risks, and measures of protection. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of the main resources he showed me is \[this HIV risk estimator\]( [https://wwwn.cdc.gov/hivrisk/estimator.html#-\~mb|rai.stdn.stdp](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/hivrisk/estimator.html#-~mb|rai.stdn.stdp)) from the CDC. If you take anything away form this post, I hope you save this resource for yourself or anyone else who may not be well-educated about the spread of HIV.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the things I wasn't aware of at all, is that having STIs other than HIV - say Chlamydia, which is very common - increases your likelihood of contracting or spreading HIV. 

&amp;#x200B;

The receptive partner in anal sex has approximately a 1.38% chance of contracting HIV if the penetrative partner is HIV+ (not acutely - this is riskier). If one partner has another STI, this likelihood increases to around 3.5-3.7%. If both partners have an STI, which isn't uncommon, the risk increases drastically to more than 10% (the numbers on the tool haven't yet been updated to the most current research, according to my doc). The most serious situation occurs when both have an STI and the penetrative partner has \[acute HIV infection\]( [https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/prep\_gl\_patient\_factsheet\_acute\_hiv\_infection\_english.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/prep_gl_patient_factsheet_acute_hiv_infection_english.pdf) ), which is the early stage of HIV infection when someone is least likely to be aware of their positive status and may not yet even be showing symptoms. The risk in this situations is nearly a 70% chance of contracting HIV, which is terrifying.  Wearing a condom would only decrease your risk of contracting the disease back down to around 20%, whereas PrEP alone decreases the risk to 5.5%. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is all to say, I became a strong convert and advocate for PrEP today. I'd previously held out some skepticism because I thought that PrEP encouraged the spread of non-HIV STIs, and I figured that using a condom would be just as effective in preventing transmission as PrEP is; but it isn't, it's not even close."

Gov Newsom signed a bill yesterday that will allow one to obtain PEP from a pharmacist in California, removing the barrier of needing to first go to an emergency room to obtain a prescription, which can be beneficial, given that it is a time-critical matter (PEP needs to be started within 72 hours of the exposure in question) and this would remove one of the ""steps"" required.

Additionally, they will be able to prescribe a 30-to-60-day course of PrEP without needing a prescription, after which time one would need to obtain a prescription from a healthcare provider. 

It appears that it will only apply to pharmacists who have undergone a special course that trains them to dispense these, and I'm not sure if stores are planning on indicating whether a given location's pharmacy offers PEP and introductory PrEP. Being able to search for a location that for-sure offered PEP might be helpful after a high-risk exposure, so hopefully some method for locating nearby pharmacies that can dispense this will be made available. 

What surprises me about them now being able to offer an introductory PrEP regimen is that it was my understanding that a PrEP prescription requires that the provider test the individual for HIV and also kidney function. With rapid HIV testing, I could see a pharmacist testing an individual for HIV before dispensing PrEP, but testing kidney function seems like it'd require a lab and not something that could be done on the order of minutes. Perhaps, since it's only a 30- or 60-day regimen, they figure that if someone did have impaired kidney function, it wouldn't be a long-enough course to cause major damage before it would be detected by a healthcare provider in the followup appointment? If I get any more info on how they're fulfilling or getting around this, I'll update the post. 

Either way, these options do seem like a great step forward in terms of improving access to these medications. Particularly with the introductory PrEP regimens, if pharmacists had working relationships with physicians in their area who specialize in prescribing it and performing the ongoing testing, it seems like a pharmacist could give an individual their first 30-day supply along with the contact info for a physician's office or clinic they personally recommend and trust for the followup appointments, making the whole process seem less confusing or scary for someone seeking this out for the first time.

https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/dgpt2k/the_raw_unfiltered_thoughts_of_a_day_1_of_hiv/

PrEP is vital to the fight against this HIV/AIDS It can not be made to be seen as a vessel in which wolves wear as sheep's clothing. 

There will be men who tell you they are on PrEP and are not. This is why YOU should be on PrEP. Protect yourself! 

I know this individual is having a difficult time in their relationship and I sympathize. If his boyfriend cheated and infected him that is totally unacceptable. That's what a shitty person does. 

But, this is not a common occurrence. This didn't happen to OP because his boyfriend thought his other relations were on PrEP. This happened because his boyfriend WASN'T. He wanted sex outside of the relationship and didn't want to get caught. Taking PrEP would put his fidelity in question. 


PrEP is a tool to protect YOURSELF not a tool for others to protect you.


TL;DR
PrEP is amazing. It does more to stop new infections  than it could possibly do to create more. OP's situation sucks but it is not PrEP's fault.

My specific questions are the following:

Why is PrEP very wide used in the gay community, even though STD's are as common in heterosexual as in homosexual couples? Is it related to the '80/'90 AIDS explosion in the gay community?

Why its also so recommended in the first place to newcomers? It has a lot of side effects and people in some cases don't seem to say even that it has.

I think PrEP should be known by everyone (male or female, heterosexual or anything you like), but It doesn't need to be recommended to use or to go to a doctor to ask for it if your couple doesn't have STDs, you are having raw sex or you were raped.

Last night was my first time taking PrEP. I took the pill at 9 pm, and braced for the side effects.
By 10 pm I stated feeling slight dizziness as well as discomfort around my occipital lobe. I went to bed around then. Around 1:20 am, I woke up with night sweats, it felt as if the pill had made a hole through my stomach’s mucosal layer, the pain was unbearable. Moreover, I had a pounding headache and more dizziness. It reminded me of the time I tried taking SSRI’s for anxiety, which I discontinued after a day’s use. At that point I developed insomnia, I went through my phone and tried looking up how to flush out this drug from my system fast. I found the half life of Emtricitabine/Tenovofir to be 10-15 hours, so I just started chugging water like a mad man. I told myself I would go to the pharmacy in the morning and return the pills. Why would I want to put myself through this misery everyday? Am I poisoning my body? It took me a lot of research and guts to get on PrEP to start with, but now that I am on it I am truly considering living a life of celibacy. After educating myself on the subject of HIV, the stigma, the community, I have come to value my body more. I haven’t been in a sexual relationship for a month now, no Grinder, no Tinder. To be honest, I no longer feel fulfilled by a simple one night stand as I always end up regretting it. However, I’m sure there will come a day when I engage in sex again; should I battle through the side effects of PrEP to attain that second layer of protection against HIV transmission? I would love to hear your thoughts/experiences.
Cheers"

My problem: I feel like I've forgotten how to prepare for bottoming. I have IBS, which manifests itself with major constipation. I have always taken care of this with some tried and true remedies. Sleep, exercise, good diet, good soluble fiber, lots of water, green and mint tea in the morning, and Metamucil twice a day. This kept me regular.

What am I doing wrong??? Most of my bottoming experiences in the last four years have ended up in some degree of a mess. I feel like I need to douche 10 times just to feel safe, which I don't really have time for. This has seriously affected my desire for sex.

I would’ve never imagined the things I listed in the question are so inaccessible in Italy compared to Brazil (at least in the South of Brazil where I live).

**GET TESTED** \-  In Italy, if I want to get tested for sexual diseases, I need to set an appointment specifically with my family doctor (wait a few days), ask him for the paper request, then go to the hospital at some specific time and wait more days for the result. All that will usually take one or two weeks. **In Brazil, the whole process takes less than one hour!** I just walk into a Test Center any time during business hours, no appointment needed, and have instant results for HIV, hepatitis, syphilis, etc. Fast and free.

There are some places in Italy to get fast and free HIV test only, but with next day results. Alternatively, you can pay a laboratory around 100 euros for a more complete screening and get same day results.

**CONDOMS AND LUBE -** Every neighborhood where I live in Brazil has a small public health center (postinho de saúde) where you can go and fill your pockets with free condoms and lube… they leave near the door, no need to ask, just walk in and take it. In Italy, you pay almost 10 euros for 6 condoms?! Plus 10 euros for lube!

**PREP** \- Brazil is starting to distribute free Prep in capital cities, you need an appointment. Italy is also starting… everything will take at least two weeks: appointment plus exam results, and it costs 70 euros for 30 pills. Ah... and if you have to travel for the appointment, you have to come back in one or two weeks with your test results which they don't do on the same day like in Brazil! :S

**HOOKUP SEX** \- If an Italian hookup invites you for sex, expect car sex or to hide in the woods (sesso all’aperto, Italians love that)... People will hardly pay for a daily rate of a hotel just to have sex, hourly rates are rare... Most hookups really have sex outside if none can host... So you don't wash and go home all sticky (more chances for STDs). For Brazilians, that can be offensive. In Brazil, we have a proper place to take sex dates: motels. They are not like USA motels (which are usually cheap accommodation even for families), Brazilian motels are only for sex and they are all around. There are the trashy ones, but the general concept are clean, comfortable rooms you pay per hour… Any average motel will have a proper bed, shower, mirrors, romantic decoration, TV with porn… you can upgrade to a room with private pool, sauna, hydromassage, roses and champagne (just Google: Brazilian motel)… with all discretion, you usually choose from a screen, no face contact with the staff. If a Brazilian date has sex with you in a car or around some bush, it can be very offensive, it means you are not even worth the money of the motel... which is usually a comfortable hygienic place for that.

I just try to imagine how hard all these situations must be for young Italians, especially gays, when some simple things seem so inaccessible.

Anyway, I’m just curious: what are things like where you live?"

 I started taking PrEP about three weeks ago, and I still feel pretty sick. I’m nauseated most of the time and have stomach cramps after almost every time I eat. The literature on PrEP says stomach issues may be a short-term side effect. 

I know that this is not the place to seek medical advice, and I’ll see my doctor if it persists or gets worse, but just wondering if anyone else has had the same problems. How long did it last for you? Anything you did or any over the counter medications you took that helped?

When I used to ""try to use condoms"" I ended up only using them about half the time (I really really dislike them), so I took the sensible decision of getting on PrEP, because it was 2017 and we could do that. However I'm mostly into guys that are considerably older than me (40-50 usually) and as a result almost all the gay guys I know are HIV+ (and undetectable) because they were sexually active for a long time before PrEP was a thing. I mean, I even worked out that even if I did use condoms 100% of the time (which is far from realistic) I would have a 50% chance of becoming HIV positive within 20 years, just from broken condoms - based on my current sexual behaviour. Obviously without using condoms 100% of the time that time period would shorten drastically.  

  

Here's the weird conflicting thing, I look at it and I know it's irrational, but I'm asking you lot on here because I feel like I can't talk to my friends about it because they are HIV+ and would probably think I'm being ridiculous to the point of it being super frustrating for them, because I know that at least some of them would definitely much rather be in my position (although I suspect that some don't really give a shit, but I can't be certain). Basically as almost all the gay men I know (read: most of these are either current fuckbuddies or friends I have previously fucked) are HIV+ and undetectable, taking PrEP not only seems like a slightly pointless exercise (even if I did catch it I could easily get on treatment - which could be same pills I'm taking anyway - and be undetectable and have no issues) but because of this pointlessness it almost feels like I'm putting some kind of stigma on people who are HIV+, because it's like saying ""even though functionally our lives are the same - we have the same level of HIV-related health problems i.e. none, and we take the same medication - I very much do not want to be like you, to the point where I take a medication to avoid it"". This is the thing, as being HIV- and being undetectable are functionally the same, it just feels a bit weird trying so hard to avoid switching from one to the other. On top of that I feel kind of guilty because if I had been having sex as early as I would have liked (I've always been extremely hypersexual but at the same time I was extremely tentative towards hookups for a long time - now I love it) I would definitely have been HIV+ by now, and many of my friends may have been more careful or less whorish than me, but just from having been born considerably earlier have caught HIV whereas I can do what the fuck I like without catching it. It just feels bad to me. But I can't really understand it because I know that rationally taking PrEP is the sensible thing to do - and I wouldn't be seeking to catch HIV or anything, but at the same time I just kind of wonder if it would make sense to not be taking PrEP...  

  

The other thing I want to mention is that I mostly feel like this when it comes up in conversation, I try not to bring it up but sometimes it comes up naturally, either because a. the other wants to disclose or b. I have to take my medication and I always feel more comfortable if I explain to the other guy what medication I'm taking (I take quite a few different ones) or c. a few reasons that I don't want to go into because they would make me too identifiable, but basically, I do actually have other links to HIV outside of being a sexually active gay man, so sometimes that can come up in conversation.  

  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I guess what I'm really asking is, does anyone feel similar, know anyone who feels like this, or have some kind of explanation or logical reasoning that would at least help me understand how I feel or maybe marry up the emotional side with the logical side? It feels like they're two unrelated trains of thought and that would be why it feels like some kind of cognitive dissonance"

I talked with my insurance today and found it is covered for me. Descovy was FDA approved a couple months ago as effective PrEP treatment for HIV risk individuals. 

I'm currently on Truvada which is Emtricitibine Tenofovir Disproxl  Funerate (TDF) , Descovy is Emtricitibine Tenofovir Alafenamide Funerate (TAF). 

From what I have read, TAF/Descovy is a more potent form of the antiretroviral and thus can be delivered in smaller doses than TDF/Truvada. This has the benefit of being less harsh on your bones, liver, and kidneys.  

My liver, kidneys, and bones have been fine this past year on Truvada. But I plan to be on PrEP until I'm in a committed relationship (aka till who knows when). So I was looking at Descovy because it's supposed to be less harsh on liver/kidney/bones because of the lower dose which is something important to me if I'm going to be on PrEP for a while.

So, I wanted to tell everyone who would think otherwise about this and especially in the gays community from a long time now.

I see more and more people on app like Grindr and other, in stories here on Reddit (real or fictional) and elsewhere on the internet talk about “it's OK” to have BBK sex while you're one PrEP.

Of course, I'm really not against it, on the contrary, in fact. However, I'm not willing to take it. And this is why:

PrEP are only made to prevent HIV to be transmitted to one another. And, well, this is really thrilling for people who date someone seropositive. But actually for me this is the only reason I would take it.

Well why? You gonna ask: HIV IS NOT THE ONLY STD!

There is, unfortunately a lot more: Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, HPV, Herpes, Syphilis, for some example ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_infection#Transmission)).

Well it's not only the reason either: I don't have enough sexual partner to want PrEP and I always use condoms, as my partner take it or not. And if the condom broke the HIV is not the disease that I'm the most afraid. I think with the triple therapy, today you can “live”. (Fun fact in it the third thing is like the PrEP).

The std that I'm most afraid today is the Hepatitis C (if you're vaccinated to HPV Hepatitis A and B and maybe other that I'm not thinking now). Because today it might be a treatment for it but it works only for 90% for those and only those are diagnosed (and a lot are not).

However, it has become an excuse for having unprotected sex, under the justification that AIDS is the only condition that can't be cured. I mean, isn't this wreckless behaviour going to have serious consequences?

1. There are other diseases out there; sure, you can argue that those diseases are generally curable until they're not. Antibiotic-resistant STDS are becoming more common, and, even if cured, can leave a devastating impact on your body. This type of behaviour favours the emergence of such diseases, and yet these people seem to be indifferent to that. 
2. PrEP doesn't protect you against HPV, which is strongly associated with serious diseases, such as anal or throat cancer.
3. PrEP may work against HIV at the moment, but what happens if a new strain of the virus emerges and PrEP is no longer effective against that mutation?

I mean, how hard is it to just wear a condom? I know, bareback sex is a pleasurable thing and I understand why people want to do it, but still, we're talking about a matter of health, public health, not just of the individual.

I want to start PrEP. I'm on my parents' insurance with $5000 deductible, which means I'll have to pay out-of-pocket for PrEP for the first couple months.

My question: Does the Gilead copay card cover the amount I would have to pay out-of-pocket until I meet my deductible? In other words, would it pay the 1800/mo for the first 3 months (1800*3 to meet my deductible) before my private insurance kicks in?

But I feel like there hasn’t been enough put out there about safely switching from truvada to DESCOVY for PrEP for those who have had potentially risky encounters. 

Let’s assume someone on PrEP has had unprotected sex and was exposed to HIV recently while on Truvada. The next day they stop taking Truvada and switch to DESCOVY. It takes DESCOVY 7 days to reach protective levels. Meanwhile their protection from Truvada is quickly leveling off before then, potentially allowing the virus to take hold before their descovy has reached maximum protection? 

It seems to me maybe the best course for these people is to continue taking Truvada for 28 days following the last risky encounter, as recommended, switch to descovy and THEN continue to abstain from sex for the 7 days it takes descovy to reach protective levels.

So now that I’m on prep I’m feeling a lot better about it! The one question I have is whether or not it helps with prevention through transmission through oral.

I know condoms nor PrEP are 100% effective. So, short of a situation where someone is in a committed relationship with someone else whose already HIV positive, is it really a more considerable option than just using condoms?

I’m a black Transman who is attractive and in shape. I’ve been on Grindr and Jack’d for a long second and its be just aight. Random hookups are plentiful but finding a FWB has been difficult. I only sleep with black gay/bi men and most are either dl or disinterested in anything consistent.

My issue is that I met a guy who has expressed a desire for FWB but he is HIV positive. Although I’ve been on Prep for a minute I still don’t feel comfortable sleeping with someone I know is positive. It’s like I’ve heard the statistics about HIV prevalence in the gay community but having someone actually say they are positive is making me question if hooking up with him is worth it. Idk how to explain it, but knowing he is positive is messing with my anxiety in ways that not knowing wouldn’t. Intellectually I know that Prep and condoms means I’m protected really well but emotionally I’m still scared. My feelings are also complicated by the fact that I’ve had two different men lie to me about their status. I don’t know what to do.

I immediately reply giving a pharmacy and information.... nothing. Thursday morning “ok we will ask one of our doctors to prescribe you medication for this”. Great.

Nothing.... literally it has now been 56 hours (and potentially longer if it took time for them to initially let me know) and I STILL haven’t gotten meds prescribed. I could ask for the test results in paper but that is usually a 24hr+ delay and to use it I would have to pay for a physician visit as I have no usual primary care provider.

I just want meds for my STI so the pain can go away....

Anywho tomorrow I have some plans that might lead to this being dealt with if they don’t get their act together but it’s more expensive than it should be and involves me completely changing my plans for the day to visit the health department and an office and a pharmacy.

This whole incident has removed all my faith in Nurx. How can they not treat an STI they diagnosed me with quickly. I need to find some other way to get prep.

My issue has always been that I am constantly moving cities and will continue to do so so I can’t work with a consistent provider, or the lgbt center in my city (not every place I go to has one), and the city one I am at currently only does a temporary 3 month course until you can find a proper provider.

My insurance situation is complicated, but the gist is that I don't have any coverage that would have allowed me to get PrEP.

And for me in New York, there's also the [Uninsured Care Programs](https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/aids/general/resources/adap/), which can also cover doctor visits related to getting and staying on PrEP, but they both required a lot of information that for me I didn't have on hand or would have been really complicated to go through.

But I saw that a new Federal program was started early December (Ready, Set, PrEP) last year to pay for PrEP for people without insurance or without insurance that covers prescription medication. It asked for my information and my doctor's information and within about ten seconds of hitting submit, it told me that I was approved for the program and I got the card to give to the pharmacy. I called my pharmacy with the information and they told me it was all approved and I could come in today to pick it up.

It seems like a great new program that can help, but I'm not seeing anyone talking about it yet, so I thought it could help to spread the word.

I feel like the rest of the symptoms could be a result from the first. Being exhausted and not sleeping well could cause these. Mind you, I have tried periods of being on and off PrEP and the off times the symptoms went away.

Now I want to try get back on prep, but don't know where to start. I searched online for insurance that covers prep, doctor visit, and lab, but can't really find an affordable one ( I am in WA).  


Then I stumbled upon a site getpreponline dot com. They sell Tenof-EM (generic to truvada) for a reasonable price it seems. Only thing is that I don't really find much review of the site, and the email from their support said I do not need prescription to order them.

Do you think it's shady? It would be a really affordable option for me if it works, but I am skeptical."

Before creating this post (throw away account), I've trawled the web/reddit to try and find the answers myself, but I would like to ask real people instead of generic google answers.

I am an inexperienced bottom and would like to go to bathhouses in an upcoming trip in couple weeks time. I may also try to hook up via grindr. I would likely engage in oral, and try anal, but safe play only 100,000% I dont give a fuck if they aren't down, etc I just wouldn't do it withut condoms. I would also use lube, not spit, and ensure my best that it doesn't break. I imagine I would go to bathhouses couple times, and I will be mindful of any cuts in my mouth (if so, no oral). No swallowing at all.

Now - do I really need to go on prep for this? Would this be considered high risk? I have done the std check and everything is all clear, but I have yet to do the blood kidney test thing. Realistically, I would not be able to get the pills before I go on my trip, which means I may have to resort to buying them online wihtout having any tests done.

What are your honest thoughts on this situation? If I play safe with condoms, can I get away with this or what?

She asked why I was at the doctor and I told her I was getting blood work done.  She asked why I'm always getting blood work done. I just told her my doctor is thorough.  That kept her quiet for now, but she's a nurse so I'm sure she is suspicious.

Another single friend has to keep his PrEP a secret from his parents, he's much younger and still lives with his mother. When she found it and confronted him about it, she flipped because she thought it meant he was being promiscuous.  She threw it out, so he's had to keep it in a locked box in his room ever since.

When I've had to disclose to other medical providers (optometrists and such) I've had to explain what it is and say it's like the gay birth control.

I've been a top for many years but want to get into trying bottoming, however I've had digestive problems in the past (now mostly solved) but still don't particularly trust my digestive system to do the work.

I started eating a much more healthy diet about 3-4 months ago - more dark leafy vegetables (spinach, broccoli etc), lean meats and things like sweet potato mash, wholegrain rice instead of chips. Also porridge oats for breakfast. This seemed to have a better effect on my digestion, but I'd still say it was irregular in the sense that I couldn't tell what time of the day I'd need to go or how clean I'd be.

I started taking psyllium husk about a week and a half ago, two tablets three times a day. Initially I didn't notice much of a difference, but after about 3 days I noticed that I was going to the toilet normally about half an hour after breakfast, then again half an hour later, and then didn't need to go for the rest of the day. This normally always wasn't exactly 'clean'.

I've now switched to trying Pure for Men (2 x capsules after breakfast, 2 x capsules before dinner) and the effect is largely the same as psyllium - only going in the morning, not clean.

The thing is, this is somewhat fine - it means that if I clean up a bit in the shower and wait a couple of hours, it seems I'm good to go (I played around with my ass yesterday evening and it was clean without me having to douche or anything).

Is this basically the best I can expect with taking fiber supplements? I had read that they were meant to hold your bowel movements together better and I was hoping to be clean after having gone in the morning, but that hasn't happened. It's still a massive improvement, but just checking if there's anything I can be doing better."

They’re very religious, and being on Prep is not something they would allow.

I know Gilead has the advancing access program for uninsured people, and I’ve heard rumors of some people successfully navigating getting on that despite being on their parents insurance.  Does anyone have experience with this?  Would like really like to be on prep, but if I can’t get on gileads free program, I don’t know if it’s possible.  I contacted the local LGBT center, and was told my best bet was to wait until I’m 26 and kicked off my parents insurance 😔 (I will be a student until age 27, so I won’t have access to insurance through work any time soon).

If, say, I took 2 pills on Sunday in anticipation of sex on Monday. But the sex didn't occur on Monday, so I did not take a pill on Monday. Today is Tuesday, and I'm planning to have sex tomorrow. **Should I re-initiate the PrEP on demand using 2 pills or 1 pill?** 

Most of the sources online say if you did PrEP 2+1+1 in the past 7 days, you should only take 1 pill to resume. But in my case, I only took the initial 2 pill dose and never followed up with the 1+1 because the original sex did not occur. How should I resume? 

I'm going to ask the clinic tomorrow if I can reach them but as you know every health service is reduced right now because of COVID-19. So if any of you know the answer I'd really appreciate it?"

So 3-4 days of missed doses 😔 I then took prep for 3 days after the exposure ( I didn’t realise that I was supposed to continue for 28 days).

I then must have missed 5 or 6 days and then continued taking the rest of my prep until finishing the bottle on the 14th may. 

I appreciate that oral transmission is very low, but it I still possible. 
Since the incident I’ve had a sore throat, multiple occasions of night sweats, swollen lymph nodes in my armpit, pain in my groin. a rash on my stomach that resolved after a few days, and most recently a series of 7 boils that appears on my lower leg. 

I took an at home test kit (3rd generation) on the 17th May (one month after exposure) which returned a negative result - is that reliable? Or does prep affect the results.

I've never taken it before and got it for if I wanted to hook up to give me peace of mind. I understand you have to take one pill per day for protection, and have to be taking it for like 4-7 days before actually being protected when having sex. But you can also take it on-demand, 2 pills 2-24hrs before sex, then one per day for two days after the sex.

I was wondering specifically, can you take it on demand, and then transition into taking it daily? E.g. you hook up and take the two pills on demand, then after the hookup you take it for two days, but then just continue. Are you 'fully protected' after those 2 days or does your 5-7 day timer only start from the first of the two post-sex pills you take? 

And then how does taking it on demand work if you're trying to build up to the daily dose immunity? E.g. you've take a single pill for 2 days, but want to hook up. If you take it on-demand, does that immunity also speed up your daily dosing immunity, or does it reset it, or does it just kind of pause it?

During around 2 weeks I was taking daily PreP with somehow of a poor adherence(maybe missing two doses) because I wasn't sure about continuing during this pandemic.  Despite that, on Monday the 6th of July, I had unprotected sex as an insertive partner with someone that first declared to be negative, but later told that he wasn't sure. He decided to test, finding out he's positive for HIV and syphilis around 3 days after we met.

Despite being on PreP for around two weeks, I am now concerned about my poor adherence prior to the experience.  Until that date, I had taken 13 pills and 4 in a row, but the fact that we engaged with no condoms, no lubricant, and the likely presence of an STI makes me feel very nervous.

On July 8th, I went to an HIV specialist and she told me that I'll be ok because I was protected by then, plus finding the third drug for a full PEP protocol would be impossible to achieve before the 72 hours(PEP is usually the same drug as PreP plus a third one and should be taken 72 hours max. after the exposure).

I know that the only thing I can do know is just waiting for my test. But I am super ultra worried about the fact that I've been having headaches and cold symptoms since the event.

A common misconception is that PrEP is too expensive to be able to get started on it. I've seen some recent posts about people who recently found out they had HIV and had been considering PrEP. This is devastating and can be helped - PrEP is not as cost prohibitive as you may think!

You can sign up for a copay assistance card (super easy!) by going here: [Gilead Advancing Access](https://www.gileadadvancingaccess.com/copay-coupon-card); this card pays your copay, and if you don't have insurance can cover the full cost of the prescription.

You can also get PrEP without visiting your primary doctor - another thing I've seen is that some doctors are just plain ignorant of what PrEP is and won't prescribe it. You can do telemedicine to get started with PrEP - I used Nurx to get mine, paid $30 for the consult. They also send labs for you to complete at home, and if you have insurance work with them for coverage to pay for that - if not, it's $99 to pay for the labs. You can get Nurx here: [Nurx App (Apple)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nurx-birth-control-and-prep/id1213141301) or [Nurx Website](https://www.nurx.com/prep/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=bc&amp;utm_campaign=brand_nurx_exact&amp;utm_term=nurx%20prep&amp;g_acctid=687-940-1110&amp;g_campaign=Brand_Nurx_Exact&amp;g_campaignid=1646705171&amp;g_adgroupid=63407319739&amp;g_adid=319019510837&amp;g_keyword=nurx%20prep&amp;g_keywordid=kwd-542535808759&amp;g_network=g&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwjer4BRCZARIsABK4QeXDuisPCBgd6aO7KonyRrUnZf1dcE7ClSq0q0bIzkqarb6u3Gg7TWsaAiRCEALw_wcB), and a discount code here for the consult: [Nurx Discount Code](https://www.retailmenot.com/view/nurx.com)

There are other apps and services you can use, but the most important link here is the Gilead copay card to help cover the cost. Also just remember that PrEP isn't a replacement for safer sex, but at least it can HELP prevent HIV infections. I hope this helps someone."

**Please get on PrEP to prevent HIV transmission in our community.**

I've recently learned a lot about HIV. Things I wish I would've been taught by a Gay big bro, by my Doctor, or by a sex ed class. Things I strongly encourage you to learn, like, for example, that a positive top is 10x more likely to pass HIV to a negative bottom than a positive bottom is to pass HIV to a negative top, or that HIV transmission from oral is extremely unlikely, and more. Another thing I've learned is that a man on PrEP is taking care of himself and his partners, a lot like how a mask-wearer is preventing CoViD-19.

**Here are 14 reasons I could think of that you should be on PrEP, or Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis, to help prevent the spread of HIV among our community.**

\+++

# 1 PrEP is nearly 100% effective in preventing HIV infection following exposure

While there are some (3 or so documented) possible cases of men getting HIV after starting PrEP, overall, men who take PrEP and avoid taking injectable drugs while sharing needles are almost guaranteed to not contract HIV when exposed if they are consistent with PrEP.

# 2 It can be cheap or free.

USA here. Our healthcare system sucks. That said, for most people on conventional insurance, PrEP is discounted with insurance enough that a ""co-pay card"" from its maker Gilead will make it free. In most socialized healthcare countries, PrEP is the cost of a lunch per month. Summer 2021 should see a generic option for Truvada as well, which will be much more affordable for the uninsured. Finally, many local HIV prevention organizations will help LGTBQ men pay for PrEP.

# 3 It helps stop the spread of other STIs too*

Doctors who will monitor your PrEP regimine generally use your PrEP checkups to also monitor you for other common STDs/STIs and your overall sexual health. This means that they'll catch other things before you spread them--especially since some STDs/STIs can be asymptomatic.

*Huge disclaimer: PrEP itself doesn't prevent other STDs/STIs, only HIV, but your Doctor's management of your sexual health will.*

# 4 HIV takes a while to show itself on lab tests; doesn't mean a negative test means the person is negative

HIV doesn't immediately show up in lab tests after an exposure. In fact, it can take between 2 and 12 weeks and up to six months! Depending on the time between an exposure and a recent HIV test, someone could get a negative result and a few weeks later the infection takes hold with the person thinking they are negative until thier next test.

# 5 ""Clean"" or ""Disease Free"" and other Self-reported status is really meaningless.

The idea of choosing your partners based on their status is referred to as ""serosorting."" Serosorting fails when someone claiming to be of a certain status is not. Relying on another's self-reported status is unreliable at best.

A person tested 3 months ago with no recent sexual partners is minimal risk. Meanwhile, a person tested on the same day but with one recent sexual partner has some risk. And a third person tested on the same day but who has had 30 sexual partners is a much greater risk. All will self-report that they are ""clean, last tested 3 months ago."" Combined with the point about HIV's delayed infection following exposure, who knows if anyone is really ever ""clean""?

Merely asking a potential partner if they are ""clean"" is useless in determining your risk with them.

# 6 You can get HIV the first time you have sex.

My boyfriend--the catalyst for my self-education into HIV in fact--was diagnosed with HIV. He had penetrative sex (anal sex) with three men, his first with whom he did not use a condom, his second with whom he did, and me. Since I don't have HIV, he strongly believes his first time having sex was the day he got HIV.

# 7 Condoms work. Period. Until that one time they don't

Condoms work. You should use them. PrEP does not prevent other STDs/STIs, but condoms do. Yet sometimes condoms fail. They sometimes break, especially if they are older; and people who are not regularly having sex and/or are recently out of a relationship may be more likely to use an expired condom. Also, some condoms are too small for bigger guys and some condoms are too big for smaller guys and condom effectiveness requires the right sized condom. These are reasons condoms can fail.

# 8 ""In the Moment"" we make bad choices

So what if them condom fails or is too tight? You're in the heat of the moment. ""Just finish."" This is the second point where serosorting fails, by the way, ""in the heat of the moment.""

Speaking of ""in the heat of the moment,"" sometimes an opportunity arises that you didn't plan for. You're at your friends house party drunk and miles from your condoms and lube and you meet a guy and one things leads to another and you both run off to the garage for a quickie. We are gay men, we are sexual, and sometimes spontaneous stuff wants to happen. PrEP can protect you even in those moments.

And ""in the moment"" applies to monogamous couples too. Hey, we are humans. Especially gay humans! My boyfriend and I have had a moment or two where things went little too far with a friend. It was hot stuff each time, never resulting in penetration, but could've, perhaps. And we aren't unique. You don't plan for it to happen, but in the heat of the moment, it might!

# 9 ""Stealthing"" is a thing.

""Stealthing"" happens when an insertive partner (top) discreetly removes a condom that the receptive partner (bottom) requested that be worn, especially during a hookup. They may or may not finish inside, finishing on the partner's back, for example, so to hide their misdeeds, but whether they come in or out of their partner, they will still leave behind bodily fluids that could infect their partner, sometimes without the bottom knowing they were just exposed.

# 10 And so is rape/sexual assault.

While some people consider ""stealthing"" to be a form of rape or sexual assault, there is also more overt rape or sexual assault that PrEP can at least protect you from an HIV transmission from. Whether it be a date rape, or a violent rape, or a partner not respecting the limits of their bottom, it happens. And if it's happening, it's unlikely that a condom will be worn or that both parties check each other's status before it starts.

# 11 Cheating happens in monogamous relationships.

When I first learned my boyfriend had HIV, I suspected he cheated--I now believe he didn't. We do, however, have friends who got HIV from monogamous partners. On a totally different note, my Mom was given herpes from my cheating Father (a fact I wish I didn't know). This can and does happen.  And I'm not just referring to your partner cheating on you, but also you cheating on your partner. You trust each other with your hearts, but mistakes happen. Protect yourself (and protect them) at least from a lifelong infection of HIV.

# 12 It takes a while to start PrEP, and longer to begin being protected by it

You shouldn't wait until you need it, because by then it will be too late. Getting PrEP isn't as easy as going to your drug store.

First you need to get an appointment with a PrEP-friendly Doctor. My main Doctor doesn't want to manage it because he isn't knowledgeable in it, so I see a different doctor for my sexual health. This can take a few days to a few weeks to get an appointment. Then most doctors will require you complete STD/STI testing before you start PrEP. This can take another week. Many USA insurance policies may require you get special clearance to take PrEP, which can cause another days to weeks delay. Then, once you finally have PrEP, you need to take it daily for seven days to have the shield against HIV be fully deployed in your body.

When I was coming out, I did it pretty quickly. I went from ""I'm going to go into this gay chat room"" to making out, dicks out, in my truck with a guy in six days. It takes more than six days to start PrEP. So even if you are not sexually active right now because of the Pandemic or because you aren't dating or whatever, now is the best time to start PrEP, so that when the moment comes, you can enjoy it!

# 13 HIV+ Stigma is Real--and stupid--but real

I'll be honest with you all, knowing what I know now, if I had the option to have sex with a Undetectable HIV+ (U=U) person over a ""clean"" person, I'd take the U=U person in a heartbeat! I trust they are taking care of themselves far more than I trust a ""clean"" person is, because its life and death for a positive person!

But most people still hold the HIV stigma. They assume the positive person got it because they were generally irresponsible, or a slut, or a whore. Yet, in fact, a lot of people get it because someone they trusted didn't know they had it, or because someone lied to them, or because one ""in the heat of moment"" moment turned out to be the wrong time to take a risk.

You don't want the stigma to dog your sex life. On the flip side, be part of the solution to the stigma, please!

# 14 You're Looking Out for Our LGTBQ future by taking PrEP

Finally, just like we are wearing masks to look out for others, taking PrEP is looking out for our community. Transmission is higher now than it has been since the 1980's and its because we both have let our guard down and because we aren't teaching our LGTBQ youth how to truly protect themselves from it while also letting our media, especially gay porn, go back to glorifying bare sex. Take PrEP today to prevent the need for it tomorrow.

# Notes:

* I am not a doctor. Just an average gay bro.
* This is my throwaway because I don't want to broadcast my bf's or my mom's business.
* My partner and I are still together, and in fact, since the third month after his diagnosis are better than ever. He is now undetectable.
* For PrEP, I took Truvada from October until this month, and started Descovy this month.
* Gilead Sciences, the makers of both PrEP's, are absolutely trash people. They price gouge, they are being sued by the US for anti-competitive practices and for violating patents co-owned by the US Government including on parts of the PrEP formula, and just suck as people. I  do hate that I'm enriching them by getting PrEP, but until an alternate option exists this will have to do!

My reasons for not taking it are that I am mainly into oral sex, safer sex acts with little/no fluid exchange, into hook ups, and yes I know there's risk with oral but I am picky who I give it to, and I assume whoever I have sex with is HIV+ or could be or have other diseases and still have safer sex. I do not have sex with anyone who fucks/gets fucked without condoms or who uses any drugs. I have no desire at all to be a lab rat or guinea pig for a pharmaceutical company either.

When I have had anal or vaginal sex it was with partners and condoms were always used and I was on top and I have no desire to ever bottom for anal sex at all.

I have friends who are HIV+ or living with AIDS and they all told me how when they were on Truvada it had horrible side effects and that the drug is highly toxic. A friend was on PREP and it fucked up his liver and he had to go off of it under the supervision of his physician. My friend is much older and said how it is best for bisexual and gay men to use condoms for anal sex as Truvada does not protect against all other diseases, and people who were taking prep/Truvada daily as prescribed still have gotten infected with HIV and while this is apparently rare it has happened, and the medication does not protect against all types or strains of HIV. My older friend also said how he avoids having sex with men who are on PREP/Truvada as most gay and bisexual men do not use condoms if they take it and just use it as an excuse to continue having unsafe sex like they are used to or did before Truvada/PREP was marketed towards perfectly healthy HIV- gay and bisexual men."

So just wondering if anyone knew how effective prep is in regards to oral sex? Like I know it is supposed to be super effective for anal but does it differ? 

I’m stressed because I hooked up with a guy (MSM), I was giving oral (no anal) I’ve been taking my prep daily for the past 4 weeks and I don’t think I missed any doses, and continued to do so after the encounter - but we didn’t use protection. He said he was tested 4 months ago but surely he could have caught something between. 
He bit my lip while kissing and it started bleeding too. 
Do you think it’s likely to contract HIV in this situation? 
He didn’t ejaculate in the mouth. 

It’s just giving me a lot of anxiety.

At first glance, it looks like their card is a $600/month maximum with no yearly cap. I have a HDHP and I have a feeling that I'll have to pay for my first month of PrEP next year (The first month it's ~$1400 out of pocket, but the co-pay card covers it.

But my stomach was still bad as well as my back.  I talked with a doctor who asked if I had any new partners and I didn’t only had two people I slept with one is on prep and the other isn’t but is negative for STI. So the doctor thinks it could be an allergy to the truvada. Has anyone ever experienced this. I get tested every three months and I use safe sex 98% of the time if I don’t know the person. Obviously we don’t know what everyone always doing in that 2% but that’s why I decided to stay with prep. I’m curious to know has anyone ever gotten a form of rashes like this while on truvada.

I know I might get judged here but I'm just thinking about it at the moment, I haven't actually done anything yet, and I might not do anything but I am curious, but also hugely conflicted. I'm obviously not the first person to go through this but for now I'm just asking questions...

So I'm a married, closeted Bisexual. And have been thinking about / fantasizing about having sex with a guy. Like, alot! It's becoming obsessive. I dream about it. Whenever I get a moment alone I masturbate to gay porn. It's being built up so much that I'm just thinking of pulling the trigger and having a brief gay affair, just to know, you know. 

Now if I were too go through with it obviously condoms should be used, but I want to bottom, and in order to best safeguard against any potential ""accident"" or ""spillage"" what is the general consensus around trying to get a prescription for PreP and using it in the short term up to a potential explicit sexual weekend, and then shortly thereafter for added protection? I'm not making a commentary here about how the risk of HIV is higher in m2m sex, I know statistically I'm quiet safe from a data perspective, I just awash with questions and anxiety and horniness and probably a bunch of terrible mistakes just waiting to happen. When I smoke weed I get incredibly horny, and poppers added to the mix might make for some crazy sexual decisions and if condoms are present but not used and afterwards I'm racked with guilt and fear for potentially catching an STD... ugh. I don't know, and I don't mean to be offensive or anything I'm still struggling with all of this. 

Also, is Grindr the best place to find hookups? I guess I'm thinking about this now because I'm headed for a trip alone to Palm Springs soon and I'm either going to jerk off alone in my hotel room with a dildo or become a little whore and I'd like to be prepared either way."

This rule, called an Accumulator Adjustment, allows health plans and employers to limit out-of-pocket expenses on prescription drugs to those that were actually incurred by the patients, and not consider any copay assistance the patient may receive from drug manufacturers.

For example, if you have a $1,000 deductible for prescriptions, and your insurer will no longer count coupon cards towards your deductible, this change means that you will be required to pay your $1,000 deductible out of pocket when picking up your first PrEP refill in 202. 

While each health plan/health insurer has different policies, many of the largest health plans in the U.S. have already released plans to limit the amount pharmaceutical companies, like Gilead, pay on your behalf and not count that towards your deductible. 

Some of the largest health plans, including United Health Group and Anthem/BlueCross/BlueShield, have already released information that indicates they will follow the new HHS rule and not consider prescription coupon cards towards your deductible. 

If you happen to live in Arizona, Illinois, Virginia or West Virginia these changes won’t apply to you because your state has already passed state laws that prohibit insurers from excluding coupon card payments from your deductible accumulation. 

If you like in any of the other 46 states you can call your insurance company and ask about your 2021 deductible for prescription medications, and ask them specifically if they will allow the use of coupon cards to meet your deductible. 

If you happen to be enrolled in a plan that won't count coupon cards towards your deductible, you can ask you doctor about the generic version of Truvada and see if that is a more affordable option for you. If you can no longer afford PrEP you should make sure you use condoms each and every time you have intercourse.

I have recently started taking prep to add an extra layer of protection from HIV and am now halfway through my first bottle. During my first visit, I was only allowed to purchase 1 bottle (30 pills) and will be allowed to 2 and 3 bottles on my second and third visit, respectively. I had a bit of an idea about event-driven dosing and asked about it. The counsellor told me that they usually introduce this alternative dosing during follow-up visits as they really recommend that prep is taken daily especially by first-time users so that they develop adherence and that their body gets used to it and from there, they could switch from daily to event-driven dosing. Since we were already there, he complied and discussed it to me.

For daily dosing, I read that maximum protection is reached at about 7 days of daily use (receptive anal sex). I read that it is important not to miss a dose as a certain level of threshold must be maintained for effective HIV prevention. Should one wish to stop completely from taking prep (daily), I read that he should keep on taking for 30 more days from the date of last encounter. Further, I read that drugs remain in the body for several days after stopping. As to how long, I do not know.

This is where things become confusing to me (or I got things mixed up). After I finish my  first bottle, I definitely plan on switching to event-driven dosing. I consider myself to be at low risk of HIV infection, i.e. infrequent sex lifestyle. For an instance, 2 weeks have passed since I have taken my last pill (daily dosing) and **unprotected sex happens with correct 2+1+1/ on-demand dosing**, am I still protected from possible infection? And what if **next encounter (unprotected) happens one (1), or two (2) months later**, will those 4 pills in total be effective in protecting me?

Thank you very much in advance for shedding light on this one.

P.S. I definitely plan on asking these questions on my next visit, which will be 2 weeks from now but I hope to get answers sooner."

We originally talked about it a year ago. At the time, I think she really didn't know anything about it, but prescribed it to me anyway. I never filled the prescription because I was intending to hold off until I moved across country for school, then the pandemic hit, and I thought that going celibate for most of the pandemic would be prudent. 

However, despite the pandemic, I'd like to slowly and cautiously get out and date someone. When I was talking to my doctor, I was asking her that since I'm not very sexually active, then what if I sporadically took Truvada? I.e., starting a couple days before I might have sex.

Besides explaining why this is a bad idea because the medicine needs to maintain a certain level in the system over time, she kind of made a few remarks that made me scratch me head:

She said that if I wasn't very sexually active, then I may not really need Truvada, saying that as long as I took proper precautions (I.e., condom) then I would be just as protected from HIV as I would be with Truvada. And that Truvada is really designed for someone who is in a long term relationship with someone who is HIV positive. 

At the end of the day, I said that since I figured out how to enroll and print off a coupon card from Gilead (the manufacturer of Truvada) and that I could get it for free, then even if I'm not having much sex, I should just get Truvada and take it every day.

Does that make any sense to you? Like, is she somehow being homophobic without realizing it or something? 

Lastly, we also discussed how one of the requirements of taking Truvada is getting regular STD testing every 3 months. Does anyone here who takes PreP get tested that frequently?

Sorry if I sound ignorant of these things. My sex life has always been non-existent (i.e., on average once every 18 months). But now that I've moved out of my parents and attending grad school, I would like to enjoy more sexual encounters."

2nd scenario. I’m a sexually active person. Always protect myself with a condom, always make sure the person I’m having sex is safe and never mix alcohol/drugs while doing so. Do I need prep? Makes sense to have an extra layer of protection but do I absolutely need it? 

3rd. Am on prep sexually active person but found the love of my life, we’ve been with each other for months and a true monogamous relationship. Can I stop taking prep?

I recently started on PrEP. Gladly my insurance covers the medicine at 0 copay, but the clinic I am receiving Prescriptions is “out of network”. (long story). 

So I am going to an out of network clinic which initially offered some affordable options for out of pocket payments. Now they are showing me some attitude. 

In the meanwhile, I came across this. Online PreP from mistr. Below is what is mentioned on their website 

(PrEP is a once-daily pill regimen that is 99% effective at preventing HIV. With Mistr you can consult securely online with a licensed physician and complete all required PrEP lab testing at home. Insurance or no insurance, we got you covered. That’s right, your online consultation, labs, STI testing and medication are free for residents of *****

Most insurance plans cover PrEP – if yours doesn’t, we can help you qualify for patient assistance programs so you have no out of pocket costs. We handle all the paperwork for you, so it’s hassle free.

The required PrEP labs and doctor consult are free, as are all your STI testing. No needles or need to waste your time at the doctors office, you can do everything at home! Already have a prescription for PrEP? We offer free delivery anywhere in the United States, and we make prescription renewals quick and effortless.

No doctor’s office, no needles and no paperwork – get started now.)

Has any one used this service before? Are their claims true? How do they do basic labs / STI screening at home without needles?"

Its Sunday afternoon right now.

I at least definitely had prep Saturday morning and also today (sunday) morning.

I just topped a guy (at about 3pm) who says he was on prep but very quite rudely said to me when I asked him if he was on it, ""...yes... with a question mark"". This was said after we fooled around.

The experience started with condoms on but at one point I realised the condom broke. I might have been topping him raw for about 4 minutes before I pulled out and realised. Also my penis started burning a bit. Not sure if its cause he was tight or not.

He suddenly decided he didn't wanna play anymore.

Hes since blocked me. 

Am I at risk?

I've come home (about 4pm) feeling quite down and took another 2 prep pills out of anxiety and paranoia. I will continue my daily prep from here on in. 

Do I need to be on PEP?

Advice and comments will be well appreciated. Thank you."

Quick question about going on PrEP and payment options. I am a 21 yo male, and would really like to go on PrEP, it would make me feel a lot better about having sex. However, I am still on my parent’s insurance plan and although I’ll get off when I graduate college and start my career, right now it doesn’t feel like I could use their insurance for it.

They do know I’m gay, they accept it somewhat, but they still cling to certain old-fashioned notions. Last November when I stayed over at my ex-boyfriend’s house one night and they found out about it after the fact, my dad told me that I shouldn’t be having sex before marriage, whether or not I’m gay. Didn’t really make a whole lot of sense to me. Also when I was 15 or so (granted, before they knew I was gay) and I went into a doctor’s checkup and my pediatrician said I should get HPV vaccine, my mom cut in and said it wasn’t necessary since I wasn’t having sex. I did eventually get it after she stopped accompanying me to doctor visits.

All of this has made me wary of using their insurance for anything related to sexual health. When I got mono at 18 I was worried I had some oral STI and they would find out about it if I got myself checked for STDs.

What’s my best recourse if I want to get on PrEP at an affordable price without alerting my parents?"

Sharing an org called Mistr which provides free STD testing and PrEP for residents in over 30 states. If you don't know, PrEP stands for ""Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis"" - it's medication that works to prevent HIV, if you plan to have unsafe sex. You have to take it regularly for it to work because it has to build up in your system, but it is a total miracle and saves so many lives. They're able to provide it for free because DHEC (the state health department) got a huge grant for this from the federal government, and it's something you should absolutely take advantage of. If you're regularly engaging in unsafe/condom-less sex or having sex with multiple partners this can support you in preventing HIV, however it does not protect you from Other STI’s.

I preped for some anal play with my gf the other day. I used a micralax mini enema, held it until I felt an urge to evacuate and then douched. I douched 4 or 5 times (one bulb at a time) and everything was definitely running clear by the 3rd or 4th. I waited maybe an hour or so before we got down to any play. Everything was fine during but when the toy came out (its a curved glass dildo, similar shape to an njoy pure wand) it was very unclean on the end (to say the least, I cold be more graffic but i'm sure you know what i'm getting at). She didn't go deep with the dildo, maybe 3 or 4 inches max.   


So what did I do wrong? What can I do in future to ensure things are less messy? Going the full enema route seems like a hassle and probably overkill since we don't do any real depth play. I already take a psyllium supplement every morning and my diet is pretty healthy for the most part.

I am not out as gay to my mother, but recently we had a talk about health insurance. We have a per-person limit of $500, and a family limit of $5000.

Due to the medications I'm on for depression and anxiety, I have probably already eaten up my per-person limit, and am working through the per-family limit.

I did not know this at the time that I filled the first month of my prescription, and I certainly can't fill the next month and eat away at my family's limit. I'd feel awful.

Supposedly, PrEP costs like $2000 for a month, so right away, I've eaten away 2/5 of my family's health insurance for the year. I can't in good conscience do that again.

on one hand it seems kind of pointless since he is HIV-free and we are exclusive, but on the other hand - it feels like the ""right thing to do"" as a sexually active person in the LGBT community with little downside otherwise. thoughts?"

I didn’t have mind clarity at the time to think clearly about my PrEP situation and I felt I didn’t have choice and I couldn’t get out of the situation even if I didnt feel comfortable because I was using PrEP as 2-1-1 instead of one daily. I felt like I was forced to have unprotected sex because he wanted me to fill him up otherwise he was looking at me like he was going to cry. We used condoms and he made me take it off at some point. We stopped for 30 mins. Then I felt bad and I ended up topping the guy for 1-2 minutes and I came in him before I left. I wasn’t mentally in a good situation to think. I freaked out when the reality hit and I went to ER the next day and the doctor gave me Tivicay as PEP and I took it on my 29th hour after sex. I took one pill today as the second day of (PrEP 2-1-1 usage). So, I’ve been taking PrEP since before the sex but I started using Tivicay additionally today since I freaked out. How likely I might have gotten HIV since the undetectable guy might have missed a couple of his daily pills? I don’t know how many days he missed but he said he missed a couple but he is undetectable.

I’m a researcher looking for participants for my study on PrEP use, knowledge, and perceptions among gay, bisexual, and queer men who live in rural areas of the northeastern United States (anywhere north of Maryland). Your participation would entail a confidential 60-minute interview via Zoom; you could either call the meeting with your phone or enter via Zoom with or without video. **All participants will receive a $25 Amazon gift card**

During the interview, I’d learn more about your sense of rural community, what it means to be gay/bi/queer in the rural US, and your thoughts about PrEP (e.g., barriers and facilitators to access, how aware your family/friends/providers are of PrEP, what you’d like PrEP-related health care to look like). Please note: we'd of course love to hear the thoughts of people who have taken/are taking PrEP; however, PrEP use is **NOT** a requirement for participation. We want to hear what all northeastern, rural men think about PrEP whether they have taken it or not! This study has been approved by the Tufts University SBER IRB.

Please consider helping me out with this important work! Unfortunately, fewer than a handful of studies have considered the impact of rurality on PrEP and the sexual health of gay, bisexual and queer men. We want to hear what YOU think. **For those who are interested, you can message me, contact the research team at (978) 358-1122, or email us at** [**prepstudy@tufts.edu**](mailto:prepstudy@tufts.edu)"

I was wondering if anyone had any information that could help me in this situation. My SO is undetectable but we talked about me trying to get on PrEP as an extra layer of protection. I went to my local LGBT+ clinic and they helped me fill out all the necessary paperwork. If I got PrEP I could just go pick it up from there and they would cover the copay. However, I had to use my parent's insurance. I'm scared that if I go to the doctor's appointment that the clinic helped me set up then my parents are going to see why I went and the medication that I'm going to get. Is there any way to prevent this? Or will it show up on the EOB regardless?

I've tried looking at other ways to get PrEP. I've looked at NURX but the price is a bit high for me and I worry that they will be able to find my insurance even if I don't give it to them. Jsyk, I'm 20, not out yet and living with my parents in the US. So if they were to see this it would be a major problem because they are super conservative and don't want me having sex with anyone, much less a man. I don't want to get kicked out over this but I also want to do it for my SO. I'm just scared that things will go badly.

tl;dr - Is there a way for me to get PrEP without using my parents' insurance? I don't want them to know I am taking it because it could be a big risk."

I hooked up with a guy dec 19 of last year. We had hooked up before and always used condoms. He is “bi” or so he says. 

Anyway, moving forward, I started PreP in September of last year. Have been using it everyday, and have missed it twice, purposely and recently accidentally took two doses of it in 1 day! 

Ok so we hooked up on Dec 19th, condom broke and we decided to go raw. He asked before me sitting on his dick if I was sure I was clean. Me being on prep said yes. He did cum inside. 

I was ok then later in December I noticed a sniffle and started freaking out completely! I got drunk New Year’s Eve, probably alcohol intoxicated and that’s the moment my anxiety kicked in and is still around. 

I tested 30 days after this encounter with Kaiser, 4th gen test and it came back negative. 

I’ve made several visits to the doctors about various issues and have been told I have allergies (recently bought a puppy and happens to be in allergic to dog hair). 

Anyway I have my 3 month regular testing next week and am trying to remain calm. I’ve had OCD all my life with anxiety and some depression so this is just too much!! 

I also had HPV and Hep B vaccines done at Kaiser and I’m even questioning those needles! I know, crazy..

This is funny because vaccines (for covid) only protect the person who has the vaccine, so why does it matter to advertise it? 

 This is similar to Prep.  PreP only protects the person that has it.  A top on Prep can have sex with a hiv-positive bottom for example, then have sex with another bottom who is not on prep, and transmit the virus from one bottom to the other without contracting it themselves. 

The point of this rant is, that growing up i did hear often that gays are disease spreading deviants.  And when I observe these phenomenon, I can't help but agree to an extent.  

I know people of all sexualities are going to parties now and are done with the pandemic, but it seems that the gays are the ones who rub it in everyone else's faces on social media.  Obviously not all gays, but enough that there is an obvious observable trend."

Apologies as I'm not sure if this is the best place to post this. Does anyone know where the current copay card for teva generic prep is? 

I used to have a link that no longer works, and despite over 2 hours of googling, I can't find anything except their charity foundation.

It used to just be a copay card that would remove most of the cost.

Much appreciated if you know!"

I feel like I’ve tried every avenue and it seems like there’s no way I can get an affordable prescription for Truvada or Descovy. I was on Truvada for about a year two years ago that I received through the health department. With the gilead copay card it was free. I was making much less money at the time. I went off of it for a while because of a relationship but now I think I should go back on. 
I was prescribed Descovy by my general physician. I received the first 30 pills with no co-pay and then I tried to get a refill and it was a full retail price (something like $2000). I definitely cannot afford that so my doctor prescribed truvada (generic) and it came out to $1500! I then called the New York City health department who was very helpful but basically told me that they would not cover me because I make more than $60,000 a year. They also said I might just be in a weird “loophole” bracket that makes too much to get it covered but not enough to be able to afford it… Whatever that means.They sent my information to AHF who has yet to get back to me. Should I give up hope? 
Regardless of my salary, I am still in what is probably the highest risk group. I am a young(ish), black, gay man living in New York City. I feel like I should be able to get this affordably if I want it. Am I out of luck?"

Have any of you got this new one from Laurus Labs? I don’t know if we can trust it to be as effective as Truvada.

- Any side effects?
- Heard or found anything about this specific brand?

I don’t know if I feel as safe as I did while on truvada.

However, I spoke to him about this last time and he was very dismissive of the idea of even getting the tests started or even considering putting me on PREP as he hasn't ""seen much research done on it"" and is skeptical.  His response to me the first time was that I should be fine and safe as long as I'm smart, use protection, and picky my partners wisely.  This wasn't really a good enough answer for me, and being someone who doesn't rush into choices I had spent the previous weeks reading up on the research on PREP and Truvada both, from the published science articles and felt very comfortable starting either, however didn't really know how to bring that up to him.  I also felt that even if I did tell him that I did my reading on it that wouldn't change that fact that he hasn't and would rightfully leave him skeptical still.  Any advice on what to do or how to approach this conversation? 

\*\*\*Additionally, I am very privileged in having very good medical insurance that will cover lots of things for me due to still being on my parents plan (Grad School Student), however the one limitation to that is that my PCP is one of the very few providers in my area that will accept my plan so I don't really have other providers I can go to for a second opinion.

My boyfriend and I have been together in a monogamous relationship for the since August of 2019. He was on PrEP for the first ~6 months, then stopped. We were both tested a few months in to our relationship for HIV and both tested negative. 

Fast forward to last week, he tells me he wants to start taking PrEP again. He claims it’s because we recently started having sex without a condom, but both being negative and in a monogamous relationship strikes me the wrong way. He also says he has no intentions of meeting anyone else and doesn’t want to open the relationship. 

Am I crazy to be a bit skeptical of him wanting to take PrEP in a committed relationship of a couple years? I understand protecting yourself and whatnot, but it seems weird to me. 

I have told him my thoughts, which is just a feeling of discomfort but I’ve not heard of committed partners using PrEP. 

Thoughts? Am I being crazy or is what I’m feeling valid to any extent?



TL;DR
Boyfriend in committed monogamous relationship of two years wants to start PrEP and it makes me feel weird."

I waited untill I felt better and in the afternoon preped myself and went to see him.
I don't know what happened but apparently I was not clean, first time ever not being clean, but I think it was because of my hangover and not eating anything.
Needless to say that he was so annoyed by it, he made me feel like the ultimate scumbag, I even offered to buy him new sheets and I tried to explain to him that I did do my prep but Idk what was wrong. No, my apologies were not enough he chose to humiliate me after I gave my ass to him, not to mention that I was telling him it hurts and he would not stop only if I d take it out myself.

I (M17) am gay, and even though I don't have any plans to have sex with another man in the immediate future, I am concerned about the high risk I have of getting HIV, should I want to do so. I'm out to everyone in my family except my father, so hopefully, he would be the only roadblock for this; however, I'm also concerned about my mom as even though she's accepting, I don't think she has a sex-positive mindset where I would be allowed to take PrEP, let alone talk to her about considering it.

What should I do? Is this even a safe thing to discuss with her? Or should I not take it at all and wait until I'm older?"

I had a riskier than intended sexual encounter today with a stranger through a website. 

Basically I had told the guy I didn’t want full sex etc and we had agreed it would be oral only. Halfway through he asked if I would like to have a toy used on me, of course the answer to this was yes. 

I was on all fours as he used the toy with lube and he was masterbating while doing it. After a short while he took the toy out and started fingering me. Something felt off so i turned round and realised that he had cum directly on my ass when he took the toy out and had been fingering me which has the consequence of pushing cum inside of me with his fingers. I hadn’t felt it at first in the heat of the moment and with the lube. 

Naturally I was upset by this and left. I’m not out the closet and keep this side of myself very private and was freaking out afterwards about my possibly exposure to sti’s etc. 

Someone I know gave me 4 prep tablets about 3 hours after this. He told me to take 2 immediately, another before bed (about 7 hours later) and to take another in 24 hours.

That being said, is there a cheaper or easier solution?

However, I work healthcare and don’t always have the drive to meal prep to add some of this stuff in to what I could take to work, and that’s assuming I’ll even get enough of a break to have it.

While it's not the only reason I avoid sex fear of HIV and STIs is one of the main reasons I choose to avoid it outside of a relationship. I feel like taking Prep might allow me to loosen up a bit and make ""friends"" more easily.

At the same time prep doesn't prevent against herpes etc and even the curable ones are still an annoyance. I also hate doctors, needles etc so a doctors appointment every three months isn't very appealing.

Anyway just curious if anyone else has been in a similar dilemma. If it were like popping a Claritin I'd just do it but with the potential side effects and required doc appointments I'm not sure that the peace of mind outweighs the risks for someone like me."

The reason I find this worrying is because HIV came on set and nobody knew what it was or why gay men were more exposed to it. Suddenly you had all these people dying from a new disease that had never been heard or seen of before.

It makes me wonder if this could happen again and the fact that a lot of gay men have just stopped using condoms full stop because they’re on prep is actually very dangerous when you think about it. If a disease like HIV was to ever plague the gay community again I can’t help but feel it would spread like wildfire given the general attitude from some guys these days that they don’t need to use condoms anymore because they have prep.

So I’m 25, and up until about a month or 2 ago I had long and extremely thick hair, like almost too thick (go ahead, chuckle). It runs in my family.. hair dressers always joke about it with us (us = mom, dad, bro &amp; me). No real history of hair loss in my family, even my grandmother has a thicker head of hair than most people I think. 

I grew my hair out during corona, I haven’t got a haircut in over a year and a half so its gotten pretty damn long. That probably makes it sound like it looked bad but it really looked so fuckin good, I got compliments on it all the time. 

Fast forward to around April, I had a little STD scare with a partner I was with, it turned out to be nothing but my doctor and I decided to put me on prep as a precaution. 

Shortly after starting that, my partner moved away, and I got really busy with work and I haven’t had sex with anyone since. So for about a month I was half-assed taking my prep because I didn’t really need it and I wasn’t used to taking it every day yet. I’d take it once every couple of days when I’d remember too. This was when I first noticed my hair was coming out a bit more often than usual. I didn’t really think anything of it though. And I definitely didn’t connect it to the new medication. My college roommate had long hair and we’d find his hair everywhere so I just figured it was more noticeable since my hair was longer. 

Fast forward again to about a month ago, I figured I might as well start taking the PrEP everyday, it’s what was told to do so why not. I set an alarm on my phone to go off every day to remind me to take it and I did. 

I didn’t make the connection at the time but right after I started taking my prep daily, my hair started to fall out an a rate that started to worry me. It wasn’t giant clumps or anything like that but I couldn’t touch my head without multiple strands of hair coming out in my hand. Literally every time i touched my hair. It didn’t matter how often I’d touch my hair, or where I touched it, or how lightly I touched it… if I touched my hair, or if something touched my hair, hair would get left behind. 

This worried me but my hair was so thick it wasn’t really an issue, it didn’t look or feel any different really, the only noticeable change was that there was hair everywhere. 

After about 3 weeks of taking the prep everyday it got very noticeable though. I could start seeing my scalp more anywhere my hair parted. The hair loss wasn’t happening in a specific place, it was happening all over my entire head. I noticed that my hair felt half as full as it normally did. Before I took prep, if I grabbed all my hair in my hand, like grip it, my thumb and index finger would hardly touch, now when I did that, my entire thumb would overlap  my index finger. A TON of volume gone. I was still taking the prep daily, I didn’t think it was the cause since it wasn’t a side effect of the specific medication. 

This all escalated until about a week ago when I took a shower and there was here everywhere, I mean EVERYWHERE. The floor, walls, soap bottles, me, everything. I broke down and started freaking out a little. After the shower I sat down and wrote down everything that’s changed in my life since I started noting the hair loss.. there have been some other changes in my life, like I said I was getting really busy with work, my dad said it could be stress but I wasn’t stressed about work at all…. The only major difference in my life was that I started taking prep. I stopped taking it that day and called my doctor the next. He told me it wasn’t a side effect of the medication but it could be the cause and that I should stop taking it and see if it helps.

So now here I am, about a week off prep, the hairless hasn’t completely gone away but it has slowed down pretty drastically I think. I must have lost like 70% of my hair volume. Thankfully my hair was very long and thick (go ahead, chuckle again) to begin with, and the hairloss was all over my head not in one specific place so it’s not very noticeable. It’s like a bit less than an average head of hair but like if you saw me out on the street you wouldn’t think I was suffering from hair-loss, thank god. But I notice it so much, my head is lighter, grabbing my hair doesn’t feel right.. it does take less time to wash now though lol. 

I just wanted to share this story with you all. My doctor hasn’t yet confirmed it was the cause but I think it’s pretty safe to say it was. 

I looked a lot into this issue and there isn’t much information about it, I only found one Reddit post talking about Prep causing hair loss. 

Has anyone else had this issue? 

Does anyone have any advice? 

Will my thick hair come back 🥺? 

I guess only time will tell, wish me luck boys! And thank you for listening :)"

My partner and I discussed it and he was ok with me meeting someone together with him Anyway, I have some prep but I don’t actually take it because I’m normally in a monogamous relationship so I don’t need it but I had some just for situations like this. Yesterday my partner asked me if I felt like meeting someone because It is my birthday in a couple of days and I said yes. We downloaded Grindr and I found someone soon after. We met up that night and I let him top me without a condom. Ordinarily I wouldn’t let him do that but because I had my prep on me I thought it would be ok. My doctor told me about taking 2 pills before sex and then 1 pill for the next 2 or 3 days. I guess I misunderstood because when I looked online to make sure it said you need to take the 2 pills 24 hours before.

I already took the 2 pills last night immediately after the sex but now I’m worried because I’m wondering if it won’t be effective. Im actually on vacation right now in Spain and getting access to PEP is proving to be a huge pain. I asked the guy today when his last test was and he said it was in June and negative. He also didn’t cum inside me but there was some blood after I went to the bathroom. I’m thinking of just continuing to take the prep pills for the next few days and using this as a lesson to plan better in future.

Anyway, do you think I really need pep or do you think taking the prep for the next few days will suffice. Remember that I took 2 pills immediately after the sex. Thanks in advance."

So I’ve been on prep for a week and a half and had no symptoms up until yesterday. During the day and especially at night I was feverish, headaches, chills, muscle aches, light sensitive.

For context, I’m a total top and had a condom protected encounter the day I started prep. I tested negative a few days before starting prep and had an unprotected encounter a couple weeks before that negative test date.

That means every day, preferably at the same time. Miss a day, or two, or worse, a few or more, and your protection goes down.  From when you start PreP, you don’t have full immunity with it until after 7 days of correctly (continuously) taking it so if you fuck raw before then, you’re exposing yourself to HIV too. 

Secondly, PreP’s protection, **is only for HIV**. There are other very nasty STD’s out there that really, I don’t know why more people don’t care about them. Some of them are very serious and you can’t tell if someone has an STD just by looking at them. Condoms provide a certain, visual/peace of mind barrier between you and a potential STD - PreP doesn’t for STDs other than HIV.

I have a friend who got on PreP, knew he would go barebacking everyone that wanted to, and the poor thing tested positive for gonorrhoea, he found out after getting tested after using the toilet was painful….. he never felt more regretful.

I get that bareback feels better emotionally and physically. But do carefully think about the consequences your actions in the bedroom could have… PreP is probably a better second line of defence, as nothing beats the visual peace of mind and safety that is condoms"

a) does it matter/make much of a difference that I'll be using different brands of PrEp? 

b) will the side effects be more or less the same/or worse? (Ik nobody can predict that until I actually take it but I'm curious. 

c) i recently made a decision to refrain from having (casual) sex with strangers and hold out for a monogamous relationship with someone who values me for more than just my body. i asked my doc if it makes sense to keep taking PrEP if i have no intention/desire to be sexually active and she said that the drugs take like a week or so to work and if i stop my body will need to get readjusted so if youre an impulsive person (which i am) its better to be prepared just in case you change your mind 2 weeks later and want to be eiffel towered by two guys u met on grindr or smth (well she didnt say that exactly but the sentiment remains the same). but what do u think tho? keep taking them or stop until i decide to have sex again? 🤔"

To be honest i already have anxiety and low key depression. Maybe low T.

I had similar side effects years ago when I got the post exposition treatment which is truvada + one more med.

I would really like to continue the prevention treatment as PreP is a fantastic opportunity to enjoy meeting guys without guilt / after thought (you probably get what I mean). It’s also important as my best friend died of AIDS a few years ago. He thought HIV was a conspiracy… and that vitamins was all he needs.

I admittedly like barebacking with strangers so little that I am approaching a point where it will likely become an automatic dealbreaker in the future.

I started Prep last month after being off for a year and had nausea dizziness etc for 4 weeks or so that then went away completely. But then my script ran out and took a while to get refilled. I just restarted a couple days ago and I feel like the nausea and GI issues are coming back and I’m worried it’s gonna be another 4 weeks of readjusting. I know everyone’s body is different but figured I’d ask if anyone who had side effects has done this and how it went.

Bit of a serious topic, I was with a guy last night and he went to go in BB lubed up but I said “no I don’t do BB”, he then put a condom on, we took a quick break, I seen he had the condom on before we resumed, then I decided I wanted to go home and so we stopped I turned around and he had no condom on, he said he had just taken it off but I had not heard. Anyway I left, messaged him, he sent a photo of him with PREP (date of dispense 30 July 2021) and said that he didn’t fuck me without a condom. 

Just wanted to know whether anyone else thinks it would be best to get PEP? In a foreign country currently so trying to locate. 

Does anyone who takes PREP have the expiration for their most recent dose? (his said “Discard after 07/30/2023”)

TLDR: Anyone who has gotten PREP, when does it expire?"
