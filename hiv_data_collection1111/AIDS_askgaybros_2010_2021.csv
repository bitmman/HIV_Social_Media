So thanks again!


Please help me here, I think/know this is an utterly unsafe practice. However I cannot easily find a credible resource that states the risk of this particular practice explicitly. Most state the higher HIV risk in homosexual male sex broadly.

To clarify: he believes it is only if you are analy penetrated by an HIV+ man, that you are at risk. Whereas he himself as HIV-, is at no risk penetrating whomever anally. This is notwithstanding that South Africa has amongst the highest AIDS rates!

Any links explicitly addressing all the differing manners, in specific detail, that HIV can be transmitted in male homosexual sex is most appreciated. I am very thankful for this forum as a goto resource.

I recently read this article on the CDC about how gay and bisexual men are at high risk for getting infected with HIV from anal sex.
http://www.cdc.gov/msmhealth/HIV.htm
""2011 study in 20 U.S. cities found that 18% of gay or bisexual men had HIV.""


I was wondering that given this high risk what percentage of gay guys abstain from anal sex all together and choose other forms of intimacy such as oral, handjobs and frotting.

3bl8x2,Is my mother homophobic or AIDS-phobic?,http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/3bl8x2/is_my_mother_homophobic_or_aidsphobic/,[deleted],13,2015-06-29 20:21:10,24,/r/askgaybros/comments/3bl8x2/is_my_mother_homophobic_or_aidsphobic/,NaN,"This is something that's bothered me for a long time. As an adult I still have hang-ups about having sex and dating, and I attribute it to my mother's lack of support. I feel like she's a bit homophobic, but when I told my sister this she did not agree.

I came out 13 years ago when I was 11 as gay, as for the most part my mother was supportive. She tried attending PFLAG and brought me to my first Pride. We watched some movies together and even bought me some gay-teen books. She loves Will&amp;Grace and The L Word (but hated Queer as Folk for the sexual content), and seems to have no problems with other people being gay. For the most part it seemed fine. But as I got older and more sexually aware things seemed to change.

She always told me about how all gay men are promiscuous and we get STIs and HIV, etc. She agrees with the ban on gay blood/ organ donations in Canada, where we live. She forbade me from dating and having sex in high school, saying that I was only allowed to do that when I was 18 and moved out. She sometimes claims that she doesn't want me having sex because she thinks I'll get HIV, and that she saw how bad it was first hand working as a nurse in the '80s, so she's protecting me.

I tried dating and having sex, but she has been incredibly judgemental. After I had my first sexual experience when I was 12 (and I felt guilty for what I did and confessed to her) she called me a slut and has since regarded me as promiscuous despite me having little sex due to feeling incredibly guilty about being sexually active. I introduced her to a few guys I've dated and even let one sleep over (I live with my mom temporarily) because he drank too much and I lived closer. After that she yelled at me for bringing him into our house and that I was treating her home as a brothel. She tried to make me feel guilty because we live in a semi-detached house and she doesn't want our neighbours hearing me with guys over.

The thing is she has been supportive of my sister dating. She's straight and has always had boyfriends ever since she was 13. My mother even drove them to dates and let the guy stay over late, hanging out in the basement or my sister's room. It was quite obvious what they were doing, but my mother turned a blind eye or always welcomed them into our house. My sister has never had problems introducing her many boyfriends to her, but I bring over someone and I'm treating her house like a brothel... Whenever I leave she asks me judgingly with a lowered voice if I'm going out to meet a guy or just going to the coffee shop to read. I don't date and she consistently makes me feel bad about wanting to date.

As an adult I have a lot of hang-ups about sex and dating, feeling guilty or that she would disapprove. At some point I'd like to have something serious, but I don't want to introduce him to her because of how she'll react. I get the impression that she's fine with me being gay provided I don't act on it by actually dating.

Am I wrong? Is she being homophobic or just sex-negative/ being concerned I'll get HIV? I'm not sure how to handle her or what to do. I want to feel fine having sex with people and having a proper relationship but she's just ruined me for it.

(She also has NPD traits)."

What I do know is that my partner of 14 years died of AIDS at age 43.  Although it was a complicated relationship,  we stuck together. 
For the last 8 years,  we lived together in Manhattan as ""family"" without sex.   He ended the sex part with me,   and I found it distressing and sad.    We basically lived together because of real estate---!!   but continued to care for &amp; love each other.

I only learned about the crystal meth &amp; coke after he died when I found some in his personal papers,  with a dealer's name and telephone number as well.   I immediately threw it away,  and have never mentioned a word to anyone.

I suspected some drug use,  but I thought it was ""harmless"" ecstasy.


We were a preppy, affluent white couple with a big 2 bedroom preWar apartment in Manhattan.  He would sometimes go to Miami or Palm Springs on his own or with his friends for 10 days or longer. 
I was never part of his travel group,  and I was never invited bc of my work obligations, etc.

He was a hard working,  successful star in his professional field,  but also  had a terrible temper,  body image issues,  and frustration with peers/bosses/life.   There were times when he would rage,   some times when he wouldn't return home for a night.    But I never suspected meth/coke.   And he actively deceived me when I asked what kind of drugs he was taking.

What I am trying to imagine,  or figure-out,  is WHAT happens at these ""Circuit"" parties,  and late night debaucheries?  a huge denial of safe-sex FACTS,   and general sense of wellness----in exchange for what?  a fast hot dick up the bum?

A lot of guys go through this sexed up 30s-40s when they have the money to travel &amp; play.   So this should be relevant to you 20-somethings who think this could never happen to you.

(re his death,  he was diagnosed in Feb and died 7 months later.  He lived in denial for so long,  that when he was diagnosed it was too late.  Nothing could save him.   These things still happen,  it's not over by a long shot)
(PS-  I found love 7 months after his death.  It's taken  a long time to sort through, and I can never forget the horror of it,  but there is a new chapter to my life)

I made a throwaway account to ask y'all about this. I've already posted this is r/gay and r/lgbt but haven't gotten much response. I'm really conflicted and I'd love some advice.

My boyfriend (31) and I (25) have been together for about a year. I love him more than any other guy I've ever been with. No one has ever ""got"" me the way he gets me. 

I've had to become his only support system after he has essentially closed himself off from his abusive and manipulative family members. He lives with me, I helped him get a job at the place I work, and we both share my car for driving to work. None of this I really have an issue with, because I want him to succeed and do well.

For the first year of our relationship, we have always used condoms. 

I have asked him to get tested a few times.

About 6 months ago, he moved in with me and my roommate. Our sex life sort of dwindled for the next few months. We talked about it several times but it never really got back to the way it was at first. Which is normal I guess. 

About 3 months ago, he started having really bad headaches. Ended up going to the hospital about 3 weeks ago when his vision was affected. Was diagnosed with not just HIV, but full on AIDS. The headaches were caused by a brain infection (toxoplasmosis) as a result of his lowered immune system. 

I was tested that night and it came back negative. The last time we had sex was about a month before the test and it was protected. I'm pretty sure I've dodged the bullet but they want me to get tested once more just to be sure.

Even before his diagnosis, we had talked about what we would do. I decided I would be okay with going on PrEP and staying by his side.

Well, the diagnosis has happened, and we're still wading through the post-diagnosis stage. My boyfriend doesn't have insurance so he hasn't been able to get on a stable medication regimen yet. 

Also, we share a car (my car) and work separate shifts at the same company, where I got him a job. So in the morning, he drives me to work, takes the car, comes back at 3 to start his shift, I leave at 5 and take the car, then I come back at midnight to pick him up. Imagine doing that--it's very exhausting. Especially because we work 6 days a week. 

I'm just starting to feel like I've compromised and given and given all I can. I've had to put my dreams on the back burner to care for him, look out for him, be his savior in all these situations. It's just getting frustrating because though I know he appreciates it, I'm not sure if he's aware JUST how unhappy I am right now. I'm not sure how to talk about it because I'm a very accommodating person who has the instinct to hide my feelings. 

I'm having all sorts of ugly thoughts that I don't want to share with him. I'm 25, do I need the burden and stress of caring for an HIV+ boyfriend? Should I be with someone who lifts me up instead of someone I'm constantly having to lift up? Am I being selfish? I feel like all this pressure is on me, to train him at our job and deal with our boss to make sure he keeps his job and does well, to stay by his side through this HIV thing and be a good boyfriend, etc. 

If anyone has any thoughts or words of wisdom please let me know. 

TL; DR: I'm 25, he's 31, together for a little over a year now. I've had to become my boyfriend's only family and support system since he and his family have ceased contact. He's had a hard life and I love him. But it turns out he's had not just HIV, but full AIDS since before we started dating. I begged him to at least get an at-home test a few months after we started dating. We were protected throughout our relationship and I tested negative the night he tested positive. Now I'm wondering why I'm even still in this relationship after all the compromising and giving I've had to do. 

EDIT: I forgot to mention that he is essentially my first long-term boyfriend. All I've had before him was hookups and a short 2-month fling.

* Did gay people, by and large, get tested during this time once they knew of the crisis and started seeing their friends dying? Or was there a ""I don't want to know"" mentality? Similarly...was there a halt in all sexual activity in the gay community? Even kissing, considering we didn't know how the virus transferred?
* Once we learned that women can get HIV, did bisexuals get shunned for ""passing it on"" to women?
* Did Reagan get criticism by anyone outside of the gay community for his inaction, like he does now in hindsight? It was a sweeping epidemic, so whyyyyy did it not come up in the '84 election/debates? What should Reagan have done differently?"

He went to the doctor multiple times and they couldn't figure out what was wrong. Finally, he got so sick that I took him to the emergency room. This was a month ago. The doctor in the emergency room ordered an HIV test without asking him and it came back positive. My mind was blown. He had told me that at one of the doctor visits a week ago, they gave him a test and it was negative. I didn't ask him to get a test when we stopped using condoms because he told me he was tested three months before we met. We lived together for 1.5 years. I just didn't understand how this could be true. The next day I got the bill from that doctor's visit and there was no charge for a test. I later found out that he actually declined an HIV test and told the doctor he had been recently tested. At this point, I start to get suspicious so I spent several hours looking through his phone. I saw the most disgusting things you can imagine. My hands shook as I looked. I found out he cheated on me with strangers from Craigslist, traded dirty pics with guys he worked with, grabbed a guys junk at a store, and much more. I also found out that he had been to bathhouses before we met. He had told me he had never heard of a bathhouse. He hooked up with guys that had boyfriends on a regular basis before we met. He had even told me he had never had anal sex but there were videos of him getting fucked without a condom. The story just gets worse.  I recently found out that he infected an ex boyfriend. The ex said he assumed my boyfriend told me that he is positive. The ex also said that my boyfriend knew he had it when he gave it to him too. Strangely, the ex has forgiven him and they are still friends. Maybe that makes it easier to deal with, but I can't forgive this. I have been through a roller coaster of emotions. Rage. Hatred. Sadness. Empathy. I can understand him being evil and selfish and putting my health at risk, but why he would put his own at risk and not take a pill? I just don't get it. He is still in ICU and I haven't even been able to speak to him because he has been on a vent for the last three weeks. Now that he is off the vent, he has delirium from being in ICU for so long. I feel like I need to talk to him to get closure. He thinks I've been there when I haven't and is very confused. I am told that the confusion will go away when he gets out of ICU. My point of writing this is to warn you all that you can't trust anyone and you should make absolutely sure that person has been tested.  Use condoms.  Always. Get on PrEP.  I don't know how I will ever trust anyone again. 

Edit:  I forgot to add that I am negative.  We haven't had sex in four months.  I took two OraQuick and one blood test. Thank god he is a bottom. Also, we didn't have sex much.  That was the only problem I had with our relationship.  Now I think he might have been trying to protect me.  So strange.  "

Trump and the GOP will soon have control over all 3 branches of government - The White House, both houses of Congress, and the Supreme Court. One of the most notable goals of both the GOP and Donald Trump is to eliminate the Affordable Care Act (ACA) (""Obamacare"") and to defund / eliminate Planned Parenthood. With nearly no checks and balances on him or his party, Donald Trump will have the power to achieve these goals.

Let's discuss: What are the public health implications on our community?

Many gay men rely on public services like Planned Parenthood for subsidized sexual health testing and care.

With Obamacare gone, there will no-longer be consumer protection against pre-existing conditions discrimination. Could gays be discriminated by the health care industry?  Could HIV-positive gay men lose their current health care? Will we now lose PrEP?

Could the anti-gay goals of such an administration lead to a gay public health crisis and a nationwide [HIV outbreak like we saw in Indiana under then Governor Mike Pence](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-pence-indiana-hiv_us_57f53b9be4b002a7312022ef)?'

5fakwt,The 80s AIDS epidemic reading materials and programs to watch,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/5fakwt/the_80s_aids_epidemic_reading_materials_and/,drazzy92,6,2016-11-28 00:15:19,22,/r/askgaybros/comments/5fakwt/the_80s_aids_epidemic_reading_materials_and/,NaN,"A few months ago I was browsing Netflix when I came across ""We Were Here,"" and I though to myself ""Hey, I'm obsessed with educational shows and I've never really looked into AIDS!"" My. God. In the beginning when Ellen says, ""Unfortunately, none of these guys are alive today"" I knew I was in for a wild ride. This was less of an educational program and more of an emotional one. When Daniel describes his best friend Peter's last night before he committed suicide literally shattered my heart into a million pieces on a level that I have never experienced before in my life. 

I cried so hard and even hours later it still hurt, and then suddenly something inside of me sparked, and I became intensely obsessed with the 80's AIDS epidemic. This fixation/obsession is something I've never really experienced before. I watched every single episode, movie, read all the free stuff on it that I could find. I literally devoured everything about the 80s AIDS epidemic. 

I even went as far as to contact some people from We Were Here and How to Survive a Plague and I feel sort of dumb about it because I didn't realize at the time that talking about these experiences wouldn't be inspirational memories of being heroic AIDS advocates taking on the evil politicians like Reagan, but painful memories of losing friends left and right. I eventually came across Garance Franke-Ruta's article discussing How to Survive a Plague. 

&gt; ""But life on the other side of the knowledge of life and death meant also that by the time I was 21 I had seen and felt and experienced so much I became convinced that if I had to process one more thing —one more awful thing—I would just keel over and die.""

And 

&gt; I've written only one reflection on that era previously, for a book a decade ago; it took me two months to squeeze out about 1,200 words, because every time I turned to the subject I either developed such a colossal headache I had to stop, or burst into tears.

And these quotes really put it in perspective for me. I'm a journalist, which is why I reached out to them. It was going to be some kind of freelance work that I was going to do for my own personal leisure. I still just can't shake this obsession so I was wondering if any ""veterans"" know of some good materials I could read or watch? I plan on focusing a project or two in University on this subject. 

EDIT: In hindsight it was stupid of me not to write out a list of what I've already read/watched. I've watched the Normal Heart, How to Survive a Plague, And the Band Played On (the novel as well), We Were Here, Longtime Companion. Holding the Man, and a bunch of other obscure movies on it. I guess I'm looking for something like How to Survive a Plague because I might major in Chemistry, and I was really interested in the pharmaceutical nature of the show. 

I guess I'm just curious if anyone here knows of any really obscure good materials on this topic. I've pretty much watched and read everything that you can find on google. "

I just found out that one of my closest former-church mate/ friend is dying of AIDS and my folks were gossiping about it. I heard my mom said ""I knew he was gay"" although it is not a confirmed theory. My dad thought so too and then quipped "" /user/dcruz102 better be the one doing the fucking"" (jesting- in Filipino). Though my homosexuality is acknowledge and accepted, there is still an overwhelming amount of ignorance about it not only in my family, but as I see, in the whole society. The last straw was when my mom casually asked me and my boyfriend in public if we have AIDS (was she really that awkwardly ignorant!?!). I really got furious and almost confronted them (we were in a very public place- a restaurant). I told them ""HIV/ AIDS is not a Gay-only Disease"". I was really embarrassed for my boyfriend (I can't believe he left San Diego for this shit drama). 

I'm really really sad right now about my friend. I'm blaming a lot of things. Like the educational system constantly getting interfered by stupid Filipino Catholic clergies who have a medieval mindset who always make safe sex education big deal in schools. Just because you are celibate, does not mean we have to be celibate too, you fucking losers! And also the politicians who cowardly succumbed to clergy power. Well guess what! There is no such thing as a Catholic vote, imbeciles!

I also learned that my friend already knew 3 years ago that he was positive and hid it from his family. He did not seek treatment and the virus progressed like a wildfire throughout the years. That was the time when we spent a ""born-again"" retreat together. I remembered there was an anti-gay/ homo talk at the retreat. That memory really gets in to me since his brother came out too at that time. I wish he told me and we could have gotten advice from Research Institute of Tropical Medicine. I heard ARV are provided free-of-charge. Is there any chance to prolong his life? or improve the quality of life? I'm still yet to see him this week. :(

There's so a lot in my mind right now. Sorry for the rant and sadness dudes.

&gt;[While MSM are disproportionately affected by HIV, syphilis, and other STDs, health activists from the gay community have systematically resisted the application of the full range of public health strategies traditionally used to prevent their spread. In the more than three decades since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, there have been substantial advances in testing and treatment, yet the infection rate among MSM, and particularly young MSM, remains high, even as it has been dropping among other risk groups.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4034619/) 


A 1986 study of MSM in New York City found that 49.6 percent had not changed their behavior (Feldman 1986). A 1987 study found that 67 percent of MSM admitted engaging in anal intercourse without condoms during the previous year. Many of those who initially adopted safer sex practices failed to persist:

It appears, then that some of the factors associated with continued participation in high-risk sexual behavior are resistant to current educative intervention. Educational campaigns, however well executed and well intentioned, have been insufficient to stem the spread of HIV infections. (Jones et al. 1987)

Gay AIDS activists insisted that AIDS education must be sex positive, avoid moralizing, and not distinguish between those who were HIV positive and those who were HIV negative (Odets 2004). **The gay AIDS establishment defended the right of infected persons to remain ignorant of their condition and the right of infected persons to conceal their contagious condition from others, including sexual partners and healthcare personnel.** They wanted gay bathhouses kept open, arguing that they could be places to impart prevention education, and distribute condoms"

* *AIDS doesn't exist anymore. A person was diagnosed with AIDS if their antibodies were under 200 and they had an opportunistic infection. Nowadays, with medication, people with (and lower than) that level of antibodies have managed to beat opportunistic infections. So does that mean they were cured of AIDS and are now only HIV +? No.*

* *If an HIV + person who is taking therapy has unprotected sex with someone and bodily fluids like semen are exchanged, the odds of the partner getting HIV are as low as getting it from saliva, so extremely low.*

Those two things sort of stood out. Has there been new research to verify this? Because the guy strongly felt that PrEP and PEP had a 100% success rate, and seemed very adamant on people not using the word 'AIDS' anymore. 

Good thing though is that therapy is covered by your insurance if you're HIV +,  a thing I didn't expect from such a conservative country I (sadly) call home.

Thank you all in advance!"

""A man-made disease—approved by congress—was created in a laboratory and introduced into the gay community in the mid 1970s.

The disease was intended to scare gay men and reduce the number of practicing homosexuals in society.

At the same time, it was also introduced into Africa in order to control the poor black population there.""

***What we do know***

1. The development of a man-made virus was discussed in Congress in 1969

2. The government recruited gay men in New York beginning in 1974—and later San Francisco and Los Angeles—to participate in a hep B vaccine program

3. Gay men were injected with the vaccine in 1978 through 1979.
The first officially recognized AIDS case in the U.S. was reported in 1980—San Francisco resident Ken Horne

4. By 1985 66% of the men in the original trial tested HIV positive"

I am making this post because yesterday I realized we still have along way to go to eradicate this disease. I also realized that how we as a community view sex is alil problematic.

There could also be special therapy where the guy goes to bed with a cute guy in a dark room, then, the woman slips in to the bed and the cute guy slips out of the room. This would be like an exposure therapy. Gradually, the guy would spend less time with the cute guy and more time with the woman.

I’ve also thought about a costume man suit for a woman to wear, but I think it would only work if it were of a really muscly man.

It is outrageous that such a tiny part of the population contributes more than half of new STI/STD cases throughout the Western world. Rampant promiscuous sex continues to be one of the most striking, distinguishing features of ""gay"" life. Data gathered before the AIDS crisis in a 1978 study, confirmed 28% of homosexuals had had sexual encounters with 1000 or more partners. Furthermore, 79% said more than half of their sex partners were strangers. Only 1% of the sexually active homosexuals had had fewer than five lifetime partners. Almost half of the white homosexuals said that they had had at least 500 different sexual partners during the course of their homosexual careers. Researchers later described sexual behavior among gays as ""an average several dozen partners a year” and “some hundreds in a lifetime” with “tremendous promiscuity"". In the early 1980s, Center for Disease Control researchers were shocked by the sheer number of sexual partners reported. 


Results from these studies remain consistent to this day. There is no reason to think such behavior has subsided, particularly since who they are in their own minds is largely defined by what they do. In fact, a column by a young writer in a New York Magazine a few years ago celebrated his discovery of the easy anonymous sex he found at truck stops. Since part of the compulsion of homosexuality seems to be a need on the part of the homophile to “absorb” masculinity from his sexual partners, gays must constantly be on the lookout for new partners.

Want me to think about ""raising a family"", and being a ""leader"" than fulfilling sexual/romantic desire. What do you think?**

*Context - can skip if you want*

\- Have always been attracted sexually and romantically to guys since the age of 10. Have been interested by some girls in the past, particularly last year when I fell for a girl, this was during a 55day streak on NoFap, which I undertook to the belief that porn can change your sexuality - watched a lot of gay porn from the age of 12 (because the excitement I had from watching it trumped straight porn by miles) but was attracted to guys way before I got into porn. Basically, during the challenge, I pushed myself to ask out girls - in the mindset of beating a challenge, always desiring the ""no"" rejection way more than a ""yes"", because rejection builds me up. This is the mindset I had on NoFap, and ended up asking out several girls, yet when I thought about gay sex, the sexual frustration was overwhelming.

\- Wasn't until this year, that I considered I was bisexual or even gay, went to see a therapist to help me understand what was actually going on, and was told directly that porn doesn't change sexuality, but rather shows your inner sexual desires, and to abstain masturbation, you are affecting your natural sexual drive.

*Title* 

**Therefore, looked back on my life, on the romantic and sexual attraction I've felt for guys before I did for any girls and came out to my parents last Friday night as gay, and they were just shell shocked.** At first they were supportive and listened intuitively, but the next day they drilled me with their responses, saying that choosing to go down the ""gay path/lifestlye"" is a decision, and that if I did that I wouldn't be able to have a family, which is what my parents believe is the reason we are on earth, to reproduce. Had a big talk today about it as well, them telling me that they believed I was a leader, and ""leader"" by their definition is someone who makes a family. This, I can agree upon, however, I argued one cannot be a leader if they are not true to themselves, and they keep drilling me on how despite my homosexual desires, I should think about a wife, and raising children.

&amp;#x200B;

They then talk about how gay people live lonely lives. They have both had careers in the entertainment industry during the 80's so saw lots of gay people, who by their perception fed their loneliness with promiscuity and all have Aids now. They say that to come out as ""gay"" is to go down the road of meaningless sex and never come out of it with a meaningful relationship and get aids. **This is worrying me as I don't won't this to happen to me**, although I am fine with the idea of sex, I want to find that special person and don't want AIDS. We went really deep into sex, which was also really weird, dad talking about how if some guy does anal on me then cuts the skin, everytime I shit, I get it infected - **is this true!???**

Basically alot of, ""whatever you do don't do anal sex"", which as a virgin, I was planning on doing, so I could know 100% that im gay. They want me to ""try sex with a girl you may like it"", which may be true, but I don't believe it'll erase my homosexual desires, or even be better than gay sex.

&amp;#x200B;

\---- Basically, they're having a really hard time coming to terms with it, and that's fine, it's just I need your opinions on what they say - **Are most gay guys lonely? Are we guaranteed to get aids? What do you/ did you think about making a biological family - do you want one or want to adopt? Have your parents ever reacted in a similar way?**

**Just need some help as I don't really know where to go from here.** Parents are telling me ""think about it..."" they know I'm attracted emotionally and physically to guys, but ""the family is more important..."". I believe that I'm gay, but everytime they talk to me it's like I'm feeling ashamed of who I am. **Yes, maybe I'm bi, maybe a wife will come along, but maybe it's not up to me?**

The thing is... I don't like anal sex though. I find it rather gross since that's where poop comes out of. However, the things that I *do* like is men and their dicks. That's as simple as I can put it, lol. Apparently they think that in order to be gay, you MUST like anal sex, which is like... far from the truth."

My post was about PrEP and the importance of continuing to wear a condom and for some reason, that triggered a lot of people and I'm confused as to why.

In my post, I said 6 people who have complied with PrEP have become infected with HIV and that being on PrEP does not make you bulletproof and that condoms should still be applied for safety purposes. That's the short version of my post. I just want to know where I went wrong so I'm more careful in the future, but unfortunately, I cannot get that information from my usual sub because everyone there is being very rude and aggressive.

I use to get really annoyed by these post but lately I have been thinking that this really indicates a lack of sexual education, especially related to sex between two men in our public schools.  And also a lack of resources for college aged guys.

 We have older teens and even college aged guys thinking they got HIV from getting a bj or having someone cum in their mouth.  They have no resources or education on High risk vs low risk activities.  No idea that a regular testing schedule is need when you are sexually activity or where to get said test.

So not as much of a question as a rant.  And the fact Im going to try and be less annoyed and more helpful with these types of post.

For context, I will be getting an HIV test next week. 

I'm a gay man who tops. I haven't gotten an HIV test in 7 years. Most if not all the time I use condoms while having sex. There were a couple of partners that I regularly had unprotected sex with but they were HIV negative. There were a probably 2-3 instances where I might've had sex with someone and didn't know their status and it was probably 5 years ago. I know I was reckless and stupid. 

Recently, I was diagnosed with an Anxiety disorder and was perscribed with Lexapro 10mg. Right before I was diagnosed, I was feeling all sorts of physical symptoms and pains and also breathing problems. Recently, I've felt random pain on the right side of my body , particularly on the right side of my chest but it seems like it's going away. Also previously had some pain in the right kidney area that went away. 

My breathing has somewhat gotten better by the day thanks to Lexapro. Recently as of today, I spotted this on my tounge Oral thrush? https://imgur.com/a/mMNJ0WT . Also recently, I did a blood test and found my White Blood Cell count is at 8.9 10E3/mcL and RBC count at 4.85 10E6/mcL and have Vitamin D deficiency at 19ng/mL (for context, I work in an office with no sunlight whatsoever 40hrs a week).

[NHS - HIV and AIDS: what are the risks for gay men?](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/sexual-health/hiv-and-aids-what-are-the-risks-for-gay-men/) - the UK's National Health Service giving you a basic overall view of the need-to-knows

I know there are a lot of questions concerning about Aids in this sub, however I am worried sick and I would like some answers. I recently had a hookup with a guy. We used condoms for anal and did everything safe. However I gave him a short blow job from about 30 seconds. The part that I am scared of is that my lips where very chapped and I noticed afterwards I had some bleeding. This worries me deeply and I can't feel safe anymore. I know the risk with oral is low and maybe even non-existent. However with those cuts on my lips the chances of contracting Aids are a lot higher isn't it? 

Should I be worried? I will get a check up in a couple of months but I feel like I won't be able to enjoy my stay in Japan now. ( I am studying here as an exchange student.)

He was talking about living with HIV and he said if you have it you have to be very careful with your health because you can get sick extremely easy and you shouldn't even go out with wet hair because you'll get sick. Doesn't AIDS do that? And you get AIDS if you have HIV and don't treat it for a while. Yet he was talking about HIV. From what I know, as long as you take your medication, you can live a normal life with HIV without being that careful. The only thing you shouldn't do is take drugs and drink alcohol and maintain a relatively healthy lifestyle.

It can be confronting to see all those images from the 80s and memories of those who died. We're in a different world now, yet many people still avoid being tested or stigmatise others living with HIV. So I'm (re)posting my updated advice on living and thriving with HIV from someone who's been positive and (now) happy for over a decade.

Think long and hard who you will tell. You don't owe the world, or anyone, an explanation, and you can't untell. You don't need to be a flag waving advocate to have value. 

Don't be afraid to change doctor. There's some nice ones and not nice ones out in the world, don't suffer for no reason. 

When new and better pills come out think about changing. Upgrading your treatment is your right, and it can have significant benefits long term. 

Don't get hung up on the numbers. Viral loads can fluctuate from time to time. It's totally normal and you're still undetectable. Anything under 2,000 copies is fine. 

Don't neglect your ""other"" health; from weight to smoking to that ingrowing toenail you never dealt with. You're entire health doesn't revolve around HIV. 

Connect with other positive people in the community and listen to them. There's an enormous gulf between what a doctor tells you and the actual lived experiences of human beings. 

Re-infection isn't real. Not when you're on treatment, anyway. Don't be afraid of sex. If it's nerve wracking at first, go slow or find other HIV positive people to re-learn the ropes with. But you are entitled to an amazing sex life and there's no reason you can't have it. 

Undetectable = untransmittable. There's never been a transmission from an undetectable person. It's a fact. And it's safer than PrEP. 

Treatment is more than a pill, it's acupuncture, mental health therapy, exercise, massage, self-care, etc etc. Don't neglect it or think the semi annual visits to the clinic are all you need to do to take care of yourself. 

You deserve happiness, so cutting out negative people, jobs, family members, or removing yourself from bad situations is always going to be the answer, trust yourself. 

Sometimes love isn't worth it, and sometimes they aren't worth your love. 

If you're being the best version of yourself, or working towards it, you're doing things right. 

If you can, keep a little reserve of pills around. An extra months supply is a nice buffer to have (oh pharmacist I'm going away, next month, can you give me early?). 

Imagine how you want your life to look in 1 or 5 or 10 years time, then work backwards from there. 

You are strong. Stronger than 99% of other people you will meet. Be strong and be fierce in your own way. 

You'll have sex. And better sex, than you EVER did when you were negative. 

And the best thing? You'll never have the anxiety of taking another HIV test again!

Happy living, my fellow HIV+ gaybros!"

I’m working on a young adult novel about a gay couple living in the 1980s, and one of them eventually develops AIDS and dies. My questions are:

1. How long after HIV infection did someone progress to AIDS in the 1980s? Is there a way they may not have known for years they had HIV/AIDS until they’re on their deathbed?

2. How quickly did someone typically die from AIDS in the 80s? Would a disease such as pneumonia be the main cause of someone passing so suddenly? Thanks."

That is, those of us lucky enough to have emerged from the ‘80s and ‘90s with our bodies still intact (for a great many, just barely) but our souls more than ravaged. Did anyone hear the funny little quip making the rounds after the cocktail came out in 1996? “The good news is that I’m not dying. And the *bad news* is that I’m not dying.” Why, one might wonder, would anyone say such a thing? One unmistakable feature of the plague years was the decision of a large number of HIV+ men to drop out of the workforce, to quit their jobs, to get on disability, and to try to enjoy what little time they had left. There seemed little point to put in the work and invest the energy to advance one’s career with typical delayed-gratification maturity, because everyone knew that our promising careers (and everything else in our lives) would soon to be over. There seemed little point to plan for the future, as any normal adult naturally would. There seemed little point to save money or prudently invest for a better day, because that day was surely never coming. There seemed little point to think of anything but the present moment, which in any case was riddled with constant caregiving of those just a little worse off with that miserable malady of ours, and sullied by our chronic fear of what’s to come. So it was not at all uncommon to see guys run up their credit cards as if there was no tomorrow (oh wait, there *wasn’t*) and to live it up until they dropped.

But then came the rude awakening, the *wonderful* news, that we’re not all going to die after all. When they quite suddenly got a new lease on life, so many guys found themselves living on meager disability payments barely covering everyday expenses (and precious little else), residing in Section 8 apartments they could hardly stand, and pretty much unemployable given the many years they had been out of the workforce or had not worked at all. My friend Kim, well over 40 by that time, simply couldn’t bring himself to work in an entry-level position with nineteen and twenty year-olds and kept hoping he could pull off a miracle and land a higher-ranking job just as he had before— a miracle that never came. So he did nothing. I’ve met quite a few guys like Kim in HIV support groups I’ve attended: not working, horribly impoverished, barely making enough to keep themselves afloat in today’s unaffordable urban scene, suffering from physical ailments caused by prolonged side-effects of the HIV drugs, wanting to start anew but convinced that it’s far too late to even try, tired and hopeless and lacking ambition for something *(anything)* to brighten up their lives. Welcome to a large proportion of long-term survivors of the AIDS years. Welcome to a large proportion of what’s left of my generation. Welcome to the despondent “heroes” we all celebrate in theory but ignore in practice.

As for me, I didn’t fall into debt and for some reason didn’t completely give up on my future. I went to school and got a Ph.D during that frightful time. But I was still adversely affected by the fatalism. I wanted to write a book on something that enthralled me, and I focused almost exclusively on that instead of my future career. I never strategized with my professors on how to best land a job because I assumed that I probably wouldn’t be needing one. I just wanted to write that book before I croaked, and, to my ever-lasting joy, I was able to do it. So once I graduated I didn’t get a great academic job that I perhaps could have gotten had I been more strategic and spent more time networking, but I was (and am) in a much better position career-wise and financially than are so many HIV+ guys of my generation.

Likewise, the fatalism quite assuredly affected me in my personal life. I put up (and then some) with an abusive, sociopathic boyfriend because I fatalistically thought that no one else would have me. (Who in their right mind, I thought, would in the mid-1990s take on another relationship with an HIV+ person after having watched so many die??) I gladly gave him more and more money because, let’s be honest, *I* wasn’t going to need it. (I didn’t fully realize that I was a slow-progressor and genetically more resistant to the virus until the very end of the 1990s.) So, even though I’m far more fortunate than are so many guys who are stuck in horrible poverty and bored with their lives, I’m still right there with them with my own adverse effects of having lived through the plague years. My soul is just as ravaged as theirs.

But not for much longer! I’ve had it up to here with wasting my time and energy on past regret and I’m eager to celebrate my being alive! This year, I’m happy to tell you, is going to be *a wild ride* as I embark on a sexual/romantic comeback that will put the poets to shame— a comeback ever so enhanced by my renewed muscular, slim body. I now weigh, I’m proud to report, under 180 lbs. for the first time in twenty-five years, only a few pounds away from my long-term goal of 175— and that’s with all those newly shaped, weighty muscles [I’ve been working so hard to get this past year](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskGaybrosOver30/comments/dlry8m/its_been_a_full_year_since_i_started_working_out/).

But I need some company! I encourage all of my long-term survivor bros (and everyone else out there) to decide not to wait another day, to start working on shedding those pounds and getting back into shape, to come on board and join me on that wild ride, and to never, *never* give up. Because after all we’ve gone through, it’s just not allowed."

I’ve known of Garrett since first grade, never as friends. He was always an asshole. I came out of the closet when I was fourteen back in the late 2000s, and he was one of a few people to legitimately give me shit for it. I remember exactly what he said when he found out (not through me, but multiple people told me said it): “I hope the f*ggot gets AIDS and dies.”

Fast-forward to June 2020. It’s Pride Month, and a really weird one at that. I decided to post a long, educational-but-in-an-inviting way status about the history and meaning of Pride. It gained some traction among friends old and new, almost entirely positive.

Garrett apparently got wind of the post, likely through a friend sharing it, and replied “nobody asked, fruitcake.” I hadn’t had a single thought about this guy in years, yet all the sudden here he is.

I replied “well Garrett, if you didn’t ask why are you here?”

His response: “Just waiting for the eventual day you post about getting AIDS lol. You’re still a pathetic f@g I see.”

So, I ventured to his profile. Yeah....that was a mistake. He had posted memes about shooting protestors. Statuses about the superiority of the white race. Posts about other countries locking gay people up and wishing we could do that in America.

Also, apparently he and his wife had recently given birth to twins.

I really, really wanted to hit him where it hurt because fuck him, he’s a bigot.

So, I decided to respond to him by saying “wow. Well, all I can say is if your children manage to make it past their first year (which I hope they don’t), they are gonna be so goddamn retarded when they grow up, but not as retarded as your fat cunt of a wife for agreeing to reproduce with you in the first place.

A lot of my friends told I was taking it too far and to just block him. But I didn’t want to block him; I wanted to hurt him, and I wasn’t afraid of the consequences.

My parents told me I didn’t change anyone’s mind, I only proved I was willing to be just as bad as him. But how is that possible? He literally thinks I shouldn’t exist. How does me trying to hurt him in the worst way possibly make me as bad as him, someone who is fine with entire groups being wiped off the face of the earth? He’s already trying to hurt me in the worst way possible, so why does it matter that I hurt him in return?

So, even if AITA, does it really matter when he’s such a huge asshole to begin with? Does bullying someone back make me just as bad as the bully, even if they’re basically a Nazi?"

I was pretty sure you couldn't catch AIDS with oral sex, I'm so dumb ! The worst is that I'm used to brushing my teeth before a hook up.

What should I do ? I didn't do anal, just sucked dicks and swallowed cum, I wish I was more educated and knew you could catch AIDS with oral sex too ...."

I had a low risk encounter from having bottomed for someone whose HIV status was unknown 48 hours prior to taking PEP. The condom broke and we pulled out a minute before he started inserting in me again with a new one. We used saliva for both the old broken condom and the newly inserted one back then. He did not cum inside me, but I'm scared the precum might've slipped out in both the old condom and the new one we put because of the saliva. It's also to note that I had a some inconsistent timing in taking my PEP dosages like 3-4 times by like 3-4 hours, but I never actually missed a dose. 

I'm slightly nervous even with all the precautions made with my best efforts, what do you guys think are my chances that I'll come out negative?"

I think I’ve potentially contracted hiv years ago without noticing until now. In mid 2017 I started to make good money, I just turned 20 at the time I didn’t have a gf I wanted to have some quick pussy so I had intercourse with a bunch of prostitute obviously it was protected sex, the condom probably slipped out or was poorly handled not really sure but I know I haven’t kissed them However I took some bj without the condom. 

Anyways my point is that I never took a test or check up since and tbh I never really felt any symptoms like fever, cough etc.. my dick is looking clean no bumps no itching whatsoever. Research says people can go 10 years without symptoms, The only thing I’ve noticed is my back and face, I’ve had “severe” acne ever since. I got acne bumps on my back they never left it just keep flaring up.. the same thing with my face I’m getting zits, abcess cystic bump with thick fluid and hard white pus deep in my cheek chin and nose very disgusting. But wait I noticed it might be a diet problem because my face mostly starts flaring up when I eat chocolate, cookie, cake, cheese, dairy etc those bakery goods. The problem here is that I remember years ago I could eat all type of bakery goods as much as I want without consequences my body never reacted to it and now literally just after eating one piece of chocolate cake or cookie I can already sense my face flaring up after 20min-1h and wake up the next day with white zits and pimple bumps. If my diet is dairy-free/clean my acnee kinda start fading away.

My body is now so sensitive I looked up on google and its say this issue might come from a “leaky gut” and it also say that one of the HIV symptoms is leaky guts.. y’all think I’m infected??  Also for the record since 2017 I haven’t had sex(im fucking horny dho) but I promised myself next time it would only be when I get a gf (not any time soon) not ready to settle yet because I’m kinda busy getting my life together and working on my dreams

She went into telling me that when their parents found out they bought a house right by where he worked so they could see him when he was dying. The parents thought her brother being gay was a choice but accepted him, which for the 1980s was an ally. 

She also told me that people in the 1980s said things like “this was gods way of punishing gays” and her boss said “I don’t want any gays here”. She even lied to her coworkers about her brothers condition and said it was cancer. 

I think the one that almost made me cry was when she said 

“when he was dying he asked if I could lay next to him in the bed. I knew I couldn’t get anything from him and I loved him and never thought less of him because of him being gay or him having AIDS. he’s in a better place”.
