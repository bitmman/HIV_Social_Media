About 3 weeks ago, I met this guy and we got together to ""play.""  We did not have oral sex.  We did not kiss, nor any other contact except we fisted each other.  We used gloves, and used a clean paper towel to transfer lube to our gloves to minimize cross-contamination.  I fisted him, he fisted me.  I did touch his penis for a short time with no gloves when I was fisted by him.  I then fisted him again (again, with gloves) until he ejaculated (on to a towel) after masturbating himself.  I myself did not ejaculate.  

He just called me today morning to tell me that he recently learned that he was HIV positive.  How worried should I be about me being infected somehow?  We're both pretty sure the lube never was cross contaminated, nor our gloves but I'm freaking out.  Please help :("

She is a young girl (20) but I am worried that she might have had unprotected sex with a lot of other men.  It didn't phase her at all when I said I didn't have any condoms, she just told me to put it in.  

We don't even talk anymore.  The ""relationship"" was over a week later (this is about 3 weeks ago now). 

Anyway I had heard that you need to wait 6 months before an HIV test will be effective, is that true?

Google seems to have too much static on the subject, especially for guys.  Willing to spend money, I just don't want to shell out unnecessarily.  I don't have a doctor that I see for checkups or anything.  Greater LA area if that matters.

What should I be looking for out of clinics/ doctors?  What should I expect as far as cost, turnaround, actual exams?  Getting a good test would let me know, and potentially keep me from screwing up someone else's life.

A few weeks ago (3), I got smashed and hooked up with a friend.  wasn't planning on it, didn't have condoms, so was going to just wait for another time but she said ""you could just do it anyway"" and I asked if she's 100% tested up and clean and she said yes (long term friend, someone I generally trust to be honest here).  

anyway.  3 weeks later I get this flu-type thing.  I know my HIV stuff from high school and I go into get a quick test (I get a test every 6 months/in between partners anyway), test shows up negative, but the nurse says that I would be in the window period where I might not test positive.  What I'm wondering is, if I got the flu-like symptoms, would I test positive, or might I still show a false negative?

The point is, I think she may have HIV and I had sex with her for a bit with a broken, basically removed, condom.

Essentially, what I'm asking is, what are the odds of having HIV after little exposure?

We were using a condom, but at some point, it was no longer on my dick. I finished and then we went our separate ways. I then remembered that HIV is a huge worry. I did not notice any blood on the condom or my dick at all, and he used a lot of saliva. He did say he was clean multiple times, but that's on his word. 

Since that incident (a couple days ago), I've been constantly reading up about HIV, and it looks as a top who used a condom at least part of the time with no bleeding, I'm at a lower risk than I would have been if I was bottom. However it's still a risk and it's really weighing down my mind. I plan on getting tested in a couple weeks, then at the six week mark, but until then I still feel very anxious.

I'm using my porn account for anonymity. I'm leaving a lot of detail out of my story for privacy reasons, but feel free to ask any questions and I will answer them if I can.

I'm in my early 20's. A few years prior to my birth, my mother was a registered nurse on call at the emergency room when woman who was dying of an AIDS related disease (hystoplasmosis, I believe), was admitted and treated with a high dosage of AZT, one of the few HIV medications available during the late 80's. She was given a lot of pain killers and essentially prepared for death, being treated for AIDS on the off chance that she would live. While the doctor my mother was assisting was giving the woman an injection, my mother accidentally reached for something on the nursing table at the exact same time the doctor went to set the used needle down. She was stabbed in the wrist, and contracted HIV. I was born a couple of years later, and contracted the virus from being breastfed. I was lucky enough to be born into a wealthy family and near a hospital who specializes in pediatric AIDS (among other things). I had a good, albeit difficult, childhood, and due to medical advancements a fairly normal adolescence.

My viral load is currently non-detectable and my last CD4 count was 960 (normal is 500-1500). I am on a fairly new regimen of antiretrovirals with fairly mild side effects (truvada, ritonovir, atazanavir, and raltegravir for those interested). I am in fairly good shape, and I eat well and exercise regularly. I would consider myself healthier than the average American and don't see that changing anytime soon. I should live a long and healthy life.

I'm not Matt Daemon or anything, but I consider myself attractive enough. I have a strict rule that whomever I am with must know I am HIV+ before we do anything past making out/light fooling around. I would be more lenient if wearing condoms while getting blow-jobs were more common, but that tends to lead to... questions. I am still a virgin in the strictest sense (no penetration), but am not new to sexual activity and/or sexuality in general. My lack of sex is mostly attributed to my being too shy/nice, but HIV has definitely cock-blocked me more than once.

[This is a good article about HIV transmission.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/jun/29/condoms-hiv-treatment-prevention) Essentially, my non-detectable status makes the likely hood of transmission very, very low. Having said that, I won't have unprotected sex with someone until a vaccine becomes available, and even then I would be extremely cautious. Hell, I wouldn't even finish inside someone while wearing a condom unless I couldn't help it. Basically, in a hypothetical situation I would wear a condom and finish outside of you, either into the condom or onto a tissue/sock/something that isn't you. You wouldn't come into contact with my semen at all, unless you were just super comfortable with the idea of me finishing on your boobs and politely wiping it up for you.

Also, I apologize for sloppy grammar. It's late and I have an exam tomorrow."

I met a guy, we slept together 4 times without using condoms (I'm on birth control). He pulled out each time and came on my stomach and chest. Later I found out he had slept with a guy about a year ago. He said he had been tested afterwards and was clean, his last test was spring of this year. I met him in September and we slept together until mid-October. He had also been sleeping with other people but said it had all been safe.

While things were ending with this guy, I slept once with the guy who would later become my current boyfriend. We didn't use condoms. I finally realized how absolutely stupid I was being, and we both went to get checked. Both of us were clean for everything else, but I know that HIV takes three months to show up, so I didn't get the test done.

Three months from the last time I slept with the first guy will be mid-January. I just feel so worried about the whole thing, I can't stop looking up transmission rates. What's the likelihood that I actually have HIV? I feel even worse because my boyfriend and I have slept together without condoms more than once, and tried anal once as well. If I do have it and passed it to my boyfriend, I will be utterly destroyed. 

Sorry if any of these details are unclear, you can ask me to specify more about them if you want. Any reassurance you can give me would be great, the waiting is driving me out of my mind.

Should I go for PEP or am i over reacting?

UPDATE: Just had a call from my local STI clinic (I rang and left a message explaining) and they said that based on what i've described the risk is next to nill, and even if for example, one does have intercourse with a HIV positive person AND they ejacualte inside the risk of transmission is only around 1%.

However, after we broke up in October, I took up running (I had been overweight and that was part of why she dumped me) and started running everyday. About a month and a half to two months after I started running, I got a few bumps on my groin and pubic region. They didn't itch or hurt so I just assumed they were ingrown hairs from the running and the sweat. After that, I had no symptoms for two more months. 

Cut to the end of January when I started seeing a new girl. After seeing each other for a month, we got drunk and had unprotected sex. Almost immediately after, I got a rash on the underside of my penis that itched occasionally. While that was going on, I had stopped running (leg injury) but in late February I went for another run and got what I think was an ingrown hair. Bright red bump but no real pain. (Just last weekend it burst and I pulled a dead hair root out of it) Also around this time, the girl I've been seeing started getting headaches on a regular basis. She says she's had sinusitus before and that it's probably that, but I know that headaches are a symptom of HIV.

•           Use clean needles .You must use sterile needle for injection and do not share it with anyone as sharing needles is the 2nd most common cause of HIV transmission between drug addictors.

•           You must use a new condom when you have sex with a partner you do not know whether he/she is HIV positive or not.

•           You must avoid anal sex 

•           If you think you are at high risk ,  you may take Anti-HIV drugs only after your doctor prescribe them for you.

•           If you are HIV positive and you get pregnant , you must get medical care to prevent  passing the virus to your baby, This medical care can prevent your baby from getting HIV infection by nearly 70%.

This came up recently.  One of my sexual partners has had cancer treatment in the past and, as I saw first hand, this has chemically castrated him to the point that he can have an orgasm, sure, but no ejaculate actually comes out.

That said, he is negative, but it spurred the question in my mind about the risk of HIV transmission if the same phenomenon was observed in someone who is HIV+.  Now, for context, I'm a gay man, but this information is useful to anyone who has sex with biological males, which is why I'm asking here instead of /r/lgbtsex.

I'm not ignorant about the ways that HIV can be transmitted: sexual fluids and blood-to-blood contact.  So in a way, this does answer my question.  But I want to hear the hivemind's response, and get this conversation started.

Thanks!

Im a good girl. A straight A student who has one or two friends and doesnt cause trouble. Nobody knows im sexually active. I dont know what im doing in my life.

I have a headache and Ive been feeling weak. I feel sort of nauseous too. What if I have HIV? im so scared. 

I live in the city of Toronto in Canada. if you know anywhere I can get tested anonymously that would be great.

I dont know what to do. Im so nervous"

My problem is this, before I started dating the girl I'm with now I had unprotected anal sex as a bottom with about six different people, only once with all but one of them, and that one maybe five times. She had a pap and some blood work done the other day, the pap came back normal and the JPV test was negative. However, they left her a voicemail about her blood test, saying she needed to call them back. She says they don't do that unless something's up. She can't call them back until tomorrow. She says its possible they didn't take enough blood. The woman took half as much as they usually do because she passes out.

I don't have any evidence to suspect any of my partners had HIV, other than the fact that they are obviously promiscuous, but I am beyond freaking out. If it's something, I hope to god it's something I can fix with a shot. 

What are the odds I've given this poor girl HIV?

Edit - I contacted three different pharmacies and no one I talked to even knew what OraQuick was. When I told them what it was for the shift in their demeanor was noticeable to say the least. Looks like I'm just going to have to wait it out.

Edit - I recieved a text from her just now that said, ""I'm on the phone with the nurse. You did give me something."" I was on the verge of passing out when she finally texted ""hsv1"". So I gave her cold sores, All other tests were clean. I'm in the process of setting up an appointment to get tested now.

I’m a 21yo male, and haven’t had intercourse for 3 years. Prior to that, I had being seeing a girl for a year and, in the throes of youthful insanity, had unprotected sex multiple times.

I should also note that this was not the end of my stupidity - two of these occassions involved unprotected sex while she was on her period, and another incident ended abruptly when a white, gelatinous substance came spilling out of her vagina (which, to this day, I have not really discussed with anyone, and still do not know what it was, so bonus points for anyone who can figure out what that was).

She had told me at the start of our relationship that she had not slept with anyone before, but I recently learned from a very close friend of hers that this apparently was not the case, and that she had in fact slept with several others (and was apparently notorious for doing so).

I have not been able to broach this subject with her, as she is overseas.

Now, I have a certain predisposition to be very anxious about all things regarding my health, so you can imagine the fit of anxiety that has come from me learning about her sexual history, so much so that I have become preoccupied with the possibility of me contracting HIV.

I am visiting a doctor tomorrow for an unrelated issue, but I am thinking of being tested. Do you think that this is a necessary thing to do? I know that the chance of transmission in a developed country from female-to-male is incredibly low, but I can’t help but shake my anxiety about this.

Thanks!"

I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I hope this is. I lost my virginity two weeks ago to this guy I met at a party( I'm a male) and ever since then I haven't really felt well. I think we had protected anal, I wasn't really paying much attention and it was only for like a minute and unprotected oral. Since then, I've had a major sore throat, suffered from some dehydration, headaches, jaw pain, stomach aches, eye twitching, and I have a white tongue. 
Now, these symptoms could be caused by some other things, but I'm not sure. I ran out of contacts probably 2 months ago and have been wearing the same one's since which may explain the eye twitching and the headaches. Since I've replaced them, I've felt slightly better, but I still have minor headaches late at night. Also, I'm a college student home on break so I've been eating really shitty foods lately and I'm a vegetarian .. SO i've been eating high carb foods and chips. I also ran out of multivitamins a while back and haven't taken any, which might explain my exhaustion. I also have impacted wisdom teeth which I should have taken out a while ago, but I'm incredibly lazy so that hasn't happened. My dentist explained that foods and infections can easily get trapped between my teeth, which makes me a bit wary about catching HIV through oral. I've surmised that my jaw pain might be caused by my wisdom teeth. I did meet with my doctor and she claims to have not seen anything in my mouth, but said my symptoms match up with strep throat, so I've been on amoxicilin for the past few days. I'm getting tested in a few days, but I can't help but wonder if all of these separate incidents might be causing my discomfort or made catching something easier.

The encounter involved insertive anal sex (me giving) but the condom seemed to have broken and it was a good few minutes before I realized. 14 hours later (as soon as I possibly could) I went to the clinic absolutely terrified and ashamed...

2014-09-12 I had protected anal sex wherein I was the reciever and unprotected oral sex in which I was the giver. I explicitly asked several times if he has any STDs and he said no and that he was tested recently. Since he took me to his flat, I reckoned he probably wasn't lying since I could just report him to the police and probably ruin his life if he was lying (its illegal and punishable by law to not disclose your STD status to people where I live).


A few days after the encounter, I started having symptoms eerily similar to acute HIV, which is why I am coming here to ask if they match.


Here are the symptoms:

* Sore throat with white/yellowish spots on my tonsils.
* Stuffed nose (only started a few days ago).
* Coughing (also just started recently).
* Fever (for the first few days, dont have fever anymore).
* Feeling ""out of it"", difficulties concentrating sometimes.
* Diarrhea (had it a few days but it stopped now)
* Single flesh-colored bumps localized on my left arm.

Here comes the kicker though:
I was at the doctor because I wanted to check for strep throat. Well, turns out I do not have Strep-A at the very least, which made me 10x more concerned.


The tests that were done measured my temperature (36.5 celsius), if I had Strep-A in my throat (negative) and my kB-CRP count (8mg/L). Do these test results say something?


Anyway, it would be nice to not be ridiculed for a change (its not HIV, stop worrying) but instead have someone come in with factbased arguments and tell me one way or the other if this might be indicative of HIV or not."

There's this girl who is quite pretty and is quite aggressive with me sexually. I haven't had sex in a while, so I would love to take her back to my place. 

That said, I am conflicted. Two of my roommates are medical students, and she had talked to them about HIV antiretrovirals. She recently got out of a relationship that she says ""fucked her up"".

There's no evidence that she has HIV. There's a possibility she's a contact for HIV based on her discussions with them. It would be awkward for me to ask her, unless we're obviously about to have sex.

I know that the risk of transmission from F to M is quite low, especially when engaging in protected sex.

What is the right thing to do here? I would love to have sexual relations with her, but I should be concerned about my long term well being most of all.

Also, I fingered her, and she fingered herself, so her fluids were everywhere. I'm also sure at some point her vaginal fluids did get on my penis from mine or her hands - though I didn't fuck her.

Another thing, I had a slight sore on my penis head after it (chafing from her teeth) though I didn't bleed. 

Don't think her mouth was bleeding also. 

I'm worried that it's asymptomatic or something - I have no idea who she was (it was a hookup thing) or her history or HIV status. Haven't been in contact. A positive diagnosis would literally ruin my life (I would lose my job - don't mean to sound rude).

Am I just being unreasonable or should I get tested? I tend to worry a lot about health matters, but this is really playing on my mind at the moment. Any advice is welcome guys.

Thank you so much.

1) Told my 2 partners about this. They actually took it well. No one freaked out, as the chance of passing was ludicrously small. Told them as soon as I had a chance face to face.

2) We found out the guy was not HIV+. Thank god. Huge fucking misunderstanding.

3) Thank you to those who answered the question as it was asked, and provided good advice. 

4)An especially big thank you to all the people who called me a piece of shit, or that I shouldn't ever have sex again. I asked the question bare bones, with little detail, and you guys filled in the blanks with all sorts of bad stuff, and make me out to be a horrible person. Maybe my friend was coerced. Maybe her and my other partners are trusted friends. Or maybe a philanderer who is barebacking strangers all the time. But thank you for the blind insults. 

It is you who truly make the internet and reddit a wonderful place.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So, a close friend of mine sucked off someone who might be HIV+, but for sake of arguement, lets assume yes. 

&lt;72 hours later, her and I (circumsized male) had unprotected vaginal sex. She told me about the blowjob after the fact.

From my understanding

A) Chances of getting HIV from a single BJ is extremely low

B) Chances of getting HIV from a single act of vaginal sex is pretty low (moreso being circumsized)

C) Even if she did catch it, her viral load would not be great enough within 72 hours to transmit to me

D) It would take months for it to show up on tests, so her and I getting tested is pretty much useless.

Are my facts right? And more importantly, should I be worried about this, go for PREP, and avoid sexual contact with others?"

Trashy, awful, cliche, I know, but it's not like that. We're both in college full time and to save money, we live here. Whatever. Anyways, my bf's mom and younger brother live upstairs.

His brother is easily the grossest person I've ever met. He does not bathe, he does not wash clothes, and his room makes the entire house smell. I'm a clean freak and this drives me up the FUCKING wall. 

Anyways, I'm HIV positive. I know this, my boyfriend knows this, but his mom and his brother don't. Why would they? They have no need to know. 
EXCEPT, little brother likes to come downstairs into our room and steal our shit. All the time. Clothes, my underwear(FUCKING CREEPY), condoms, food (we have our own little kitchen), whatever. 

So, today, while I was home alone, I went to go use my vibrator.
A. I kept my vibrator in my car. My locked car, because I knew little brother likes to come downstairs AND TAKE MY SHIT.

B. I keep it in this little discreet pouch hidden in like a secret drug pocket of one of my seats. Three things always in there: vibrator, 2 condoms, and a toy cleaner wipe thing. 

The pouch was left unzipped, both condoms were missing, and little brother left his very distinct smell behind. Trust me, the smell of an unbathed, axe covered body leaves a very, VERY obvious trail. 

How am I supposed to approach this situation? From the looks (and smell of ASS) on the vibrator, he didn't use the condom on the vibrator and I didn't clean it the last time I used it (gross, I know, but it's not like I WAS EXPECTING SOMEONE ELSE TO USE IT). Do I tell his mom? Because he's a STUPID teenager and the fact that he may have just contracted HIV will go way way way over his head. 

I am so angry, I feel so violated, and I cannot believe he crossed that fucking line.

What do I do? Help.

You hear about people who lie about their HIV status and go around deliberately infecting people. 

I don't hookup much because I'm held back out of fear for catching something. Even for safe sex. I always ask if they're disease free and clean and they ask me too. But sometimes I want to go further and ask them for proof, like a copy of their STD test. That's obviously going too far though, so I just have to trust the person.

Hypothetically, if a sexual partner told you (in an online chat or text for example) that they are 'clean', and it turned out they were lying and were actually HIV+, would that online chat be enough to incriminate them? Or would the word 'clean' be too ambiguous and not be taken seriously by the court? 

I know this sounds like a complicated question but it's really very generic. Having an affirmative answer would help quell my insecurities which are holding me back from having a sex life.

EDIT: Thank you all for sharing your opinions and the facts you uncovered. I apologise for using the word 'clean' as I too think it is inappropriate. I was just so used to seeing that word in this context. It seems there can be no definite answer to my question because these cases are highly situational and don't come about too often (at least in the media), which is surprising considering the high rate of HIV infections, especially in young people.

It's pretty simple: you take an anti-HIV drug when you're HIV-negative, but doing things that might put you at risk, like sleeping with partners of unknown status. It's called Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and it almost completely eliminates the risk of acquiring HIV. 

In combination, the two trials ([PROUD](http://www.croiconference.org/sessions/pragmatic-open-label-randomised-trial-preexposure-prophylaxis-proud-study) and [IPERGAY](http://www.croiconference.org/sessions/demand-prep-oral-tdf-ftc-msm-results-anrs-ipergay-trial)) included 937 high risk individuals who didn't have HIV when the trials started. Half took PrEP and the other half took a placebo or nothing. Both trials got stopped early because PrEP was so effective that it was unethical not to make it available to the non-PrEP groups! 27 people got HIV in the non-PrEP groups, but only 3 in the PrEP groups. And of those three, at least two had stopped taking their pills and didn't have any medicine in their bodies when they got infected. In both trials, PrEP reduced risk by 86%. 

These are just the latest two studies to show that PrEP is great at protecting people from getting HIV. The medication used in these studies, called Truvada, was approved for use as PrEP by the US FDA a couple of years ago. Today, most insurance companies will pay for it and you can get a prescription from your doctor if PrEP makes sense for you. I don't work for the company that makes the drug or an insurance company.

So PrEP with Truvada is an exciting new option to protect yourself from HIV. Of course, it doesn't protect against other STIs, and it's most effective when used with condoms, so safer sex with condoms is still a good idea.

I'm not a medical professional, so don't take my word for it. There are also plenty of details and people for whom PrEP isn't a good idea. To learn more, look at these resources.

My doctor's office has an online portal where you can view your test results and I just checked. All of my other STD tests came back negative within the first few days of being tested, although they were all cultures, not bloodwork.

I cannot remember if it normally takes this long to get HIV tests back or not.

So recently, on 2/28/2015, I tested negative for HIV. I had no real concern or exposure to HIV. I just wanted to get checked. You know, being responsible. 

Prior to that I haven't had sex since 2011 (I know, a long time). That was unprotected and with my X-wife. Since then, I received 4 blow jobs and performed oral on 2 woman - all unprotected. All these incidents occurred greater than 3 months prior to my recent HIV test (the most recent was around 15 weeks from the test). Also, all those ladies shared that they were clean and recently tested.

Here is my concern. Around the the first of this year, 1/7/2015 - 1/8/2015, i fingered (clit stimulation and penetration) two different ladies. They mentioned that they were both recently tested and clean. I don't recall having any significant cuts or finger issues. I even recall that I had something (like a cut) on my right hand and I made it a purpose to use my left hand / fingers. Humorously, as a rightie, it made the fingering session challenging with my left hand. 

So, here are the questions:

1. Am I at risk? Should I be concerned?
2. In my google research, there seems to be a mixed view. Some people say there is ""no risk"" and that not a single person has ever been infected by fingering (fingerer or the fingeree). Then some other sites just give blanket warnings that, ""it is theoretically possible"". What does theoretically possible mean really? They also say that is negligible. In medical terms, what does, ""negligible"" mean? Some forum say it is, ""No risk"" or ""Zero risk"". Which is correct?
3. In the research, I have heard that a wound must be, ""deep, recently fresh and bleeding (like you would have to finger the woman with an actively bleeding finger)"" in order to considered a potential risk and even there there is science that states that contracting HIV in this case would still minimal risk. My question is, why? What is the science behind this? If I had a tiny cut on my penis and had unprotected sex that would put me at greater risk right? Clearly there are many variables. I am just trying to understand the reasoning.
4. Although another weird question, I have heard that people contracting HIV from to a wound is next to impossible because of the way the body works (instant scabbing and clotting). Any support this this?

Once again, Thank you for your constructive responses.

Well, the local clinics do most things for free (HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia) but hepatitis and herpes cost money so he hasn't gotten around to getting those 2 yet. He already tested negative for all the free ones but since then, he confided in me that he was roofied in a bar and felt really bad for a few days but didn't go into much more detail than that. I'm concerned that he may have been raped and possibly contracted something (This may be presumptuous but I figure the sort of human who drugs people in bars is less likely to be 'clean'). I really want to ask him about it but at the same time I'm afraid that it would be emotionally traumatic to ask. How do I inquire gently about this?"

I am just young guy and doesn't have much partners, I voulnteer to help some homeless people in Saturdays. last month, there was a homeless guy who was bleeding and left huge amount of blood in his seat. when I cleaned it, I just used paper towels without any gloves. In the middle of it I found out that my bare hands are in contact with his blood. Now I workout daily and because of the barbell I had some some open wounds in my palm! I don't know how to describe it but my palm has skin cut out of it.
I cleaned myself with soap when I noticed it, I don't know about the homeless guy history at all and I am not saying because he is homeless he must have HIV. Usually most of the guys are drug addict and I am just trying to be safe here:(
I started to get worried when my roommate told me that if I touched his blood I contracted it and I need to get tested. I am 19 year college student and it is impossible for me to get tested :(.

He put the tip in, used a bit of lube, moved it about a bit gently, then stopped. 5 minutes all told. We masturbated some more and that was it. No oral, no kissing, and I didn't encounter any of his fluids. We played it safe.

But I did notice a spot of blood on the toilet paper after a bowel movement later that night, likely from the penetration. If there was even a slight amount his fluid on the condom, it's possible to catch something.

He was a man in good health and he told me that he was free of all diseases, and I believe him. He said he had met men online before, but I failed to ask how recently.

My question is, should I look into taking medication right away before the 72 hour window closes? This encounter happened about 30 hours ago. I'm really having a difficult time with this."

Well fate has it we have been reunited by studying in the same country. I visited her once and things got REALLY heated (in a good way) and I just went in for the kiss and it was the best I've ever had.

The elephant in the room however, is that given her backround and the fact that I know she was promiscuous last time I saw her several years ago leads me to hesitate. I honestly just stopped visiting her out of fear of HIV and not being able to confront her about whether she has it or not, or other serious STDs.

So, really, how do I go about this? There's a decent language barrier between us, and although I can certainly communicate the question and facts, I am very blunt in general and I'm afraid she'll take it the wrong way. We can only communicate through text or through face to face contact, but she lives 5 hours away.

TL;DR   Paid for a massage in Singapore, got more than just a massage.  Used protection, still worried about HIV.
  

I was recently on a business trip and wound up at a massage place in Singapore.  

Seemed kind of seedy but didn't think too much of it.  Went in, had a nice massage but then got more than I had bargained for.  Ended up having protected sex with the masseuse.
  
She was very careful to take the condom off -- looking at it, it did not seem to have broken (the reservoir was in tact) and didn't appear to tear or leak.  When I asked her if she was clean, she said yes and that she has been tested, but I don't know if she was just saying that or if she was telling the truth.
  
I'm freaking out about having HIV though!!  
Everything I have read says you can't get HIV through a latex condom but it doesn't seem to be putting my mind at ease.  
I have also read that it's a lot less common for men to get HIV from a woman, but that doesn't seem to help either.
   

Since it has been roughly 7 days, I went in for some STD testing but knowing that the regular tests won't pick up HIV, I scheduled an HIV RNA test (damn expensive too), which supposedly will pick it up at 9 to 11 days.

Am I just over reacting?  Short of destroying my marriage ~ guilt ridden, I told my wife, this has been the worst mistake of my life.

While in Japan, I went to a Pink Salon this one time. For those not familiar with the term - a Pink Salon is a blowjob bar. You pay a preset amount of cash and you get a blow job. Usually bare back unless you ask otherwise.

So long story short, I got a BJ In one of these pink salons. Now to make things clear - I do not have any good reason to believe I caught anything. This wasn't a shifty underground place and the girl, although not beautiful, did not look like a crack whore. From a little bit of research on the internet, I think it is safe to assume that I will be completely fine.

The reason for my paranoia is somewhat a moral issue - I have learnt that HIV Can be detected only after 3 to 6 months (!). I am about to fly home, after a 3 month trip around Asia and my girlfriend will be waiting for me. I will not be able to live with myself if I somehow get her infected.

Few questions to you guys - If no signs are shown. Is it safe to assume I'm clean? Can a test be made and get accurate results prior to 3 months? Can I do the test in a foreign country and somehow get results by email?
Are any signs supposed to show prior to 3 months?

I believe I might be completely over reacting. I regret this stupid decision very much.

I matched with a guy on tinder, he seemed sweet, and he wanted to meet up in person. We actually do go meet up, walk through some museums, and we had a pretty good time together. We ate lunch together, and I complained how my back hurts from running. We later agreed to go to his place because he took a class in massages. Later in his place, he told me to take off my pants for the massage and before I did so, I asked him repeatedly does he have any STD's or any sexually transmissible hazards I should be aware about. Again, I asked him this MULTIPLE times. Again and again, he denied having such. Things got pretty tense and he ended up blowing me. He also got a little bit of some cum and precum on his hand and he later fingered me without washing his hand. I also later gave him a hand job. This intercourses were all without condoms. So as I left, I asked him AGAIN if he had any STD/STI's and again, he again said no. Fast forward two days later, I texted him once more asking about if he has HIV. After a long discussion, he admits he had HIV and I flipped the fuck out. I was upset for many reasons. (1) I was upset he lied to me; he could have just told the truth and we still could have gotten along just fine, just taken a little more precautions. (2) It made me furious how he so recklessly was jeopardizing someone else's health just because he was ""in the moment."" He even told me I seemed so frightened about HIV that he figured it was not the right time to discuss it with you. I wish he told me that before the intercourse. He played some mind tricks on me saying how ""it hurts that how he wasn't trusted."" I'm not falling into that bullshit. I guess what I'm wondering is what are the chances I contracted HIV and when should I get tested? I can't get PeP because it's too expensive and I heard it has horrible side effects. Plus, all clinics are closed by now and tomorrow is Sunday (all clinics are pretty much closed) which will make it 72 hours. He told me he was undetectable so even if we did stuff like bareback the chances of me getting it is like .01%. I'm super furious right now and I have no idea what to do. Please help.

TL;DR: Guy said he had no STD/STI or anything of that nature. I trusted him; he gave me a blowjob and fingered me with fingers that had his cum and precum on it. I also gave him a handjob. He later tells me he is positive but undetectable as if that is a way to somewhat justify him lying about his status.

EDIT: I don't know if this helps or not, but sometimes when I wipe my but with toilet paper, blood sometimes gets on it. I think this indicates a cut or open wound inside my anus. Will this increase my chances of contracting HIV?"

I feel like I'm learning more and more awful secrets about him everyday. This partner told me ""I got the vaccinations for genital herpes since I found out I was positive. It is one shot every 3 months and I finished my last at my January 2015 check up."" He also later told me that he tested negative for the herpes (May 2015) and though he is immune to herpes he is still not herpes free. He also said at this point transmission was impossible. Can I trust him? Again, this is male to male contact, and no condoms. We did fingering with cum on his fingers, he blew me, and we did some penis to penis frotting. He also did peck me on the lips. I also did not take PeP as it was too costly."

I am a male 28 years old and on friday i had sex with a girl i met that night. I put a condom and she gave me oral sex and then we had vaginal intercourse until i finished. Mid intercourse my condom got into the half of the penis (the condom covered half of it), but i ajusted it back into the original possition. I noticed that the part of my penis that was discovered for a bit was wet, probably from vaginal fluids. Now i have a question, when the sexual relationship ended, and i took my condom away, Is it possible that her vaginal fluids that were on the base of my penis could have ""roll"" to the head of my penis? I mean, when i rolled out the condom, is it possible that those vaginal fluids could have reached the top of my penis?

Thanks a lot, ill hope you guys could tell me something usefull. Sorry for my bad English.

If you both tested negative, what would be the likelihood of transmission of virus and seroconversion due to either false negatives or levels of virus that were undetectable, but still transmittable.

Of course the obvious thing to say is that even negative tests wouldn't protect you from other STDs. However as a thought experiment, would this be considered a safe way to prevent HIV transmission from unprotected sex.

Lastly for the lay people out there, could you see STD testing in real time immediately before sex a preferable option to the use of other prophylactics. Do you think this is the future of safe sex?"

I’ve just been feeling incredibly nervous all morning and thought I could turn to Reddit for help or comfort.

So, I’ve been with my fiance for almost 3 years. He’s the first and only person I’ve ever been with. I recently posted in here about me getting diagnosed with Chlamydia last week, even though I’ve never cheated and he swears he never has. Last year when I had my annual pap spear at the gyno I came up negative for Chlamydia, which is why I thought he must have cheated. But after a lot of conversations and tears, I truly do not believe he would ever cheat on me and either that test last year was wrong or this was a false positive. I think the chances of that are higher than him cheating, that's how much I trust him.

Before going on I just want to preface this by saying he IS going to get a comprehensive STD test tomorrow for everything, so I’m mainly turning to Reddit now for temporary comfort until he gets his results back.

This morning I just started freaking out and getting nervous about the possibility of me having something else like HIV. Like I said, he’s the only person i’ve been with, but I didn’t make him get tested before we started having sex. Probably dumb and naive, but I didn’t. Neither of us have ever had symptoms but I know that doesn’t mean you’re in the clear. He swears he always used condoms with one-night stands and the girlfriend he had before me told him last week that she was clean when he asked her about chlamydia. He said he was with 2 maybe 3 people after her, but used condoms every time. He also said he donated blood around that time too and everything was fine.

I know the chances are low, but I’m kind of ignorant when it comes to HIV, its demographics and the probability of contracting it. I know Reddit can't diagnose me, but hopefully someone here can put my mind at ease until we get his results back for everything? I haven’t been able to concentrate at work AT ALL today. :("

Two months went by after I last met up with someone and one day I suddenly realized how stupid I had been and had a panic attack.  I realized that I had put myself in so much risk and that I could have contracted an STD. I set up an appointment at my local planned parenthood and got tested.  All tests came back negative and it gave me a big relief. But since it hadn't been more than three months since my last encounter I've been really paranoid lately,  specially Because my throat has been sore for more than three weeks and my neck feels swollen.  I know those symptom are too vague but I can't help but be paranoid that I might have the virus and haven't shown the usual symptoms like some people do. I've been reading online and some people don't show any symptoms at all. I'm scared that I might be one of those people.  It's been two months and a half since I last met up with someone,  I have another appointment for the 12th of December to get tested again. 
I'm just really scared and I don't even know what to ask,  I guess I just want reassurance that I most probably did not contract HIV. I mean,  I haven't developed a high fever,  rashes,  fatigue or other symptoms that people usually develop about two weeks after contraction of the virus. But I'm just scared that I might be in that percentage of people that don't develop any symptoms at all. "

The story is kind of tragic, as she grew up in an orphanage and had to have a blood transfusion. She was from a not so well developed country and apparently they did not use needles in the proper safe way. Now this was quite shocking to hear, but she told me she is part of the 1% of HIV victims that do not have to take any medication due to some rare gene mutation, so her blood tests have shown an undetectable viral load for nearly 20 years now (she's in her late 20s) 

She was very open about the whole thing and encouraged me to ask any questions i might have. Her doctor even says she would be perfectly capable of having kids without any risk of tranmission. My chances of catching anything is virtually zero as long as we use protection.

I was very uncomfortable with all this and she has offered to give me her doctors phone # and she'll answer any questions or concerns i might have. 

I've done some research myself and it looks like the chances of transmission from ""elite controllers"" is very slim however i am just not sure if its worth having sexual relations with this girl. We do like each other very much so i really dont know how to proceed"

I'm a bit embarrassed to admit this as I'm a virgin - but after fail after fail after fail I finally had a little bit of intimacy (and now I'm worried)

To start, I've never even kissed a girl... and last night I sucked on a breast and I'm worried.

I've just been so sick of all my friends having luck with women and me not.

From what I can see its no problem at all, but I don't know, I tend to get paranoid (Maybe that is what stopping me actually finding a woman on my own)

I'm currently in Indonesia (Bali) with my family. I've been going to the dance clubs here and had no luck even talking to anyone. Not even the local girls want anything to do with me

So on my way home last night I stopped in at a massage parlour and worked up the courage (I was a little drunk) to get something ""extra""

Anyway I had success and at the end of the massage the woman agreed to ""massage"" me downstairs in which I came.

Basically after an hour massage she rubbed oil on my penis and I ejaculated after about 30 seconds.

She also removed her bra and let me suck on one of her breasts for a little bit.

I'm pretty embarrassed here to type this -  and even though I had her breast in my mouth for no longer than 10 seconds, there was no fluid or any discharge or anything that didn't look like a normal, dry, nipple... but now I'm wondering if I can get HIV from this.

I don't have any cuts or anything from I can see on my lips either.

She seemed healthy, which I know means nothing and other than her touching me downstairs quickly with oil and my loosely sucking her nipple, that was it.

But of course-  paranoid me is worried.

My family would be so embarrassed and un supportive. I think they'd probably kick me out of the house. Especially my older brother who never stops giving me a hard time and my step dad who i've never really ever spoken to in detail whom I know doesn't really like me much

Anybody shed some light it would be great if I should be worried.

 From what I can see most documentation says its not a big deal but i'm just worried because I'm overseas and in Bali (indonesia country).


I guess more importantly... why can't I just be normal and find a girlfriend :(

I'll never find one if I get HIV or Aids

Do antibodies fluctuate as time goes by?

As the title says, I(22F) need some advice about hiv and blowjobs. Last friday, I was over at a friends house(27M) and we got stoned (I live in the Netherlands so it's legal) and things escalated a bit and I ended up giving him a blowjob. I swallowed. 

Later when we were laying down and still stoned, he told me that he has hiv. I couldn't believe what I heard and was shocked so I didn't say anything about it. I ended up staying the night and gave him a morning bj and swallowed AGAIN..I know, very stupid of me. But in all honesty, I didn't know exactly what hiv was and didn't know how he could pass it on to me.


Anyway, I'm sorry for talking too much. But I don't know what to do and I've been thinking about this for the past few days and I'm freaking the fuck out. It doesn't help that I'm muslim and my parents are too...so I can't tell them anything about all of this because they don't even know I'm doing stuff like this.


I'll see my friend again tomorrow and I'm obviously gonna talk about this but in the meantime, I hope you guys can help me out in what I should be doing next. Do I go to the doctor? Get tested? What are the symptoms even of hiv and how likely is it for me to have gotten it?

I'm aware of how badly I fucked up and would love any kind of help the community can provide.

I'm a (21M) who recently had drunken, unprotected, vaginal relations with a girl 23F. As far as I know, she's unaware of any diseases she might have and for the most part isn't prone to sleeping around and had one consistent, stable (and STD unknown) partner weeks before.  Our escapade lasted an embarrassing minute or so when I finally sobered and realized what a horrible idea this was.

Now about three to four weeks later I'm beginning to feel symptoms of early stage HIV - rash, fever, swollen thyroid, fatigue and I'm starting to freak out. I'm currently abroad where tests aren't widely available so in the meantime I only have time to contemplate how big of a fuck up I am until I return home. If this girl did have an HIV despite not knowing it, the timing would be so that she would be most contagious during our time together.

If anyone has experience with this, I'd love a second opinion. Of course I'm going to get checked but what are the realistic odds that I've actually contracted it versus making things up in my head."

I began having unprotected oral sex with my partner about a month ago, and that's the only sexual contact I've ever had. I don't use drugs. I've never had a blood transfusion. 



Yesterday, I went to Planned Parenthood to get a pelvic exam, STD check, and birth control. I wanted to get everything checked out before I started having actual intercourse. When they offered me an rapid HIV test for free, the possibility that I had HIV seemed so remote that I just said yes so I could get some extra good news in my results.


They swabbed me, took the OraQuick out of the room, and then gave me the regular exam. About an hour and a half later when the exam was over, my clinician left the room and came back to give me my results. She said that I had tested positive for HIV. I was shocked and confused. She said false positives are possible but rare, and she had never actually seen a false positive case before. However, she said that she would have considered me very low risk and was surprised at the result herself.


They drew blood so they could confirm the preliminary positive of the oral swab, and they scheduled a follow up to give me my results a week later. 


I spent the next 8-9 hours freaking out, panicking, crying, etc. I took the day off work and couldn't think about anything else. My partner stayed calm. He and I made it into a free clinic just before they closed to get tested. When I asked if I could get tested again that day, they basically said it wasn't worth it for me but that my partner should get the test done. His results were negative. I felt so much better knowing that. I knew that he was alright, but I was even more confused. Oral with him was the only time I thought I might have risked exposure, but after his negative result I didn't have ANY idea of where I might have been exposed to HIV. 


On the drive back (after the clinic had closed), I started regretting not getting the test done a second time. We stopped at a pharmacy and found a home HIV test. It was OraQuick, the same kind we had both used earlier that day. We took it home and followed the directions. This time, my results were negative. 


So today I went back to the clinic as soon as I could to get another test. I thought the home one might have been a fluke, or I could have done it wrong. The clinic gave me the OraQuick and had my results 20 minutes later. Another negative.


I am so confused. The two negatives were reassuring, but where did that preliminary positive come from? What are the odds that I actually have HIV? The clinic worker I spoke to said he hadn't seen a case like mine before. I still have a week to wait for my blood test results. I'm much calmer now than I was yesterday, but I'm still dying to know what's going on. Any ideas would be appreciated.



TLDR: In the last 40 hours I have taken the same version of the rapid HIV test three times. The first result was positive, but the second two were negative. Prior to that first test, I had no reason to believe I had been exposed to HIV. Not knowing what's going on with me is driving me crazy. "

3) she had cancer


4) I'm im Dallas, where 2013 stats indicate ~940 women had HIV (http://aidsvu.org/state/texas/dallas/) so the chances she had it (extrapolating for new cases) would be about .5% considering the Dallas female population.


5) 72 hours have not passed, and PeP is still an option but I'm not entirely sure if this is high risk exposure


6) she said she was clean after we had sex but as we all know that doesn't mean anything

7) I tried contacting her, but no response granted it may not have been to most direct way to get a hold of her 


Obviously I am going to get tested once the appropriate time window passes, but am I overly worried with thinking i should do PeP? Furthermore am I freaking out more than I should considering all the HIV stats along with the chances of this random female in Dallas having it?

I recently turned 20 years old, I am a heterosexual male, circumcised. I for some reason decided to hire an escort on two separate occasions. I was a virgin before these encounters.

The first was on the 1st of August, we used a condom for vaginal intercourse, however without me noticing she had began performing oral on me without a condom for around 20 or less seconds before I asked her to put a condom on. We then proceeded to have vaginal sex. The condom was secure as far as I can tell, after I had finished there was some sperm on the inside of the condom on the shaft of my penis, as this was my first time, I don't know if this is normal. I showered and urinated shortly after. The cost was 105 dollars for 30 minutes.

The second time was on Saturday, the 6th of August. I met with an escort. She put a condom on which was slightly too long, however fit the width of the penis. She performed oral sex and then we had sex for literally a minute or two. I finished inside her, with the condom on. She took off the condom, there was no leakage or dripping, and as far as I can tell, the condom did not break. She charged 78 dollars for 30 minutes.

I am truly regretting what I did, I am in a committed long-distance relationship. I feel like utter shit, I live in the UK and I seen these girls ad online on a website on which they need to pay. I've spoken with both girls, they've confirmed they're clean and both got kind of angry that I was even asking, one said that I care about my life as much as you do about yours and the other said she always uses condoms, and gets tested monthly, even went as far as to send me a picture of her latest medical test (30th of June).

I am afraid that I may have contracted HIV.

I don't know what it is, is it anxiety? stress? I can't sleep, I haven't ate in a day, I just don't feel hungry. I feel so disconnected from everything, I might even be suicidal.

I just really need help, someone, please help me. What should I do? I am disconnected from everything around me just thinking what would happen if I did have HIV, I am an only child, my parents would be devastated if anything was to happen, my girlfriend would also be. I feel like a piece of shit and there's a heavy weight on my heart that just isn't moving. I can't sleep, I can't eat.. I just need help, someone, please."

My girlfriend and I have been dating 4 years, and we are both 28. We were not each other's first sexual partners, though she slept around significantly more than I did before we got together. We've recently been trying to find another woman for a threesome, and when we were discussing boundaries, she told me she didn't want our third to get an STD test before we had sex with them.

We argued about this for a while, and here's what I've gathered. She has some sort of great love for catching STDs. When she was sleeping around when she was younger, she would require her partner not to use condoms so that she could catch anything that they had. She would also go as long as possible without treatment. Her goal is to catch herpes and HIV (she says treatable conditions aren't as appealing to her?). She'll also only be happy if she catches them from me, so she wanted to find partners that could infect me so that I could infect her.

Needless to say, I'm baffled. I'm also really concerned for her mental health. She tells me that she's fine and that this isn't that weird, but I can't help but thinking that there's something desperately wrong with her. I also really don't want to catch herpes or HIV. I have absolutely no idea what to do or how to react to this. We haven't had any sexual contact since, and she's been really mopey and sad since then. She's telling me that I'm judging her for a fantasy, and I'm not going to lie - I absolutely am. 

Does anyone have any thoughts? Should I have her see a mental health professional? Should I bail? I'm really honestly quite freaked out, but I don't want to throw away what we've spent so long building.

Edit: I finally managed to convince her to go see a professional, thanks to all of your help. We will not be having sex until this is all figured out. I'm really not sure I want to be in a relationship with her anymore, and I don't really understand why. I'm going to take the time to try and figure that out while she gets help. Whether or not our relationship survives this, I hope I can at least get her the help she needs so that this doesn't end up affecting her life too much. Thanks again everyone. "

I know this might seem like a naive question, but I'm fairly sexually inexperienced. I'm going in for testing next week, but my anxiety is very high right now.

I met up with a stranger from Craiglist (me a dude, she a she). She didn't say anything in her post about being disease free, but she was pretty fast and loose as it was. Let's assume she had something (she wasn't dirty and didn't strike me as a street-drug user when we met, but of course: who knows).

We had sex and used two condoms (neither broke, I just came in one). She said she was just coming off of her period, and there was a small amount of blood afterward on my pelvis. I took my condom off and my wang was clean, then I cleaned the blood off of me and took a shower.

I know no one can say with certainty, but from an anecdotal perspective, am I at a high risk of contracting something, here? Should I be worried? How effective are condoms (it was put on properly and we had no problems with breakage or them coming off)?

This was just a few days ago, but FWIW I've seen no symptoms of anything.

Thanks, folks.

I've been bicurious for a while and I finally decided to go for it and try it.

I met him on a subreddit meant for that kind of thing and we talked a bunch before we met up. He said he was disease free (tested 2 years ago and has only had sex a few times since then, always with a condom) and he invited me into his home, so I do trust that he fully believed he was disease free.

So, we ended up hooking up. I blew him, he blew me (both unprotected), then I tried bottoming (protected) and it didn't work so I ended up finishing him unprotected. He came a bit I my mouth at the end.

So, 2 days later I went to the doctor and got some STI tests done. A week later I received the results back and all of them came back negative except for the HIV test, which was inconclusive.  My doctor told me that since what I did was low risk, she thinks it was probably a lab mess up because in my results she said that everything they look for HIV with came back negative except one thing, which was inconclusive. I'm not sure about detail, that's just how she described it.  I was pretty freaked out.

I started reading online and I found out that apparently a lot of inconclusive tests are usually because there's a minor infection but not enough to fully confirm it. I also noticed a very light red rash on my upper chest that appeared the next day, which I've read is a symptom of HIV.  

I'm just really freaking out about this, and I'd love some advice or ideas of what I'm supposed to do and if anyone knows, the likelihood for my test to come back negative in the end.  I'm supposed to wait until September 30th to get another test done to confirm it, and I was actually supposed to meet up with someone for a date next week but my doctor advised against sexual contact until I get a fully confirmed negative test. (How do I cancel a date for a reason like this without scaring the person off?)

Sorry for the wall of text. Please read it all, but:

TL;DR I got an inconclusive HIV test and I don't know what do to or think. Does anyone have expertise in this area and would like to shine some light on my situation?"

On our last meet up we decided that I would blow him. He put the condom on, realized it was not rolling down, so flipped it over. I gave him a blow job for a few minutes, but the condom wasn't feeling good. He took it off and finished himself into a paper towel. 

10 days later I developed a pretty bad cold (fever, runny nose, cough), which lasted for about 2 weeks.

What are the chances of HIV being transmitted this way? I'm imagining a small amount of precum could have been on the condom when he flipped it over. 

I got an HIV test 2 months later, which was negative. But I know I should have waited 3. I am now pretty worried, and would really like to hear someone's thoughts on the matter."

I am having another freak out, and I could really use some insight and support.

In the middle of July I met up with a guy on a gay hookup app. We met at his place and masturbated next to each other. We were closely next to each other, but we otherwise kept our hands to ourselves. I finished first, then stood up while he finished. We got dressed and I left.

Later that day I noticed that I actually had a small herpes cold sore near the base of my penis.

5 and a half weeks later I came down with a fever that was between 99 and 101, which lasted for about 3 days. During the second day I also began to get watery diarrhea after every time I ate. This lasted for about 3 weeks. Throughout this time I also experienced general fatigue and some minor aches and pains. 

Now, 2 months after the initial encounter and 6 weeks after starting to feel sick, I have two canker sores on my gums, and I am struggling to eat due to the pain in my mouth. 

I am so confused. I don't know what is causing my symptoms. My doctor tested me for bacterial infections and parasites, and everything came back negative. Eventually he put me on an antibiotic, which did help the diarrhea go away (although I still haven't had a normal bowel movement in about 2 months). 

I wasn't too concerned until I started to research HIV. I believe my encounter was low risk - but could something have been transmitted through the herpes sore? Additionally, do symptoms of seroconversion work this way? Do you keep getting new symptoms as the weeks go on? Has anyone ever heard of transmission occurring like this?"

So some background. I had been chatting with a guy I met on Grindr for a couple weeks and we were getting a long well. He new I was a virgin and super concerned about stds, but was patient and reiterated he was clean numerous times and we would use a condom if we had sex.

Flash forward and I finally got up the confidence to meet him and we ended up having sex. He did use a condom for anal, but we didn't during oral and I was okay with that because, if I understand correctly, the risk of stds is a lot lower during oral sex. I didn't want to risk the condom breaking during anal so I insisted he cum on me (he gave me a facial and then promptly wiped it up with a towel). I did suck him off briefly after he came.

After this encounter my rational self told me I had been safe. Using a condom during anal and he didn't even cum inside me. But just to be safe I got tested for stds including HIV about 2.5 weeks after. Everything came back negative. But for some reason I am just parinoid that I contracted an std, and my worst nightmare would be HIV. My research has told me that antibody tests for HIV can't successfully test the presence of the virus until 3 weeks plus (and you can't feel completely sure until you're tested 3 months out) I have been so stressed I've lost sleep and I also have had a sore throat on and off which I'm worried could be a sign that I did contract HIV (or also just because I've been so stressed).

Due to how much stress this one sexual experience gave me I have decided I'm not going to have another until I get on PrEP. I have an appointment this coming week with a doctor to discuss that. I also am going to insist on being tested again for HIV now that it has over 1.5 months since the encounter.
So I guess my main question is am I being overly parinoid or is there a legitimate concern that I could have contracted HIV?

Thanks."

Recently it's in the form of HIV fear.

Here are the facts:I recently started a monogamous relationship with a heterosexual woman. We've been having unprotected sex and would like to keep doing so. She said I'm her newest partner since testing negative for STDs but she was seeing someone up until a couple months ago. I tested negative 6 months ago, and have since then had protected sex with another woman who also said they tested negative.

To be blunt: I trust my partner, but I am afraid of contracting HIV, and also afraid of her leaving me if I make a big stink about it. I keep looking up stats to try and ease my mind. I read that 4 out of 100,000 white heterosexual women have HIV, and that the odds of transmission are super low (this relates to the casual partner she was seeing when she got tested). These stats don't seem to alleviate my anxiety and I'm not sure how best to proceed here. I don't want to worry about this so much but I don't know how to stop!

Can someone offer some advice on getting through this?

I've always considered myself straight. As I've gone through my twenties I've started to develop a sort of infatuation with penis. At first I thought I might be at least bi. My problem is that the idea of a penis turns me on, but in practice when I try to find porn or pictures I'm immediately turned off. Something about seeing two dudes together just didn't do it for me. Every once in a while I go on craigslist and see if I can find a guy there that I might be sort of attracted to.  Hadn't been able to find a single one. I tried meeting with one guy but as soon as I saw him I lost any arousal I had psyched myself up to.
Fast forward to tonight. I indulge in some drinking and I saw f it I'm finding someone and I'm going to get some experience with a penis. I'm not gonna mess around go meetup, take out this mystery mans dick and see how it feels.
Craigslist ad goes out. Within a few hours I get a couple of responses, only one of which is ready tonight. He sends some blurry as picture and his stats, and he's even got a place to do it at. 
A 3 unit condo and I'm at unit #2. The door opens and I'm greeted by a skinny older gentleman and a plume of marijuana smoke. We don't waste much time before getting into it.
Eventually he's getting me lubed up and I've got a condom on him and his trying to get in my, err, butt. (did I mention I had some anal curiosity as well) Well even with the lube the condom was just tugging on my insides, making it really uncomfortable, but he's being supportive and easy about it. He had told me earlier that he is definitely clean, so in my stupid a** intoxicated mindset I ask him again, ""so you're seriously clean right?"" At which point he reassures me. I ask him if we can take off the condom. He's hesitant about it. But as you can already infer, I'm sure, we started slamming it raw dog. 
He did come inside me, unfortunately at my bequest. 
So here we are, paranoid shitless that I have HIV. So is there still an opportunity to take that ""prep"" stuff? And can I go to a walk in clinic, rather than to my PCP, so I don't have to do the walk of shame to his office?
What steps do I take from here to protect myself. You know outside of dying of shame.

I wrote a lot of the situation out because I thought maybe someone on r/sex is in a similar boat as me as far as questioning your sexuality. If you guys want to know more about it let me know, otherwise I really appreciate your input.

tl;dr had unprotected anal sex (receiving) with a stranger. They said they are clean(like that matters, I know) Where do I need to go from here to protect myself? "

I thought it would all be fine but I received a text message (today) telling me to contact them regarding the results and it turns out the HIV test had a very mild reaction. I now have to go for a further test as a precaution.

I can't find a straight answer online as to whether you can even contract HIV from receiving oral sex as a male as its very contradictory but I was always under the possibly stupid assumption that you couldn't.

Update: went to the hospital today and gave another blood sample, they did a test there and then where they mixed different fluid with my blood and it came up negative which is great. Rest of the blood was sent to the lab and I will get results for that test tomorrow.

I'm still quite new to sex I just lost my virginity earlier this year. In the beginning of this month I gave me casual partner a blowjob and swallowed his semen. It was super hot, super successful and all that jazz. woohoo.  immediately after he left the room I took a huge swing of water from my water bottle. 

Anyways the next morning i had to get some cavities done. I read online that the likelyhood of getting hiv or std is relatively low via oral sex provided that you dont have cuts or sores in your mouth at the time. (which at the time I don't think i had any) but nonetheless it's not a 100 percent guaranteed. 

Anyways this information made me really paranoid and anxious so i contacted him and asked him when the last time he had been tested. he told me early november. I gave him head the second week of december. He had told me his results came back negative and he had not had sex at all during the month of november to when we were intimate. That alleviated my stress.i do trust this partner because a few months ago we had unprotected sex and i went through this whole hiv scare thing and he told me his results came back negative and so did mine. 

 I think im just feeling worried because my lymph nodes are swollen and going on google for answers did really help ( but they are probably swollen because my dad has a really bad cold atm so im probably just catching his cold)

reassurance would be greatly appreciated to calm my anxiety. :-)"

5m4f9g,[condoms] [safe sex] [herpes] Why do condoms protect so much better against HIV/AIDS than herpes if they're both viruses?,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/5m4f9g/condoms_safe_sex_herpes_why_do_condoms_protect_so/,D0ngl3,3,2017-01-04 20:58:19,4,/r/sex/comments/5m4f9g/condoms_safe_sex_herpes_why_do_condoms_protect_so/,NaN,"Before we start throwing out different data sets at each other, what I'm most concerned with is mode of action or method of transmission.

Condoms are 98% effective against HIV/AIDS but far less so for herpes, which has viral shedding, which HIV/AIDS does not. So the idea is that unless blood/semen/vaginal fluid comes in contact with an open cut the shaft/balls, you're protected by skin. The head is a point of entry, though, because it's a mucous membrane.

So my guess is that our sex-ed teachers were afraid to get too graphic on us. I think the real reason a man can get herpes even when using a condom more so than a woman is because he pulls off the condom with his fingers, which get slick with vaginal wetness, and then at some point he inevitably touches the head of his penis with those ""contaminated"" fingers. It's the transfer of vaginal fluid that isn't discussed in detail when we're taught sex-ed in America.

If a man were to touch herpes sores while unrolling the condom, then use those same fingers on the outer surface of the condom while guiding his penis in her vagina, that would be the mode of action for transmitting herpes to the woman. 

To reiterate the question: when condoms fail, assuming they don't break and are applied correctly, why do people still get STI's while practicing safe sex?"

Let's say - I had 3 partners during last 3 months, with two of them I had only oral sex (without protection) and with the other one - oral sex (without protection) and vaginal sex (with protection). In all cases, these are people I know for some time already, so I've felt more safe and trusting. But recently I started to wonder. Well, did we talk about our HIV status? No, we didn't.  I guess we all silently assumed, that we are negative, we have protection in case of vaginal sex and oral has low chance of transmission. (https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/estimates/riskbehaviors.html)

But my mind recently become full of doubt, well, low is low, not zero. But I've never really gave it a thought. I'm going to get tested. I have to say, I'm nervous about the result. I still wonder how is it possible, that all four of us ignored this issue and assumed ""well it's just oral"". Thinking further, from now on, will I always bring this subject to my potential sexual partners before we start anything? Am I safe or paranoid? How do you deal with that issue?

My GF and I are negative. My GF and I had a threesome with a random girl (lets call her R) from a bar - first time ever. Everything I did with R was covered. R only did kissing (mouth) and touching with my GF. What I am worried about is that after having protected vaginal sex with R, I took off the condom, wiped my penis with a t shirt, and proceeded with unprotected sex with my GF. After the night went by, I remembered and started to worry that when I took off the condom after my time with R, her vaginal discharge was at the base of my penis and condom. I only wiped off the discharge with a shirt and proceeded unprotected with my GF.

So, are we at risk? Or am I overthinking it? Responses I got from an HIV forum board said I am over thinking it and that HIV is fragile; IF R had it, the virus would have been rendered untransmittable because of exposure to air since it is very fragile."

I'm not sure if she's HIV negative, but we didn't do anything super risky (no tribbing, we didn't even do oral, etc.) 

She fingered me, then used a strap on for penetrative sex with me (without a condom, but I know STIs really can't survive on sex toys/out of the body for long at all). She told me the strap on is clean, and we had penetrative sex for a while in different positions using it (doggy/me riding her). 

I know the possibility of getting STIs/HIV simply from a strap on she hadn't used in a while is virtually none. But I'm paranoid that any of her fluids got onto the penetrative end of the strap on and came into contact with mine during penetrative sex or just during the whole thing, even though our genitals never directly touched. Or that if she or any of her previous partners has an STI, there is any possibility of the strap on passing it onto me because it was used before. 

Long story but I can't get tested until September, but I'm not sure if it's even necessary. I'm not too sexually active and it was only really with her. Am I at any risk of any STIs or HIV just from this encounter? It seems to be a super low risk situation but just want to clear things up. "

Without baring too many unnecessary details I would like to disclose the fact that I made a risky decision in partaking in sexual intercourse with another male, not too long ago.

I had known this guy for a week, through a friend. He is in his 30s, and completely homosexual. We really managed to hit it off when hanging out at my mate's place. Fast forward to a couple days later, we had both exchanged numbers and been talking about hooking up. 

He comes over, and we agreed it was the custom to use condoms, even though he asked if I prefer them or not. He was referring to himself using them, because he knew I wasn't a top, or going to be topping. We had already let eachother know we were clean at this point. No proof. Just word of mouth.

So, we begin having sex and everything is great. Really respectable like I thought, and I generally just felt really comfortable. He then proposes the idea of messing around in the shower for a bit, to which I agree. This is where I feel like I might have made a life changing decision. The previous condom had been taken off before entering the shower, so a new one was not present. 10 minutes of foreplay pass by, and with my back facing him he decides to ask if I'm cool with him inserting himself into me, bare. I agree. I had washed the head of his penis with the running water and immediately guided him in, to which he inserted, and came out immediately. I am very regretful of this. I had always told myself to never let my guard down no matter the circumstance, but I had failed this time.

It has been a couple days since the experience and all I can think about is the fact that it is entirely plausible I could have been exposed to something. Especially considering certain details, like him being just as spontaneous and risk-taking. 

I am ofcourse going to get a screening as soon as possible, but am aware HIV does not show it's signs for an extended time past exposure.. Which raises the question, how fearful/anxious should I be until I have the results? I've already started contemplating living life with the virus, and how big the impact could be. This is ofcourse terrifying, and emotionally draining. I'd also like to possibly hear scenarios of similar instances, and what the outcome was. I know it is illogical to think that the minimal exposure and running water could have meant decreased the chance dramatically, but it is my saving grace thought. My head has been riddled with anxiety, and browser riddled with questions. Is there a measure I could take immediately to help deter the possibility of this life-sentencing virus? I NEED to hear people's opinions on my scenario, and how to go about dealing with it. Possibly even someone that is HIV positive to hear how living life is.

Thankyou all so very much, and I hope I'm able to find some closure. Please excuse my grammar, it is 4 in the morning and I decided to post this just before bed. Thankyou, again."

Back in December 29th 2016 (during a HUGE lapse of judgement) I had unprotected sex, it was actually my first time having sex ever. My partner's dick penetrated my vagina but he never came because it hurt too much so we just stopped (although he penetrated me enough for me to bleed a bit). Exactly a week after this exposure I got all the flu-like symptoms (night sweats, severe sore throat, joint aches, fever). This caused me to freak out and I immediately made an appt for a full STD screening on January 12 2017. Everything came back negative. However, the sore throat came and went for over a month. It was the end of February when I started to feel a bit better again. I got re-tested 4th generation test (per the doctors suggestion) at 3 months (90 days post exposure) and it came back negative. It put my mind at rest. However, while away on vacation in the summer I developed a rash on my left arm and left back of the thigh that lasted two weeks. I immediately got scared and believed it had to be related to my exposure. I was in another country so I couldn't get tested. When I returned I got re-tested in October, rapid fingerprick test, and it came out negative. I know that after all these negative tests I should stop thinking it's HIV but I can't. I can't accept that it's not related to HIV or to my stupid mistake of having unprotected sex. I've never suffered so many symptoms before the exposure. I get colds and aches much more frequently then ever before in my life. I've had a cold with yellow phelgm for over a month now and had a swollen lymph node since january. I don't know what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I haven't told anyone in my life about this. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to reach out to the partner or if I even should because I have tested negative. I feel crazy. The partner and I don't speak anymore, he did tell me he had been tested negative for all stds but that had been earlier in the year(jan 2016). He is a free spirit and it wouldn't be crazy if he was bisexual and didn't tell me. Not that it's a bad thing. Ugh, I'm crazy. 

TL;DR - had unprotected sex, experienced tons of symptoms, low immune system, yet still tested negative. "

I’m a 21 year old Latina female and I made a reddit account because I just wanted to vent; not that any of you really care. I made a really bad decision last year in October when I decided to go out to a club with my coworkers and drink ( I drank 7 shots to be exact). I had recently turned 21 and broken up with my boyfriend of 3 years so why not? Anyways, I ended up meeting a guy (Latino) at the club and we were just hanging out all night. I don’t really know how it happened but we ended up having unprotected vaginal sex. It lasted about 2-5 minutes because he ejaculated really fast. He did pull out but I’m still scared because there could have been an exchange of Precum. Some of my coworkers personally know this guy, and say he is heterosexual and a non iv drug user. He also recently got out of a long term relationship. I texted him and asked him for plan b just in case of anything and he went out of his way and drove 20 minutes to bring me it. I thought it was nice because he was a stranger and he could have easily said no. A couple of days later, I really started to freak out because I started thinking about how I didn’t know anything about his status. I have only been with 2 other men who were both virgin before me. In other words, I would have never slept with this guy if I wasn’t drunk. I texted him and asked him if there was anything that I should be worried about and he told me that he works for a hospital and that he gets a lot of health checkups. He told me that he would go get tested and show me his results and that I was over thinking it. I did end up stalking him on Instagram which did confirm that he does work at the hospital. My friends thought that it would be best if I blocked him and went on my own to get tested. I went 2 weeks after and took an antibody rapid test but, of course, tested negative. The three past months have been so hard because I have had weird symptoms. 

Symptoms:
1) I had a mild yeast infection a week after incident. (Which I am hoping was due to taking Plan B. I was supposed to get my period that week and I think the pill threw my hormone balance off. Plus, I was douching with how disgusted I was in myself, which I think made it worse)
2) I got a minor cold, but everyone around me had a cold. I got the cough, phlegm, runny nose 
3) I started to feel dizzy for a few weeks
4) muscle aches 
5) I thought I had oral thrush but I bought a tongue scraper and my tongue went back to normal 
6) minimal mouth ulcers and body rash (but these are quite normal for me. I have eczema) 
7) I got a weird lump by my ear but everyone has inspected it, and apparently it looks like a scab or scratch 

None of these symptoms have been severe. I have a really weak immune system because I’m always getting sick so I would think if it was HIV, it would be way worse. I’m really hoping that all of these symptoms are because of my health anxiety. It has already been the 3 month period so I am going tomorrow morning to be tested. I am so scared, even though I have already looked up statistics on CDC. I’m afraid that maybe this guy isn’t aware of his status yet &amp; that I will be one of those very unlucky numbers. 

I know it sounds so silly. I just really wanted to vent. I’ve researched HIV like never before and I know it’s not a death sentence but my family would never understand this (being that they are a very traditional Christian Hispanic family)

Wish me the best of luck, I need it!  

Btw, I’m from Ventura county, California where HIV prevalence is low."

Herpies - people say it's not so serious and that most of them does not even show the symptoms and that it is not something you should be scared to death of, although of course you should prevent it as much as you can like any other diseases.

HPV - isn't curable either but I learnt that the body fights it off eventually if you keep your immune systems good.

I'm 22, she's 23 and we're both clean from STD's. The girl I got with, I met through a dating app. After talking for a day she invited me over when we was both drunk, she only lived 2 miles away. Once I arrived she didn't look too much like her pics, and it became quickly apparent she was a little messed up, she's 24 and renting alone, she was nice but just a little rough and admitted to some mental illness, I also saw a couple of cuts on her arms which seemed like self-harming. We had unprotected sex, the reason why is simply because I've never had sex with a condom, I can't function with one and me and my Ex never used it, so after some more drinks we pretty much erupted into sex, both really horny it was great, and two days later we did again, only vaginal and oral.

I've being extremely paranoid since, especially seeing as I'm now back with my LTR girlfriend. We've had sex many times, but once thing I've noticed is I've been ill with a cold three times and I'm incredibly paranoid I've caught HIV. I know it's irrational, I contacted this girl and quizzed her on whether she was clean and if she'd been checked, she said she had and she's fine, but I simply don't trust her word due to her demeanor, saying that I know where she lives and it would take an extremely immoral person to spread something like that without any warning. I'm being super paranoid because I don't trust her and I usually don't get ill multiple-times in such a short period, I don't think I've EVER been ill and then caught something a couple of weeks later again, let alone three times in a month. But if you're in the UK you will know that this has been the craziest period for flu viruses to be going around, almost EVERYBODY has been ill within the last month, especially over Xmas. I have no symptoms down below, the only thing which as played on my mind is the amount of times I keep catching colds. Three times in a month. Although one of those times was from my LTR when we got back together. 

I've done a Chlamydia test, and I'm going to get a full scan done ASAP. This girl I had sex with is white, young and was very nice when I was with her. I'm just super paranoid I may have caught something and passed it on, even if I've caught chlamydia and passed it on to my LTR it would be over between us, because she put me in a corner and said if I'd slept with someone during the break-up it's over for good, so I said no. It's a bit of a messed up situation and I have a horrible gut-feeling/anxiousness that I've fucked my life up, it's just my luck. Do you think I'm just being mega-paranoid, I mean HIV is super-rare right and typically only prominent in the gay community and African, I will get checked but for peace of minds sake until then can someone give me some words of wisdom. I know I made some mistakes, but my situation was emotionally screwed up and difficult right from the moment I lost my LTR, I was heartbroken yet curious to explore, combined with the fact I'd never experienced another partner, and then the emotional cornering my LTR put on me has landed me here. Please help guys :( It'd be much appreciated. 

Also it's not just me that has been ill, my two housemates have also been consistantly ill with a couple of colds etc. As well. I've also been drinking a lot on the weekends which obviously weakens your immune system.  "

Now, I was tested, and the tests came out negative. I think the last one happened three months after the fact, and even then, it was negative.

Here's the thing:

* Sex was unprotected

* Went down on her

Then I read that there's often a six month period before the blood test shows up as positive. She wasn't bleeding or anything, but I read that HIV is also transmittable through vaginal fluid. So what if?

She also told me she was STD free, and I don't have herpes or anything, so maybe I'm just being paranoid. Still, I'm pretty on edge right now."

My latest partner (we haven't done anything sexual yet) was telling me that she was tested recently and takes solace in knowing that she's completely clean. It got me thinking - could I have an STD and not know it??? So many STDs (and HIV) are asymptomatic, or at least that's what Google says?

I haven't had sex in 4 years, and when I did, it was always protected. The riskiest thing I've ever done is let someone cum in my mouth - once. This person, that came in my mouth, sometimes had cold sores, but only on his mouth, never on his junk. He got cold sores from his aunt kissing him as a baby, not from anything sexual. In 4 years since dating him, I've never had a cold sore on my mouth.

SO, I guess I'd like to know the odds, because now I'm overthinking things and wondering if there's a chance that I have an STD? I feel fine, but is it possible? I made an appointment at PP to do a screening but it's not until the 28th so I guess I'm just wondering what the odds are? Should I be worried?

I had sex with a friend of a friend who seemed pretty normal, and stupidly (because I have contraception and haven't needed to factor in risk of STDs ever before) did NOT use a condom. I wasn't too worried, but then my friend told me that he's been sleeping with a lot of people since breaking up with his girlfriend and I assume he doesn't use a condom with any of them either as he didn't want to with me. She also said there's a rumour that he has chlamydia. Chlamydia I can handle- it would be unfortunate and I'd definitely be disappointed in myself for practising unsafe sex in such a dumb way- but I'd manage as it's treatable. What I'm really terrified of is HIV. I know this is neurotic, but I can't get the notion out of my head that I've contracted it. I'm obsessed and can't eat or sleep. I'm feeling run down and tired, could these be symptoms of seroconversion?
Basically, does anyone know how likely it is I've contracted it? He's a white British male, 26yo, middle class, doesn't use intravenous drugs, but I have no idea what his sexual code of conduct is- promiscuous from what I hear.

Before I get castrated yes I did read the wiki but am just looking for some more assurance to ease my anxiety.

If it matters, 23 y/o Male. Only one previous sexual partner and I suffer from PE mostly due to years of death grip and ""time convenient"" masturbation.

Next week I am meeting with an old friend and she is coming over. She's made it very clear that she wants to have every kind of sex and said that shes always wanted to for years and doesn't care about my lack of experience or issues. Always avoided this hook up due to my anxiety because of lack of experience and the PE.

Anyway she's most definitely had many more sexual partners than I have and to be honest probably above the average amount most people have. I know she has definitely had protected and unprotected sex many times and this is where fear strikes. I kind of want this to be a one time hook up and I'm definitely going to wear protection but as for Oral can anything permanent be transmitted such as HIV? I'll be honest Im 99% sure she doesn't have any sort of STI but theres always that lingering thought that is making me want to cancel but I feel as though I need this as a step through to win over my fears.

Mods, if this post isn't up to par I apologize and feel free to remove it. Otherwise help a brotha out."

In 1-2 of these cases I had a small wound at the top of my crotch area - almost like a popped pimple on your face kind of wound. Would that be a possible transmission zone? I read that for wounds to really cause any risk of HIV, it'd need to be significant enough that it'd be bleeding a lot. 

Overall, I'm starting to get really worried if I contracted HIV in any of the encounters. If it's relevant, I don't think I've developed any other STD (itches or sores) after any of them and it's been a couple of months from the last encounter.

From what I read is that in general there is little to no risk of getting HIV from oral sex, but transmission of HIV, though extremely rare, is theoretically possible if an HIV positive man ejaculates in his partner's mouth during oral sex. 

I'm scared that the test wasn't accurate because maybe it was too soon and it didn't detect it. And some people don't get any flu-like symptoms. Am I just being crazy? I have exams soon, and this is fucking up my life.. "

I yelled ""pull it out, I'm not doing anything without a condom"" but he ignored me and I couldn't get him off of me. He keeps going inside me for a few thrusts and then pulls out and masturbates for about 30 seconds before cumming on me. He came on my ass, but I really don't think any got inside.

This was about a week ago, and I still feel pretty shaken, and I'm getting increasingly nervous that something could have been transmitted.

I am a gay 27 years old and from a conservative &amp; religious background so I am not someone with a lot of sexual experience. I only had sex with one ex five years ago and have had very few hook ups. However, the few I have hooked up with have sorta left me with a lot of anxiety.

I was semi dating a guy 4 years ago who, while he was incredibly attractive, was a bit of a douchebag. We ended up hooking up one night and we almost had sex but I did not want it to go so far so he stopped. He shorty after got back with his ex  so I stopped talking to him, especially since was often manipulative. He then continues messaging me and to get me to talk to me he says, ""it is urgent, it is about a test"". I call him frightened and he tells me he took an ""IQ test"" and found out he has a high IQ. I told him off and told him how sick that was and blocked his number.

One year later, I began talking to another guy who was very sweet and had an incredible personality. He was great - professional, family oriented, sweet, etc. We ended up messing around once, and then the next day, tells me out of the blue that he has HIV... I felt uneasy. This wouldn't have stopped me from dating him, but I was put off by the fact that he did not tell me this before we messed around. I realize the chances of me getting HIV are slim, but I almost went all the way with him and he was not stopping me (I stopped because I remembered my past experience). I got tested and fortunately, I was negative.

Fast forward to now many years later.... I went on a date with a guy about three weeks ago from my school. We ended up messing around, and while I was laying down, he went on top of me and grabbed my penis and inserted it inside him. I did not have a condom and this was definitely more than I bargained for, but I didn't stop it. I asked him afterwards if he was clean and he told me he was. I asked him a little later *again* and he said ""yes... are you?"" And I told him I was. Fast forward to this past week and I've had a light sore throat for days that has gotten a bit better and sneezing/mucus in the throat. I have high energy and no rashes, but I guess you could say I am paranoid now after all sexual experiences. I realize I am probably negative, but I just wanted to ask because I want to get a different POV and overcome this anxiety."

I had that regret from the next day. I started getting worried about health issues. 

I already was facing stomach issues prior to that and at the 4th week mark, I had pain on my upper left back for about 24 hours. It wasn't much , but I could feel it all day long, and had to think before moving. 

I had blamed it to my weird sleeping postures and then at 6 week mark I had a similar pain but  on my should instead of my back. I had dislocated my collar bone about 6 years ago and its been fine ever since and the pain I feel is more on the shoulder not on the collar bone section. 

I do not have any other symptoms like fever, headaches or anything. I feel super mildly dizy but that is also a listed side affect of medicine I m taking for my stomach issues.

I started getting a little worried and opt in for a complete blood test and test for every STD(s) and I got negative results in all of them which is good. I think it is only been 6 weeks, and I dont know for sure which type of test I went through. 

Now my question is: 

Q) What are the chances the results could be a false negative specially for HIV? As I got a anitbody test most proly at about 6-7 Weeks mark 

Q) Should I go for viral load test ( It is expensive where I live)?  Or am i just being paranoid ?

Q) Should I wait for few more weeks and a get checked again? 

Also, Please give constructive responses only !

I told him never but I used a condom, but he told me until I get tested he won’t have sex with me. I took the HIV exam and it was clear and he told me I’m suppose to get the overall test but is willing to have sex with me. He then asked me a bunch of questions about how many people I had sex with after 90 days (since the test only detects 90 days). He said he is down but didn’t talk to me afterwards

I later took the HIV and STD test with a better HIV test that detects 30 days. I showed him the results and that’s when he is willing to have sex 

Here are some red flags tho.

When I asked him for his results he said he gets them over the phone, so he can’t show me. Idk if that’s believable or not. He had alopecia on his facial hair and I read HIV can have symptoms of alopecia. He also told me it’s easy to get HIV (tho it isn’t according to statistical studies) and only a person with it will think that 

So I made the mistake to get drunk when having sex because there are things I don’t remember. I remember him putting the condom on the first time, and then he told me he had to put another one on (forgot why... I think it was because it was starting to wear out). I don’t remember him putting another one on because I was drunk 

However when I asked him for round 2 he said he has no more condoms and will only have sex with me raw if I took the test again and it have sex in 30 days 

Now in my head I’m thinking maybe he is playing the “did you get tested game” so that if I do get it, he will be the least person I expect to give to me. 

Another issue when I went to the bathroom, I noticed bleeding which is weird because I’m not a virgin and my Period finished a week ago. It’s scary because if he has HIV, he can easily put it in my blood stream since I was bleeding. This is scary

I want to know before I go in tomorrow how are my chances of being hiv+. I know there is always a possibility and I’m going with the thought that I could have it but to me hiv is so serious and I’m scared for tomorrow.   

I had sex the last time almost a year ago in August 2017. It was my first boyfriend that I had sex with and he was from another country [Kuwait-I’ll explain this later]. We had sex a few time and it was always either me performing oral on him without a condom and he would cum. Or we would have P in V sex ALWAYS with a condom he was very good about since I wasn’t on birth control. So we only were together a few months and before we broke up he went back to his country Kuwait and when he came back I performed oral sex and then he broke up with me [yeah I know]. At the time I thought nothing of anything until now as I have a new boyfriend.    

So fast forward to now I’ve been with my current boyfriend sexually about 3 months. I decided to go on birth control since we became more serious and at planned parenthood they took my urine sample the they asked me if I wanted to send it in for std testing so I said yes. I got a call back that I was positive for gonorrhea. Because I was positive I told my boyfriend and he went to get tested and cured. The doctor said since we were together that long he would most likely be positive. A few days later they call him to tell him he was completely clean and that meant I would’ve carried it for almost a year!! He believes that it was a false positive so I’m mad I didn’t get retested. Anyways because of this he wanted to get tested for everything blood test and all, he came back clean for all of that as well. So now that he brought this up I am now completely terrified that if I had gotten gonorrhea then was else could I have gotten?   

Is it normal to feel this nervous about getting this test done? How high are these chances and should I not feel so scared?   

I’m so terrified to hear the results but honestly even more I’m scared to have a positive result and need to end my relationship with current boyfriend."

It’s not until I started thinking about it more and know the consequences of it (regardless of treatment the stigma is still there, medication is expensive if you don’t have insurance, disappointment with family, dating pool shrinks, your sexual value decreases, etc etc)

Looking at it statistically less than .01% of the population of any state has HIV. And since I’m a straight girl I got to take to consideration that a good chunk of the that small population are gay bisexual men....so it becomes even a smaller population. But when then I fear this “what if I’m that one?” Sometimes I want to know other things that that are a greater risk than HIV that I do almost daily and end up okay lol

I’m still waiting on my HIV RNA results which may come tommorow. The reason why I took the RNA test is because of this dude who blocked me on snap and put his insta on private because I questioned him about whether or not he was honest about getting blood work is requirement when being discharged (people told me it wasn’t true so I got nervous)

However there is a part of me that’s still worries about this guy I recently hooked up with who told me when he got tested (Ik people lie so I only took it as a grain of salt) and we used a condom. However when I got home I was checking my mouth for cuts and I notice a tiny scratch on my inner cheek that isn’t bleeding nor it hurts. Like when I rub my tongue against my cheek I feel this tiny bit of texture which I think is slightly raised skin from scratch. This scared me because I did oral and even tho hiv from oral is unlikely it doesn’t take acccout to if it has cuts or not

Anyways I deleted my tinder and I talked to him before deleting my tinder so that’s why I still wanted to hookup. I wish I catch the tiny painless scratch in my inner cheek tho

Yep. I’m worried, scared and anxious and have been for a while. I really want some answers to an encounter I had almost a month ago and have no one to talk to about this, so any legit help would be much appreciated.

I had been ‘serviced’ by an escort in the UK. Vaginal sex. Protected, but there’s a slight hiccup. So we were going at it for a minute or two, then I notice this weird smell, a fishy like, weird puss-like smell or yeast-y smell. Her vagina started to release this whitish yellowish foam like discharge which got on my protected little man. However the discharge was also on the end of the condom near the base of my little soldier and I think it was touching my skin, whether the discharge could have seeped under the condom at the base of my peen and then moved inside toward the tip, is just one of the possibilities. 

Anyway, I stopped after a few seconds of realizing that this was a rather unpleasant situation to be in, and without finishing myself, I exited her body, took the protection off, wiped my trooper off with a wet wipe and left. - the tip in the condom seemed to be dry ( I had not ejaccied) so it didn’t seem any of h er secretions had got in. Some could’ve been left on my balls and then infected me after I left.

What was wrong with her? What was that vaginal discharge? And what are my risks? I immediately thought she had a disease, that’s why she has weird discharge and now thats got all over my privates, I’m at risk of whatever she has got. 

Anyway that was around 3 weeks ago, and now I have flu like symptoms, fatigue, I had a whiteish tongue for a few days.  Sore ish throat and blocked nose

Anyone with some knowledge on the matter please let me know, cuz in all seriousness I’m actually really scared, I feel terrible for doing something so wrong.

I'm an HIV+, undetectable, healthy guy in his 20s who (to this point) has primarily been interested in men. Recently I've gotten curious, and I'm really wanting to give having sex with women another chance. 

I can't seem to get lucky though! I've been using dating apps, and I'm always very open and forward about my status. When I have my status in my bio I don't really get responses from women, and but when I keep it private and tell them after we've chatted for a while I usually get ghosted. It doesn't seem to help when I offer to answer questions or help direct them to some accurate information if they aren't informed. 

I don't think it's my personality or looks driving women off. I've had several healthy relationships, keep a good circle of friends, and usually don't have any problems finding guys to have casual fun with when I want to. 

Anyone have any advice? I've never really been given trouble for having HIV by the gay community, but this is really starting to wear on me :-("

I am now freaking out with a possibility of having AIDS to the point that now I barely function in normal life. I do not know if am paranoid or going crazy, but that's how I am right now. I also think I might have seriously upset the girl. 

So more details  - we only had \*\*protected\*\* PIV sex twice at her place with me using (poor quality, but still) condoms in both cases.  I am more or less sure that condoms didn't slip or break, but since I was a bit drunk I can't say I remember for sure. The whole night seems like a haze and I honestly cringe when thinking about it. 

I am generally quite a hypochondriac and do worry excessively about my health. I also do know that contracting HIV is not that easy and even harder when using condoms, but I still can't help but feel serious anxiety. I want to undergo testing, but I'll probably will have to wait a couple of weeks(?) for it to be effective. 

I would like to ask for advice here. Should I immediately go to the doctor or I am really stretching here and being excessively paranoid? Is there any way to reduce anxiety and fear if I really am paranoid?

I have been to the doc and he found a M.genitalium infection (NGU) which could explain some of the symptoms. I got antibiotics for it.

Hey everyone I'm new to this forum just over 4 weeks ago me and the boys went on a stag do, we ended up at a strip club where I met this girl who squeezed her way in between us as we sat around a large sofa having the best of times. She immediately starting talking to me out of the group, obviously showing interest and made it clear to me that she was only a hostess and that this was her first night working at the strip club and said she was ""nervous"" so I took her word for it as the naive tourist I am. She then told me she hasn't eaten in a day so I offered to buy her food to which she agreed but that I couldn't be seen leaving the place with her as her boss would get mad so she went out first after her shift finished and I followed suite. I popped into the shop and got her some water and a sandwich to eat, It was the only thing opened at 5AM. We sat and talked for about an hour on a summer bench and by that stage the sun started to come up, one thing lead to another and we ended up back at my hotel and couldn't do much as my two friends were sleeping so she asked me did I want to go to the bathroom. I obviously agreed and we started kissing, then I asked if she had a condom and she said no, I then remember vividly sitting there with my arms folded and told her we couldn't do anything then so 5 mins pass by and it's getting slightly awkward and she turns around and was like ""okay, I think I have a condom!"" (weird) she pulls out a Durex condom, a recognised brand that I never had a problem with in the past. I looked at the condom packet, everything seemed good and it didn't expire to 2021.

I go to put on the condom and she tells me to turn off the light, I thought nothing of it, so we go at it for a good 10 minutes, later when it was over with I turn on the light to find that the entire head of condom had been exposed, that the little tip at the top of the condom wasn't there, might as well had no condom on, to make matters worse she was bleeding (heavily) my initial reaction was ""what the actual fuck!"" I was in shock but I still never gave HIV a second thought because not once in my tiny mind did I think she could have been a prostitute and still if she was working in this place surely they screen the girls and safe sex is a priority with clients. I then asked her immediately if she had any STD's and her response was ""I'm not a prostitute!"" she didn't take kindly to my question but I did press her on it there and then. After that she left and I thought nothing of it, I still had 2 days left in Poland (Krakow) that is until I got home and started to become very ill, within the space of 4 days after that initial encounter, I started Googling my symptoms and then freaked out that I'm showing symptoms of HIV and that this could have all been a malicious act on her part, the more I started to think about the circumstances surrounding everything the more I began to lose my mind. I remember thinking how odd it was for the condom to break in that way, as it was the first time it had ever happened especially with a Durex condom, so I kept it instead of throwing it away because of how unusual it was despite me using condoms for years. However, I remember I made sure to get her Instagram name before she left and doubled checked to see if that was her and I still remember thinking if she had anything to hide surely she wouldn't give me her details so like I said I thought nothing of it. I contacted her after I get home and start questioning her, she tells me that I'm a jerk and she doesn't want to talk to me, I thought what???! I tell her that I'm incredibly sick of which she showed no sympathy and then I asked openly if she had any STD's to try and settle my mind, she tells me to go see a doctor and that her health was ""ok!"". I keep pressing and she tells me she got checked in February and didn't believe me when I said she was my only sexual partner in months. I keep pressing after 2 weeks I then threaten to get the police involved, she goes for a HIV test (p24 antigen) which is basically for anyone who has just caught the virus, this test isn't accurate for someone who's had the disease for a while which in any case she would need an antibody test anyway she shows me that it's negative that clears my mind for a few days until I do my research. I tell her to go and do an antibody test, she refuses and tells me she's healthy until I tell her how sick I am and then she tells me that she has HIV, Hepatitis and Syphilis. This sent my mind spiralling out of control, I asked her why she did this to me and she said that I deserved it like who in their right mind says something like that then she accuses me of rape which is far from the truth and something I'm not worried about at all.

When I got sick I immediately went to A and E after the 4 days when I got home, I would have went to a GUM clinic at home only my nearest one only opened up on Mondays and Wednesdays and I unfortunately didn't know accident and emergency dealt with these issues. I get there and talk with a doctor and find out that I'm out of time to get pRep, a drug that stops HIV and must be taken within 72 hours of exposure and a drug that I never knew even existed, I thought once you got HIV that was it. I'm crying, I feel aches and pains all over my body, extreme fatigue and I sleep for 18 hours a day and having vivid nightmares of my ordeal, 1 week goes by and I can't keep food down, I go to another hospital they take bloods and check vitals signs, they don't know what's wrong and the male doctor there reassures me although I have swollen throat and be gives me antibiotics. Week 2- I phone an ambulance, after waking up at 4AM and feeling thirsty I go to get a glass of water only for my legs to collapse from underneath me with extreme weakness and heart pounding from my chest, the ambulance arrives they check the vitals etc and don't see any issues other than a fast heart rate. Eventually after 3 weeks I get to the GUM clinic, I meet this doctor and she also tries to reassure me after I tell her about my circumstances, I took an ELISA blood test that checks for antibodies but because it's 3 weeks it's too early to tell whether I've HIV or not. We don't have access to fourth generation tests on public healthcare so for now I have to rely on the oldschool ELISA test which can take the body up to 3 months to develop enough antibodies for the test to read. I've now been to 3 different hospitals, 2 doctors and called an ambulance, my general doctor has put me on antidepressants (sertraline) and given me valium. I have taken another antibody test at 4 weeks which is standard practice and waiting for the results. This has been beyond a absolute fucking living nightmare, my body is still aching and having this level of anxiety over my shoulders is something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, I literally want to die.

Hey everyone I'm new to this forum just over 4 weeks ago me and the boys went on a stag do, we ended up at a strip club where I met this girl who squeezed her way in between us as we sat around a large sofa having the best of times. She immediately starting talking to me out of the group, obviously showing interest and made it clear to me that she was only a hostess and that this was her first night working at the strip club and said she was ""nervous"" so I took her word for it as the naive tourist I am. She then told me she hasn't eaten in a day so I offered to buy her food to which she agreed but that I couldn't be seen leaving the place with her as her boss would get mad so she went out first after her shift finished and I followed suite. I popped into the shop and got her some water and a sandwich to eat, It was the only thing opened at 5AM. We sat and talked for about an hour on a summer bench and by that stage the sun started to come up, one thing lead to another and we ended up back at my hotel and couldn't do much as my two friends were sleeping so she asked me did I want to go to the bathroom. I obviously agreed and we started kissing, then I asked if she had a condom and she said no, I then remember vividly sitting there with my arms folded and told her we couldn't do anything then so 5 mins pass by and it's getting slightly awkward and she turns around and was like ""okay, I think I have a condom!""

The encounter started off consentual with vaginal and oral sex, then went VERY bad and turned into unwanted anal, where I bled and fluids were exchanged. All of these sexual acts were unprotected. The last couple of days have been absolute hell. I finally got my 30 day supply of Truvada and Tivicay at the 64 hr mark and i'm agonozing over the effectiveness of this medication. Any advice is so greatly appreciated. Could factors like my weight (280lbs at 5'2'') or weakened immunity or liver function from alcohol abuse make a difference?

I met this sex worker. Had sex. Condom broke right before I came. Stayed in there unprotected for &lt; 30 seconds. She said she doesn't have any infections. I'm very worried about getting HIV now. Walked into the emergency room, and the doctor said that my risk factor is minimal, ran some blood test for HIV, Hepatitis and others and all looked good. But the doctor said I must get tested again in 4 weeks because this is the window my body needs to develop antibodies to the virus. These will be some very stressful 4 weeks. What can I do now? I'm married and if I got this, it will probably ruin my life/marriage. Any tips to get through these 4 weeks please."

We always had sex with a condom, but one time(the LAST time)ended up doing it without one(under false pretenses on his part, without being too detailed).

I went to a sex clinic thing like 2-3 days afterwards and got tested, and was negative.

So my question is, can it likeee hide and grow then come up positive later? like can you get a false negative if you get tested that soon after the exposure?

She said she was clean, and got tested two weeks ago. But she also has had sex with two other guys within the past month, so if she caught something, the STD test might not have picked it up. She had a tongue piercing, that she said she got back in march. I had a canker sore that recently healed a few days prior. Im sure i am just being paranoid but I have had so much anxiety since the hook up. I know the likilihood of HIV is low, but i am still unsure based off the whole canker sore and tongue piercing, since blood could leak through the piercing or vaginal fluid can have gotten in the canker sore. I went to planned parenthood two days after to take and tested negative for HIV and am waiting on the results for the other STDS. I plan on going back 4 weeks after to take another test to be sure and will probably have anxiety until then. I'm just looking to strangers on reddit to help ease my anxiety."

Couple of days later I felt tired and a bit fatigued. Then I started to worry if I contracted any std.

12 Days after exposure: HIV 4th Gen. Test
20 Days after exposure: HIV RNA Early Detection Test
21 Days after exposure: HIV 4th Gen. Test + STD Panel (Chlamydia, Gonnorhea, and Syphilis)

I've received all of the results and they were negative. I'm just worried because I have a bit of a low grade fever that's not going away? And a bit of back pain every now and then. I went to the the doctor two weeks after the exposure and they found out my urine was high in leukocytes indicating an infection. He said it was UTI but after telling him about the encounter he said there was a small possibility of STD but unlikely HIV. After taking the UTI meds the back pain did subsided. 

Should I still worry? I'm still planning to get the test done at 45 and 90 days. Granted the stress/anxiety could have weakened my immune system, but any thoughts?"

I am a man and I had a vaginal and anal encounter on August 24 of this year and for a little over a week I am really worried about having contracted HIV and I just started thinking that because I have experienced quite noticeable hair loss at the top of my head. I have read every day on the internet and there are cases that relate alopecia and HIV or even Syphilis.

I had an OralQuick test of gums on October 19 and it turned out negative. I know very well that these types of rapid tests look for antibodies but they may not be as accurate because the antibodies can take up to 3 months to appear.

So I have the following questions.

1. How reliable is this negative result?
2. Can hair loss really be associated with these diseases?
3. Would hair loss be a symptom that HIV antibodies have already been generated in my body? Therefore, should the OralQuick test have been positive if I were really HIV positive?

Help please, I am waiting for the results of a 4th generation blood test that, as I was told, is very reliable after week 4. I can no longer wait for this, I am dying."

I am a HIV (or any other sexual disorders) clean male and had sexual activities with a female professional while I’m in Japan, because I can’t hold down my urges for which I slightly regret.

It is kinda embarrassing to go into details but we had protected vaginal intercourse, followed by oral sex with condom on, and then off, which was particularly lengthy.

Would I be too paranoid to think the virus from vaginal fluid might survive the journey from on the condom, to the inside of her mouth, and then to the penis membrane after condom got taken off.

2 months ago i started birth control so we started to have sex without condom (because i was a virgin before and i never had sex with somebody else while he told me that he never had a test but he always used condoms). Since then he is having musle pains, lack of breath that causes him to last shorter in bed, sore throath, weight loss and red skin on his penis and hands.

We thought it was an allergy or a flu so he didnt go to a doctor. Last night i searched about HIV because it was HIV day and i was curious, and saw he has all of the signs. 

I am anxious and dont know what to tell or ask for him to get a test because he can think that i am accusing him with cheating. Also, if he has HIV i definetely have too now. What should i do?"

I had sex with a girl yesterday. It was just a hook up, we didn’t know each other and it just happened. I always use a condom but this time it broke. I freaked out because this had never happened to me before. I pulled out immediately and went to wash off. Now that I think about it, it probably wasn’t the best look since the girl was on the same room but like I said, I freaked out. There was no ejaculation from either of us. The only fluid that may have been exchanged was her normal wetness

My question is, how likely is it that I caught something if I was only exposed for a stroke or two? Form what I’ve read it isn’t much but I still wanted to know your opinions.
Thank you to anyone who answers, Ive been nervous since the event because of all the horror stories."

Two days ago I met with a Brazilian acquaintance for sex. I was the passive partner.

I will cut to the chase. At first he tried to enter me without a condom and the tip of his penis had contact with my anus. Additionally, maybe a quarter or half of his penis went in but it didn’t go in all the way and wasn’t for a long time.

I then told him to withdraw and put on a condom which he did.

I’m now worried about my potential risk of HIV. One of the reasons is that he works as an escort (I didn’t pay anything). However, as part of his work he stated beforehand that he has medical monitoring (std checks etc) and is clean, and in addition he is on Prep.

The truth is however, I don’t know for sure if he’s been tested clean or uses Prep. Anyone can say this.

I wondered, if an uncovered penis partially enters me (a few inches maximum) and for a few seconds, what is my risk of STD and specifically HIV infection.

Please somebody try to give me an answer on this. One of my friends thinks it’s virtually nil and a lot more contact than this would be needed. In fact, a friend had a similar experience and was refused Pep on the grounds that it was not enough to constitute a risk or exposure.

Please are there any health professionals or informed redditors here who can help put my mind at rest?

I bottomed (douched beforehand) and made sure he put on protection (I have never had unprotected sex), but I have a feeling he took it off sometime during. This is because during it he said that something creamy was coming out of me so he stepped away to get a towel to clean up a bit and then came back. We continued and he said stuff was coming out, I went to look and some semen-like substance was coming out of me and it smelled just like it. He accused me of having had sex with someone right before (I didn’t!). We stopped as I was freaking out, he still had a condom on and that semen like substance was on the condom. He was acting kind of sketch and told me to leave and he never finished. But I feel like he took the condom off, came in me and then put the condom back on so I wouldn’t know. 

I came back home and checked and that semen-like substance is coming out? It looks and feels just like semen - could this be some other fluid? 

I’m freaking out because I messaged the guy asking if he was sure he didn’t ejaculate in me and he blocked me without answering. 

My world is crumbling down and I’m thinking of going into urgent care tomorrow AM and asking to be put on PEP.

Hi guys, For the last 4 months I've been racked with depression and anxiety. I had a low to medium risk HIV exposure and developed flu like symptoms 2 days later.

She said she was on PREP and had been tested for HIV recently.  I used a condom.

However, she also spoke very casually about meeting up with and having sex with men.

She did also give me oral sex with no condom.

I'll get tested for regular STD's in general, which is probably something I should do anyways but the way she spoke about being so sexually active just makes me really concerned.

Now my concern is, because i have a tiny sore on the inside of my upper lips, that there might've happened a HIV-transmission through her vaginal fluid (she wasnt craaazy wet but I really went ham on that thing), I was careful during sex, to only use my tongue and not my lips so the sore wouldnt open which didnt happen so theres no chance, that hiv entered my bloodstream through this tiny sore right? my paranoia kept going till today where I talked with her and asked, if she ever had unprotected sex with clients and she told me she would never do something like that, regardless of how much money somebodys offering and that she gets checked on everything every 3 months (even showed me her test which was negative on everything). she told me that this is her job and she takes hygiene very seriously and that she only has one body and her business would be ruined if she would get infected by hiv or some kinda shit, this sounded really logical for me. Though I was still paranoid and kept googling all kinds of stuff regarding hiv and I read, that theres basically no chance for HIV to enter your body through vaginal fluid in your mouth, because there cant be enough HIV in the vaginal fluid for an infection, even if you have an open sore in your mouth your saliva kills the virus off, only ejaculation in mouth is dangerous for the woman. I even talked to a friend, who told me that I shouldnt overthink that much, because theres practically no chance for an hiv infection, if I used a condom and even without, theres still a really slim chance for transmission. 

It ended up longer than I wanted it to be but thats my current situation. can you guys help me calm down or in the worst case even wake me up to go see a doctor or something. Im really struggling to focus on life right now, because I cant think about anything else other than this possible or maybe not possible hiv infection. please help me.

I’m just consulting here because I want further opinion, and unfortunately I can’t buy a test or get tested at the moment.

Fast forward, I returned back to my home country and I started feeling a little sick around the beginning of august and I developed a full blown sickness from the 12th to the 18th of August. I’m uncertain how high my fever was but I had swollen lymph nodes and swollen tonsils with white spots on them. I was prescribed amoxicillin, after which I had a hard time holding down water and I developed a rash around the end of the pills I had to take. At the time I just shrugged it off as traveling internationally but recently I started thinking about a possible connection there. So my questions to ya’ll are what are the chances of having received HIV from the activities I participated in and is white spots on my swollen tonsils typically seen in early HIV Infection?Any input would be greatly appreciated."

There are very few straight HIV+ men in my state, and most are over 60. So I don't feel like I can limit myself to that group. I feel like I'd have no choice but to be single forever.

The reason I question everyone's status is that no one gets tested, it seems. The dude I just hooked up with told me that his ex-MIL has HIV, which means his spouse could have been born with it. He said he gets tested every 3 months because it's included in routine bloodwork for migraine meds. No. It probably isn't. In America, HIV testing is not part of standard testing; you have to specifically ask for it. Even during an STI check. So he probably THINKS he's getting tested but isn't.

I asked him to use a condom but he didn't. So because we had unprotected sex, I'm on PEP now. And I'm so scared that my sex life is over if I get it. With how late I started PEP, it may not work.

The funny thing is that HIV doesn't have to wreck your health and doesn't need to be passed on. But the stigma makes me so scared to get it, and every time I ask people if they'd date a woman with undetectable HIV, the answer is ""fuck no."""

I'm 25 and I recently visited an escort who had a lot of partners, and I'm afraid I've contracted HIV.

We did mutual masturbation (however I haven't touched her vagina), swe jsut basically amsturbated and kissed. She sometimes used her mouth to lubricate her fingers before we kissed, however I haven't felt any strange taste while kissing. The reason I'm afraid I could have somehow contracted it is because I had a mouth ulcer (to be more specific, it is called ""contact ulcer"" and it is a small granuloma/ulcer near the vocal cord) which was not healing by that time, so it can be considered an open wound maybe?

Is it possible that some vaginal fluid got into her mouth and infected me through this wound, or it is highly unlikely?"

I spoke with an expert and she said the rate and conditions of STDs transfering do not necessarily mean you have been exposed. MG can be caught rubbing your tip outside the vagina, and other means, but HIV is very hard to catch compartively. And what other information has said when they said that it is easier to catch HIV when other STDs are present, does not mean ""you catch one STD, you catch them all at the same time (unless its like herpes or open sores, which I do not have)."" What it means is that if you have one STD, and let it linger, your immune system is compromised, making you more prone to getting HIV. It's like coughing on a normal person when one has pneumonia. You won't necessarily get it. But pneumonia cough on a person with a cold? they are more likely to get it. 

Is this true? What is my risk for HIV given all this? She still tests negative after two tests 8 days apart (shortening the window, but still an open risk)."

Hot but no fever? Chills, loss of appetite, and general fatigue that last more than a week??

But all I can wonder is how??? I had protected oral and vaginal sex with a sex worker, but the last moments as I was finishing I pull out and the condom stayed inside her and exposed me??? That was enough to infect me?? The odds of female to male transfer is 4 in 10,000 and even less when there’s a broken condom... why tf am I having these symptoms???

But that’s not it! I got infected with MGen... this confirmed fluid was transferred, and now the symptoms start to make sense... but you know what’s the kicker?? She was enthusiastic to take not just one take home hiv test, but two!! One a day after sex, and another 8 days later. And guess what? BOTH WERE NEGATIVE.

MGen is a bacteria std that is very common and easy to catch (one article state just rubbing outside the vagina is enough to get it) but can be cured with some antibiotics. They found this after taking urine sample and finding way too many white blood cells. HIV is a lot tougher to get... but fluid is fluid right, and the white blood cells were collecting to expose me faster to it, maybe??

I talked with SEVERAL experts on this and all of them focus more on the facts to assess my risk, rather than my symptoms. My very spot on symptoms for early HIV. They repeated more of the fact that I had protected sex throughout and female to male transmission is rare to where it’s not really applicable here. PEP was not recommended because of it and now I feel like an idiot for not taking it.

So there’s two scenarios running thru my mind right now:

1.) despite having two negative antibody tests, I got her right when she has a high enough viral load to transmit it, but early enough to where the antibodies were not forming. They symptoms are hiv, and I am guaranteed positive...

2.) Despite having MGen and symptoms, there is just no way there was a transmission due to the facts. My symptoms are some other viral illness, along with the anxiety and antibiotics that are just making it worse. Despite all this, I should have anything to worry about, as my risk is “virtually nonexistent” (as one of the experts stated).

I get my RNA test results Tuesday or Wednesday (9 days after exposure)... what do you all think my risk is?"

So, anyway, I know that it’s very unlikely to get HIV from giving oral, but is slightly more likely if you have open cuts/sores in your mouth.

Anyways, I’m 23 Male. About a week ago I was very drunk and ended up having sex with a female stranger who was on her period. 

Details are fuzzy but what I do remember is I tried to get hard and put on a condom, but due to the alcohol, I got soft while my penis was in her vagina, and the condom slipped. I didn’t realize it had slipped and kept trying to put my semi-flaccid penis back in her vagina, until I realized that I didn’t have a condom on. I did not finish inside her. 

These past few days I’ve been a nervous wreck. I don’t know her HIV status (we’re both in the Pacific Northwest of the US). She is 21. 

What scares me is:
1. My penis was sort of in her vagina without a condom. 
2. This happened while she was on her period which means HIV risk is higher if she was infected. 
3. I woke up about ten days after that specific potential exposure with a mild sore throat and cough.  I don’t know if it’s related or not, could be just due to smoking weed, but maybe the start of an acute HIV infection?

And now I have to wait another two weeks to take a test, I don’t know how I’m going to survive these next two weeks, I’m freaking out.

Given that my health insurance covers for such expenses, testing is never a problem for me. Also, even without an insurance, one can get a free one upon contacting the respective authorities. He said it would be inconvenient to him and his insurance does not cover the fees. Then I did a basic googling and linked him just where he can get tested and who to contact for a free checkup.  Even if he does not want the free version, it's only about 20bucks. not  a big deal given he also said he'd be willing to visit me in a city where i currently am and traveling also costs some money, probably more than 20.  
Am I overstepping for asking a test even for sex with condoms?  Did i come off too rude and pushy with providing links and all?

I got head from him but being drunk, it escalated and I fucked him in the ass but only for about a minute when I came inside him. He left and I felt immediate regret and feel so fucking stupid. 

Now after this, I got a home test and was negative for Gonorrhoea and Chlamydia but my blood samples got messed because I accidently got water in them so I didnt get certain results when tested for HIV, hepatitis B and syphillis. 

Today i woke up and I have a few blisters on my lip but theyre very small but I always hav dryness around my lip anyways. And I noticed some dry, peeling skin on my dick (not around the tip, but along the dick in the middle). The dry skin and peeling has happened many times to me before either from dry masturbating or or just on its own so its not unusual to see it but the timing is scary. And to add to that, there is some swelling under my chin. I have no other symptoms though, I am fever free, theres no lumps on my dick ect ect.

If any additional information helps, I've been circumsized, there were no cuts on my dick when we fucked and his ass was not tight so there was no tearing and he was very loose so there was no blood but im hoping that that has reduced my chances but I still wanna know what my chances of having HIV are so any information would be very helpful.

I am already planning to get tested again but I'm hoping it's all just dumb chance and would just would like some peace of mind until then, if theres any peace to be had."

2 weeks ago I met a guy and we kissed for a brief moment. I wasn’t really into it but went along with it and probably engaged in around 10 seconds of ‘deep kissing’. I say deep kissing because it wasn’t a peck on the lips, it was more of a gentle lip caressing kiss with hardly any tongue. 

Normally I’d walk away from something like this and move on with my life, especially since I know a lot of people will freely kiss strangers (nightclubs, bars, apps). I stupidly ended up googling HIV/kissing transmission risks and some sources suggested there could be theoretical transmission if both parties had blood/sores/wounds present. Well, this panicked me a lot because from time to time I have been susceptible to bleeding gums upon brushing - nothing extreme but maybe a little bit of blood when I spit after being particularly rough... then I thought to myself wow I brushed my teeth about 40 minutes prior to meeting this guy. However, I did make sure to brush quite gently and don’t recall blood on this occasion, though who knows since I didn’t have a microscope and maybe the bleeding could have started a little while after the brushing... 

Anyway, all this googling after the incident caused me to head to the clinic first thing in the morning to get on PEP (for those who don’t know, it is a drug that can be taken after a potential exposure to HIV and can prevent the virus from infecting). It worked out I had taken my first dose of PEP 15 hours after exposure which is considered good timing (maximum 72 hours)

I felt happy with my precautious measures at first, but now my throat has started to become quite dry. I seem to have a tickly cough when I inhale/exhale and I’m swallowing a lot. When I open my mouth wide the back seems quite red. I’m really worried these are symptoms of HIV and I can’t seem to convince myself otherwise. I am thinking about it ALL DAY. I am so worried because I have to wait until the end of July before a test would be reliable. No idea how to cope in the meantime...

Am I being ridiculous? I have called the NHS and Terrence Higgins Trust helpline and they have both said it didn’t pose a risk unless there was lots of blood... obviously there wasn’t but I just think it only takes a small amount of that ‘lots of blood’ argument to infect someone.

Given that we’ve talked in an incredibly candid sense about having sex (with our texts leaving very little to the imagination) for me this does complicate things somewhat and did scare me a bit.

I have looked at the NHS website and educated myself about what it really means, and it seems like in practice it isn’t likely to put my safety at risk. I am also grateful to this girl for bringing it up before having any form of sex (rather than telling me afterwards and giving me the shits). However, as I don’t know her very well yet, I am left wondering what is reasonable for me to do and ask of her without pushing things too far. I don’t want to get involved with her only to be told that it is much more serious and that my safety is at risk, but at the same time I’ve also decided that it’s not a complete dealbreaker if what she has told me is absolutely correct (and there is consistency between what she told me and what is in the NHS website).

Just out of curiosity:
1. If somebody was to give you their NHS number, would you be able to take it to a GP and they could look it up on the system and confirm information such as this, or is this not allowed?
2. Suppose I was to do some sexual things with this girl (but not vaginal). What are some precautions I can take to put my mind to rest?
3. Alternatively, is the safest option just to run a mile?r"

And before you say this is biggoted or whatever.. dude I'm not a biggot or a judgemental person at all, it's fine.. look, I'm trans.. but honestly this should be a reminder for everyone to practice safe sex, everyone that has HIV or something looks 100% normal, the steriotypes are completely FALSE, just a reminder to you.

I trust her, we have been together for nearly 3 years, so it's my anxiety speaking.
BUT, would it be possible to transmit HIV if you first have sex, then touch the condom, and then touch your partner's genital?
We have always been careful with hygiene, always washed our hands and genitals after sex. 
But I just can't shake this anxiety off my back.

We both decided to get tested and I never gotten tested before and was just curious. 

Got the results back from a lab that I had went to after ordering the test online and I’m hella lost and confused. 

For some reason I do have herpes 2 even though I do have a history of cold sores near the corner of my mouth. Now for the HIV part is confusing and I really need someone to explain it to me please.

On the HIV 4th Gen it said that I’m reactive and nonreactive and for the HIV ab thing says that I’m abnormal but for the regular HIV1/2 it says I’m nonreactive and inconclusive.

What the heck does all of this mean? I truly want to get retested cuz that’s scary results and I don’t recall being near any blood or needles and haven’t had sex yet..  

Any advice  that it could be a false positive?"

At the time it sounded like a good idea and I didn't have a worry on my mind but now that I've sobbered up I'm actually panicking a bit. We met up and she started with a blowjob and I made sure I put on a condom. Honestly even in a drunken state I still tried to be very cautious knowing she does what she does for a living everyday. Now I'm panicking that because her teeth were putting pressure on the condom it might've actually damaged it in a way and allowed the exchange of fluids during intercourse since I didn't change the condom. We banged for a good 25 mins but towards the end I tried cumming on her face and she took off the condom but I wasn't 100% ready to bust just yet and told her to put it back on and suck me off for a few mins. She put it back on and here is where the confusion started after sobbering up. If she put the condom back on me inside out, meaning the outside part had her fluids on it, is there a high chance that in the 2-3 minutes that she sucked me off I could've gotten the virus? Even if it wasnt put on inside out, some of her fluids on the inside could've gotten in the inside part of condom and could that make me catch the virus? Or maybe when she rubbed her vagina she could have some fluids on her fingers and her putting it back on me could make me catch it? I'm legit panicking right now and my insurance is in the process of getting approved so PEP is out of the question. Any thoughts or suggestions?"

Hey guys, so I’m 19F and a few days ago (Monday) I started feeling kinda under the weather. The next day I had a wicked sore throat, pounding headache, and my body was changing from hot to cold by the minute. (I woke up several times in the night, which is not normal for me even when I’m sick.) 

Now I’m terrified that I have HIV because I realized that those symptoms appeared within the 2-4 week time frame of having unprotected sex a few times with a guy I don’t really know. (I know, that’s like the stupidest thing you can do, but my relationship with sex and my body is not the best and I did tell him I wanted him to wear a condom but he kept shrugging it off and I just kind of submitted to it😓). Are there any other more common infections that could cause this?! Anything at all? Here are some other facts about my case:

•had some gnarly itching around the time of the hookups, but I chalked it up to hair regrowth
•had some bloody discharge for a couple days at same time of itching
•itching and bleeding went away after doing a Monistat1 treatment
•I am vaccinated against Covid19 (got tested yesterday just in case, but results not in yet)

Is there any way that it’s more likely something besides HIV? I’m supposed to get a test tomorrow but I’m so terrified I can’t sleep :("

When we finally called I mentioned it and he said he wasn’t mad at me and that everything was fine, but through the tone of his voice i could tell it wasn’t. I felt like there was something he wasn’t telling me.

Anyways I asked him if he was sick as he was coughing a bit on the phone. He said yeah he was. Then i started asking him if he took anything for it he said yeah. I told him he should go see the doctor especially since 2 weeks ago he was sick as well and didn’t see a doctor for that. He said no. So i kept asking why. He wouldn’t answer and just give me vague answers but i kept pushing.

After what seemed like forever i found out he was afraid of getting an Std test, specifically for Hiv. He even refused to say the word ‘hiv’, he said the one that starts with the letter h and ends in v. Because right before he got sick me and him had seen each other and i had given him oral. The 2 weeks prior when he was sick he was a bit worried about this same stuff because he had given me oral before that. He basically started having this std fear since me and him started getting sexual. I should mention that both him and I are virgins. We haven’t even slept with each-other. Both only have kissed other people before.

Due to his worry I him to get tested, he said no because he’s too afraid. Then he asked me if i could get tested. I laughed and told him that I’m clean but if he wanted me to get tested i would. He felt bad about asking me but told me that after seeing the test results he will feel much secure.

Right after, i contacted a clinic and set up an appointment to have the blood test done. My bf only wants me to get tested for hiv as thats the one that has him worrying like crazy, he’s not as concerned about the other stds. I should also mention that i haven’t really gotten sick or a fever nor do I show any symptoms of hiv.

The next night when i spoke to my bf i tried asking a bit more about this fear of his and tried educating him on the topic of hiv, after a bit he asked if we could stop talking about this as it freaks him out. He also said that once we get back the results we will never talk about this again. I agreed.

Now im pretty sure this is some kind of phobia my bf has especially since he got tested for hiv  2 years after his first ex with whom he only kissed (she was a virgin too and they never did anything sexual). 

Like i said my boyfriend is a good guy and i love him which is why i agreed to getting tested despite not having a sexual past. Im just wondering if theres anything ethically wrong in this case on his part or I shouldn’t be too concerned."

She does have a very solid reasoning although, the guy before me was more gay than straight, he has since passed, she reached out to the partner he was with before he died and he confirmed that he was infact HIV positive before the passing, he also apologized on the guys behalf for not letting her know in the first place... if that’s the case, how come I tested negative?
