pb2mkd,Does taking PEP act like PreP?,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIV/comments/pb2mkd/does_taking_pep_act_like_prep/,MarquisCasati,1,2021-08-24 20:03:39,1,/r/HIV/comments/pb2mkd/does_taking_pep_act_like_prep/,NaN,"If I've been taking PEP for a few weeks and have unprotected sex with someone who says they are on PreP, is there any risk of me catching HIV even if they somehow lied about taking PreP?
