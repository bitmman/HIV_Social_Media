Usual rant around lurking and not posting much etc. etc. As part of my final year placements, I am starting my placement at a sexual health clinic starting tomorrow. 

I was thinking that it might be educational for me and also possibly good for others if you had any *burning* (sorry..couldn't help myself) questions or concerns that I could ask my supervisor for you since he would be the expert on these issues. 

This, of course, comes with the usual preface and disclaimer that if you have any urgent medical issues, you should see your general medical practitioner or go to the ED instead of relying on the interwebs. So this would be for 'less' urgent things or questions along the lines of ""I've always wondered..."". Also, Australian so there may be differences in terms of medications and protocols used. "

7afxu9,[NSFW] Can we have an in-depth conversation about bottoming/sexual health? Questions inside.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/7afxu9/nsfw_can_we_have_an_indepth_conversation_about/,IamDonatella,124,2017-11-02 17:38:51,38,/r/gaybros/comments/7afxu9/nsfw_can_we_have_an_indepth_conversation_about/,NaN,"Not using a throw away because fuck it. So I just have some questions about bottoming that I don't see mentioned or talked about very often. Figured I'd ask them here :)

- Does anyone else have terrible bowel movements the following days afterwards? I often see people report constipation, but that's never been the case personally. Regardless of using a condom, the type of lube, or no lube at all, the stool is just loose afterwards. Not necessarily diarrhea. It also doesn't matter what I eat. The consistency is still the same. Is this from irritation of the colon? 

- Does anyone else lose all their libido from cleaning themselves out? Even if I do it hours and hours before, all my drive to have sex just flies out the window. It's discouraging, but I feel like I have to clean myself out if I'm going to bottom. 

- I sometimes feel like I subconsciously don't associate anal sex with an actual sexual situation, if that makes sense. It's not that I don't enjoy the experience, but I won't stay hard the entire time (or sometimes just not at all). Is this something that comes with time and experience? After I get really into it, sometimes things will kickstart again, but it's disappointing to bottom and not have that release or 'finalizing' experience. I also feel like I can get really anxious when I anticipate the experience and will just lose the ability to get hard all together :( Does anyone have any experience with this? Tips? Tricks?

- How often can you reasonably clean yourself out? How often do you normally bottom? Do you need a recovery time, and if so, how long is that?

- Are there long term health effects of bottoming?

- Has anyone used female condoms to bottom? Are they more prone to tearing than condoms?

- Any lube recommendations for condoms? Most water based ones I've tried just become so tacky and they feel like they pull on my skin and insides :/

- Does oil or silicone based lube break down polyurethane condoms?

- Is there a way I should be taking care of my butt during downtime? *How do you deal with hemorrhoids?!* Is there anything I can take orally to promote vascular health and ward off hemorrhoids? How often can you use prep H? 

- Just asking for shits and giggs, but is there anything you can do to make your hole cuter? I mean.. at the end of the day, it's a butthole. But still. Ive heard about bleaching. But sometimes you watch porn (I know.. it's porn..) and they almost look like they're hole is not existent! Like it's flush with the rest of their skin tone *and* texture. No wrinkles, no veins, no nothing. Just figured I'd ask, in case anyone has experience here. 

Thank you in advance for all your replies!

7cu0ne,Too many guys risk their partners sexual health by wanting to raw behind their back and I’ve had enough.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/7cu0ne/too_many_guys_risk_their_partners_sexual_health/,DavidUpton91,142,2017-11-13 23:21:27,28,/r/gaybros/comments/7cu0ne/too_many_guys_risk_their_partners_sexual_health/,NaN,As a gay man I have a lot of guys in a relationship with a woman (or man) proposition me to do it “raw.” Without their partner knowing.

Cheating is one thing but risking your partners sexual health so freely and selfishly is actually sociopathic imo.

I just went through it today, cleaned it up a bit, updated a few references (it was originally compiled two years ago), and made it look better. 

If anyone wants to peer review it that would be great.  I wanted to make it accessible somewhere, so if you have ideas on that, that would be great.   

Its focused on Phoenix AZ in terms of consent for minors, and clinics etc.

Input?  Help?   Thanks. :)

If you're interested I can email it to you. "

cwvsqb,I finally took control of my sexual health (and a spook that is “funny” in hindsight).,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/cwvsqb/i_finally_took_control_of_my_sexual_health_and_a/,Percophile,27,2019-08-28 21:07:29,9,/r/gaybros/comments/cwvsqb/i_finally_took_control_of_my_sexual_health_and_a/,Health/Body,"I’m a poorly disciplined and very sexually active young guy living in a city with no shortage of fun opportunities, and I had always been living in the “ignorance is bliss” world of “if I feel fine, I must be fine.”

After a while, the nagging thought that many awful STIs are often asymptomatic for some time and I could be sick without knowing it ate away at me enough to prompt a much needed visit to the clinic.

I ended up being there for 4 hours; they did a blood draw for HIV (and other STIs), a 4th gen rapid HIV test finger prick which returned negative, talked to me about PrEP and set me up with the Gilead application that covers the cost (and Gilead approved it), did the typical examination/swabs, did another blood draw for liver function (they missed the vein this time so I was stabbed 3 times - ugh), gave me 3 vaccines (Hep A, HPV, meningitis - just in case), and sent me off with a 30-day supply of PrEP as well as an appointment at a nearby facility to complete another test next week which will be used to set up the 3-month cycle.

Overall, I consider myself lucky that I had no issues or infections and that I’m on the path toward staying that way.

Now the “funny” part:
Since starting PrEP and taking the initiative, I’ve been more attentive to my body and I took my shirt off today to find a very unsightly bright red splotchy rash on my chest. Cue horror. It vanished completely after 25-30 minutes - I think I’m sensitive to the detergent my laundromat uses and I regularly find a rash after taking my shirt off for the day. Heh eheh.

Moral of the story:
If you have sex with men and you are sexually active, know your status and consider PrEP. Even with all the progressive movement toward de-stigmatizing HIV, I still couldn’t imagine how I would cope with the devastating outcome, and now (after 7 days of being on PrEP) I can be 99% sure that rapid test will be negative every time."

I've been working (my pole) steadily to unravel all of these hangups and removing them to try to get to a full human experience. At the very deepest point I was unable to cum except when watching videos of hot guys' sneakers on YouTube. There couldn't even be anyone in the room. Not even in the damn video. Couldn't even look a boy in the eye, hardly dared to look at their feet. 

Today I shot a wad literally masturbating to the idea of feeling a connection to &amp; having strong feelings for a boy.

And I thought to myself this is the weirdest shit ever nobody will ever fucking believe this if I post it. But I'm willing to elaborate the shit out of it to any non-believers.

I don't know if this is a good thing or actually sad... I just hope that I'm finally nearing the end of my journey towards being able to feel connected to someone and fucking finally cum fucking a boy."

I know that it's very important to know your partner's STI and HIV status. Is it too much to ask them for tangible proof? Like tell them that you either want to go with them to get tested or see the documents. I don't think it is because it shows your honesty and your trying to be cautious. Would you think that your husband or boyfriend doesn't trust you if they said this or would you understand? I'm curious to know your opinions.
