I'm taking the GRE's Sunday. Super nervous. I took them in 2004 to go to grad school and get my masters. Now trying to go back for a PhD. The exam is the last thing in my way of finalizing my applications to two of the top programs in the nation.

1vc7la,Truvada PrEP HIV: Gay men should take pre-exposure prophylaxis.,http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2014/01/06/truvada_prep_hiv_gay_men_should_take_pre_exposure_prophylaxis.html,ghostofpennwast,6,2014-01-15 20:47:10,60,/r/gaybros/comments/1vc7la/truvada_prep_hiv_gay_men_should_take_preexposure/,NaN,
1vqvas,Be careful of the diagnostic code when getting your Truvada PrEP,http://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1vqvas/be_careful_of_the_diagnostic_code_when_getting/,throw5566,22,2014-01-20 23:15:17,55,/r/gaybros/comments/1vqvas/be_careful_of_the_diagnostic_code_when_getting/,NaN,"UPDATE (1/27) my bloodwork all came back OK on the creatine and negative for HIV-1/2 and I received my prescription today for a 30-day supply with six refills. No follow-up office-visit instructions for this. I already see her monthly or so for my lorazepam refills so I suspect she's planning on following up with me on this then.

I dropped the prescription off at my local pharmacy. I explained to the tech I knew there would be a prior authorization required on it. that my physician was expecting it. Also that it was for pre-exposure prophylaxis so there was no hurry, no active infection to worry about. As the tech looked at the script he kinda had a look come over his face of oh, ok, this is someone who knows what's going on with medications and claims, not just someone dropping one off to get filled later. I'm not sure he heard the ""pre-"" part because he said he'd be sure to get started on the processing of it before he left that afternoon (it was about 4 pm when I dropped it off), so I wonder if he thought I was needing it for PEP.

I'll check back with them in a couple of days, or check on their website to see if it's ready or not. Or maybe their ""we'll test you when your prescription is ready"" thing will work for once.

------
Went to my doc today to see about getting on Truvada PrEP. There was some labwork to be done first (HIV test, kidney output, CBC-7). After meeting with her the nurse came back and handed me a lab slip to get the blood an urine workup done. When I got out to my car I looked at the slip. The diagnostic code on the slip was ""V69.2 - high-risk homosexual behavior"". I thought to myself what the hell! I don't sleep around, I play safe always, her and I talked about this with her before she said she would write the prescription assuming the lab work came back on for kidney function and such. I went back to the office and asked the receptionist if I could please speak to the nurse about the code on the slip. The receptionist took it back to the doctor who re-printed it with a more mundane code. The receptionist said the computer had messed up. I'm not sure I believed that, but I thanked her and went to get my lab work done.

Why is this important, or important to me anyway? That diagnostic code is entered into your medical records AND is reported out to your insurance company as the reason the lab work and office visit was done. If your employer self-insures for medical insurance, now your employer has the info. I'm not out banging guys in dark alleys unprotected nightly or at all, I just want an extra level of protection against HIV. Condoms break and people lie.

So when you go to get your Truvada PrEP prescription you might want to talk to you physician as to how they're going to code the lab work and the visit.

1y7hx6,Filled my Truvada PreP prescription today,http://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1y7hx6/filled_my_truvada_prep_prescription_today/,throw5566,27,2014-02-17 19:28:39,92,/r/gaybros/comments/1y7hx6/filled_my_truvada_prep_prescription_today/,NaN,"Wound up having to provide my PCP's office/nurse with an actual internal United HealthCare internal document listing the guidelines for them giving Prior Authorization for Truvada. UHC had initially denied the request stating I didn't have any incidence of HIV infection. My physician was all sorry, nothing I can do your insurance won't cover the drug unless you have HIV. I said yes, I think the guidelines cover it, she was all no I read the papers you provided they don't. I had to go back to my car and get the copy and give it to the nurse to take back in to her (the physician). Then the nurse comes back in the room and goes oh yeah we'll get on this for you. Anyway my first month was filled locally but each month after that for the first six refills will be done via mail-order. The prescribing guidelines say I should have HIV tests every three months, and I think I've read I should have kidney output monitored as well. My PCP didn't indicate any follow-up testing though until it was time for a refill. Cost luckily was only $35. So it's been an effort to even get the prescription and get it filled. I take my first dose in the morning.

EDIT: One week in, no GI irritation, no side effects, I take it every morning with my lansoprazole I was already taking for my GERD so there's not been a problem with how to remember to take a dose either."

I deliberated for a while how I would mark this day. I had a post written out that was largely informative. I scrapped it. I know that the few times I’ve been anxious about the results of an HIV test, the only things that ever eased my nerves were personal connections. 

So instead I thought I would tell you why I take a little blue every day at lunch time. 

For those of you who don’t know what PrEP is, it stands for *pre-exposure prophylaxis*. It is a daily pill that HIV-negative people can take to prevent them from contracting that feared chronic disease. Taken **daily as prescribed**, it reduces the chance of contracting HIV through sexual intercourse by 99%. Taken almost as prescribed (taking it 4-6 times a week) still [reduces risk by over 90%](http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/prevention_prep_factsheet.pdf). It’s like *the pill*, but instead of pregnancy, it’s preventing HIV. 

Needless to say, it’s a game changer. 

I’m 26, I’ve been single for a few years and I’m sexually active. I don’t think any of that is out of the ordinary. I use condoms. Mostly. Prior to this month I would have self-described as safe-only but in reality there were more than a few times when the heat of the moment lead to the start of intercourse that was unprotected. Usually I fixed that. 

There were two incidents in the past several years where I was concerned about the possibility of having contracted HIV. The most recent time was accompanied with an illness a few weeks later and a rash around my armpit that a quick Google suggested could be HIV rash indicative of a recent conversion. Apparently armpit rashes are rare, otherwise. 

I don’t usually worry, but I was admittedly a nervous wreck. Despite the fact that penetrative anal carries a risk of HIV transmission in about 1 out of 900 cases, I was sure I had ran out of luck this time around. I was convinced that I was positive. Being fairly educated on HIV and having some positive friends, I knew that it wasn’t a death sentence. I knew that minus daily pills (I take vitamins daily already, not really a hassle), my lifespan would be unchanged and not much would change from the day to day. I would be monitored more closely by my doctor and wouldn’t be able to give blood, but I could still do all the activities I normally do and be an otherwise perfectly healthy human. With proper treatment, it would *almost* be like it wasn’t there. Or so the research suggests.  But like I said, I’m single. The mental and social stigma was what scared me the most. Maybe that’s shallow or short-sighted, but it’s honestly what frightened me. What mattered to me was that **most people don’t know that [HIV+ people with undetectable viral loads cannot transmit it to their partners.](http://www.hivplusmag.com/treatment/2015/07/23/breakthrough-study-shows-zero-hiv-transmissions-when-undetectable)**

So I went to get tested. It had been a few weeks. In Boston, there is a clinic called [Fenway Health](http://fenwayhealth.org/) that offers free STD screenings without an appointment every Wednesday. Not only is the testing free, but they use advanced 4th-generation blood tests that are 99.9% accurate up to two weeks. They also screen for Hepatitis and Syphilis. The nice thing about Fenway Health is that they are known for their LGBT-focused care, so everything about the visit was designed to make me more comfortable. Their staff was friendly, calm and knowledgeable and I started to think that even if I did come out positive, things would be okay. I understand how lucky I am to live in a city where this resource is available, but [most areas offer free or affordable HIV screening](https://www.aids.gov/hiv-aids-basics/prevention/hiv-testing/hiv-test-locations/) as well. 

A week later I received my results via email. Negative on all fronts. I felt less relieved than I thought I would, to be honest. Instead I felt motivated and empowered to take action to avoid that kind of anxiety again. I had read about PrEP enough on Reddit and other publications to know that I should be on it as a single gay man, but for some reason (nerves? laziness?) I hadn’t asked my doctor about it yet. This incident was all I needed to get off my ass and ask. After all, the CDC and WHO both recommend that all sexually active gay men take this pill. 

After a careful discussion of the side-effects (a small amount of people experience nausea and headaches that usually pass) and implications (very rare reports of kidney or liver problems require that I get blood tests done every 3 months to ensure these do not happen), my doctor wrote me a prescription. I have okay-insurance and it came out to $35 for a 3-month supply. The drug-maker offers a payment assistance program for those who have higher copays that would make it difficult to obtain. 

It’s been a few weeks, and now I take a little blue pill every day at lunch time. It’s really not a bother at all and I haven’t forgotten a dose yet. I’ve experienced no side effects. It's all just... easy. In the few times I’ve had sex since I started taking PrEP I’ve used a condom or avoided anal. I don’t feel a desire to start having a lot of unprotected sex, because I still want to avoid the other STDs (ie: all of them) that PrEP does not protect against. Sure *most* of them have cures, but the daily pill is also a daily reminder to look out for my own health and to take what steps are available to me to prevent problems from occurring. 

Being sexually active is a part of being human. It’s not something we should shame people for. Some people find rewarding relationships and only have sex with that individual once they have committed. Some people don’t find that or don’t want to and have sex with multiple people throughout their lives. What matters, regardless of what shape our sexual lives take, is that we look out for our own health and well being. I won’t tell anyone they *should* get on PrEP, but if you’re sexually active, even if you’re in a relationship, I hope that you  *consider* it. I’m glad I did. "

He ordered an HIV test and everything. So he recommended I called my insurance to see if it's covered. Well I did and it is covered but he said the co-pay is about 60 dollars for a 30 day supply. Seems kinda steep for me considering I'm not getting action every night. Maybe if I had elected for a HSA that would have helped me save some money but it's too late for that this year. So what do you guys think? I'm not exactly drowning in dick right now but recently I had an unexpected sexual encounter and it just makes me think what if next time I'm to drunk or horny to care to use protection. I guess ultimately it's up to me to decide if that's too much money but I'd like to get r/gaybros' opinion. Thanks!"

What is the typical procedure for getting PrEP and how can I start the process?  I already went to a doctor for a prescription and that's how they gave me the $1000 quote.  Some friends suggested my doctor needs to ""authorize"" it, or I can get a card online that subsidizes it. Any suggestions?

Doc said first 8 days or so I might display side effects like dizziness, sleepiness, stomach aches (common) etc. that should clear up.

Not quite sick but not quite right. And its not every day, just most...

I was wondering if anyone else had experienced similar symptoms and if they continued/went away, etc. I've heard some people use supplements to counter the symptoms and was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for things like supps, times of the day to take the pill to avoid the worst of the symptoms, or anything else they know about it.

Worst case scenario, I could always stop taking it if it ceases to go away, but I'm really hoping to find a solution to maintain the course since it's good for my peace of mind and a lot of my friends have been on it for years with few symptoms?

I've been referred to an HIV specialist but have heard nothing back after several months.  My current private health insurance provider (Pacific Blue Cross) says that they *may* cover it if my GP writes a freehand letter explaining why I need it and why the government won't pay for it, and my upcoming new private health insurance provider won't cover it at all (""no prophylaxis coverage"").  I'm Métis, but despite the recent ruling about Métis and non-status Indians being recognised as Indians under the Indian Act ^([God damnit, I hate that term; I'm not from India]), we're still not included as being eligible for benefits under the [Non-Insured Health Benefits Program](http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/health-system-systeme-sante/services/non-insured-health-benefits-services-sante-non-assures/who-eligible-personnes-admissibles-eng.php).

There's still very little information available on getting PrEP, though [GET**PrEP**ED.ca](http://www.getpreped.ca/) will hopefully be a good resource for BC residents, soon; it was suggested to me as a good resource by [HiM](http://checkhimout.ca/), but all that I got from it so far is ""You're still pretty much screwed for now."".  Gilead's co-pay assistance programme [Gilead Advancing Access](https://www.gileadadvancingaccess.com/) is only for people within the USA, and I have yet to find a cheap international online pharmacy.

In summary, despite having been approved for use in Canada, it still nearly seems to be impossible to get — if not by difficulty finding a doctor that knows about it, then by [cost](https://www.canadadrugs.com/products/truvada/200mg-300mg).

Have any of you Canadians had luck in getting access to PrEP?

I think this is great, but what about other STI's?

I have HSV 1, the virus known for causing coldsores...however my initial OB occurred on my ass (damn me for letting my BF rim me). On paper GHSV 1 is not that bad: less contagious than oral coldsores, none to few flareups, most common strain of HSV (50-80% people 18-49) so can't infect those already HSV 1 positive.

However I feel like leper due to this situation, like guys are cool bareback fucking with a POZ guy, but  playing with a guy with GHSV 1 who is honest is to risky. When's the last time you saw a profile where someone disclosed Herpes? Yup, thought so. Everyone is just 100% DDF across the entire gay world...

Just something to think about, I'm not a bad person...but this is my life. I just wanted to vent and get this off my chest."

I just recently got a prescription after mulling it over for a year. I realized that I have a lot of anxiety about sex because I grew up being told that being gay meant I would get HIV and die. That stigma really stuck with me all the time to where even safe sex had me thinking irrational, negative thoughts.

I actually had a hard but rewarding experience. My good friend from volleyball hooked me up with a gay doctor who also can handle my anxiety prescriptions and seems super chill. He was super knowledgeable, made me feel at ease and we have a great and honest discussion about expectations. I gotta admit doing all the bloodwork had me feeling nervous but everything is good.

The cost of PREP on my prescription plan was only 25 per month. As long as I don't have any adverse reactions, I want to follow this through. It keeps me accountable to myself and others and I definitely plan to make sure to be safe but have fun and not take myself too harshly. I also had the added benefit that I got to have a more candid conversation with my roommate about growing up gay."

I have a boyfriend of 4 years, but we've had an open relationship for most of it, and even though we always use condoms with other people (and still will, since other STIs exist) this will help give some peace of mind about what little possibility we have of being infected with HIV from condom mishaps or oral. Hypochondria kinda kills the mood :P

Part of me is a liiiittle nervous since I've never taken a long-term medication before, even though I know the side effects are pretty tame and temporary as your body gets used to the medication. So part of the purpose of this post is to ask what your experiences with it have been, and if you've run into any issues while using it or if it's all been smooth, lubricated sailing. I was also a little nervous about taking it reliably, but apparently missing a dose or two just makes it 95% effective rather than 99% effective, which makes me feel better even though I'm gonna do my best not to forget (but shit happens). I'm just gonna get one of those weekly pill box things, and maybe that will help me remember to actually take fish oil and multivitamins with some regularity too.

Also, they took blood to test for HIV and monitor my liver function and whatnot, but I was able to get the prescription the same day (which I wasn't sure would happen until I went to the pharmacy and it was ready). During my research online, I read that starting PrEP when you're already infected with HIV has a small chance of causing you to develop drug resistance ([see this page](https://men.prepfacts.org/the-questions/) under ""What about the chance of HIV developing drug resistance to Truvada for PrEP?""). I have no reason to suspect that I would have contracted HIV or have abnormal liver function since the last time I got tested a few months ago, but I HAVE been sexually active with a few people since then (again, all safe sex or oral), so do I need to wait until my test results come in negative before I start taking it just in case? She didn't seem worried, but I'd like to cover all my bases if I can help it.

I'm wondering if anyone else has had this side effect for several weeks straight, and if it ended up resolving on its own because it's starting to worry me a bit. I seem to go to the bathroom at least twice a day on most days. Very few days have I had gone just once. 

An accompanying persistent side effect has also been a lot of gas, but then again, I do eat a lot of fiber, which you'd think would help counteract the diarrhea, but nope! Only other noticeable symptom I've had was stomach cramping/pain, but that hasn't been as much of an issue nor as persistent. 

I have a hiking trip this Saturday, and umm... I will make sure to bring some extra toilet paper. lol"

* I have to buy my insurance through the market place. 
* Though nearly all plans cover PrEP, only one has a flat fee for name brand drugs with a premium of $550/mo. 
* All other plans make you pay all out of pocket until you hit your deductible, and after you hit the deductible, it's $600 a month (30% of ~$2000) for the meds.
* Gilead offers $7,900 (the out of pocket max) on it's coupon card for 2019.

Does anyone know if Blue Cross Blue Shield (perhaps specifically BCBS-TX) allows for the Gilead card to be applied to:

1. The deductible; and/or
2. The out of pocket maximum?  

If the Gilead card does not apply to the deductible and/or the out of pocket max, have any of you come across other ways to get PrEP without forking over a ton of money?

Any help is appreciated!

TL;DR - Does Gilead Coupon Card count towards deductibles for blue cross (of texas) plans?"

Just wanted to share my experience so that maybe others going through a similar situation in the future can use it for some good.

I've been on PrEP for about 2 years. I've had to explain to a couple of different medical professionals over the years what it is and why I need it. This is my most recent experience doing this.

I had to go to the hospital on Halloween. I thought I was having really bad gas/constipation and it was super painful. Turned out I had appendicitis and needed to break up with my appendix (one of my longest relationships ever). So I stayed in the hospital overnight for my surgery.

The next morning, right before my surgery, a nurse is going through some standard medical questions that you are usually asked before surgery. When she's done she asks me, pretty loudly, to confirm I was HIV positive.

At first I freaked out since as far as I knew I wasn't HIV+. I told her I was not aware of that and asked her if I tested positive while I was at the hospital. Eventually she admits that she thought I was positive since I was on Truvada. I explain to her that I was taking it to prevent HIV and that it's kind of like the pill but for gay guys. I think she was kind of embarrassed, but since this wasn't the first time I had to explain this stuff to a doctor or nurse I told her not to feel that bad and a lot of people make the same mistake. A couple of the other nurses there were also not familiar with PrEP.

Sorry if this got kind of rambly! I'm still on pain killers from my appendectomy. Hope my sharing this experience can help other people going through difficult times."

So the only medication I take is Truvada (mornings) and fiber supplements (mornings and evenings). I never thought twice about taking them together in the mornings, but the guy that I'm seeing mentioned that the fiber supplements can decrease the absorbency of the Truvada.

Is there truth to this? I really don't want to have to keep my fiber supplements in my car and take them at work, but I'd much rather have my PreP work!"

I'm also writing from mobile, so apologies for formatting errors.

I had been weighing up taking PrEP or not for about a week before I started it a week ago. Everything was relatively smooth sailing before today.

I take my pill like every other day, at 11am. Nothing's wrong, and I go about my day. Come 9pm, I suddenly feel cold. Really cold. Shivering so much I can't read text messages cold. I jump into bed with blankets and a dressing gown on over my clothes, and I'm still freezing.

I start to panic a little, but then a lot more once the abdominal pain starts. Absolute agony - I felt like my intestines had been tied in a horribly tight knot. I felt sick and almost threw up a couple times. This stayed with me as I started to shake less and feel warmer, for a long while and up until the headache started. Doing anything felt like a gong going off inside my head.

My panic now is making the symptoms worse and I Google the problem. What do I find? You might have liver failure.

Shit.

Luckily I waited before calling the hospital because relatively soon afterwards everything seemed to die down, but this was 2 hours after the shivers started.

I'm now in bed, feeling a little too warm, with a light headache and a newfound rejection of PrEP. No more for me thanks."

I asked him if the Vitamin D in my diet is enough, he said no. I asked him if there’s a certain concentration of the Vitamin I need to take, he said whatever’s available at your local drugstore. I asked if there’s any way I can compensate without the supplement, he said more sun exposure but it’s usually not enough.
This is the first time I have ever heard of people on PrEP needing to take Vitamin D in conjunction and I find some of his answers to my questions curious. I’m not against taking it if I need to, I just find it odd especially since the efficacy of vitamins and supplements are somewhat contested."

Backstory:

* I recently had unprotected sexual intercourse and was concerned about potentially being diagnosed with HIV.
* Many doctors seemed judgmental, but claimed they didn't really know enough about Truvada (medication to treat HIV) to prescribe it. The Urgent Care wouldn't even take me in, so I had to go to the Emergency Room.

&amp;#x200B;

Important Part:

Anyways, I went to the pharmacy and was told that AFTER insurance, it would've cost around $250 for Truvada and around $250 for Timicay for only 15 days worth of tablets. ($500 every two weeks = $13,000 per year!!)

I just wanted to let everyone know that Gilead (maker of Truvada and Timicay) has a coupon program where they will generally cover the copay (what regular insurance doesn't cover). There's no monthly limit and you shouldn't be able to hit the yearly limit unless your insurance doesn't cover enough.

**Bottom line: I was able to pay $0 for HIV meds. If you have HIV and are prescribed Truvada or Timicay, you can go to** [www.gileadadvancingaccess.com](https://www.gileadadvancingaccess.com) **to see if you're eligible for help!**

They have programs for people with or without insurance. Not sure about the non-insurance option since I have health insurance. They don't cover government health plans since usually the government provides almost all of the coverage itself.

Disclosure: I take full responsibility for my actions. It was just unfortunate that regular doctors wouldn't prescribe the meds for me. Also, I get nothing for providing the link. Just trying to be helpful. :) You can look it up on a search engine if you prefer (rather than clicking the link).

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: If this isn't allowed, please let me know. I just didn't want anyone to pay more than they have to if they're in a similar situation."

As the title says, I started PrEP 3 months ago and it's really sexually liberated me. Maybe too much. I've been to 4 sex parties since then, one of them in Berlin (almost nobody there uses condoms). I also started getting comfortable with the idea of fucking bb, thinking you can get all other STDs with just oral too (and let's face it, nobody's using condoms for oral), so why bother having anal with condoms. Honestly, the fact is it just feels much better without (I'm mostly a bottom btw).

Well, I cought gonnorhea, about month and a half ago, and chlamydia, just now. And actually the strain of chlamydia I caught (the worst one, LGV), is almost always transfered by bb. Also other STDs, it's true you can get them from oral, but the likelihood is just much higher from bb anal, especially if you bottom.

So yeah, ask me anything I guess. From now on, I'll try to consistently use condoms."

A little info about me, I am terrified of STDs, HIV primarily as I am sure we all are. For a long time, I’m talking a couple years, i abstained from anal sex because of my crippling fear. STD testing has always been a traumatic experience, and once I got gonorrhea from someone who said they were clean. 

Anyway, fast forward, I felt like I was letting my youth pass me by without enjoying sex, and so I go std tested before I had sex and told people I was negative since it had been a couple years. Everything came out negative, and so I started having sex again. With a condom of course, and I met a guy who I really like, we have great sex, good chemistry, and he is on prep and works at a hospital.

He is respectful and we used condoms though he still said I should get on prep anyway. The last time we had sex was without a condom, my first time ever without a condom, in my mind because I trust he is responsible and takes it seriously. It was amazing, it DID feel better. The next day I freaked out tho and went to get tested again, two months after the previous time, and everything came out negative fortunately (I know it wouldn’t detect anything from that last sex though) although I literally had extreme nervous breakdowns waiting for the HIV results which they took extra days to post. I was convinced it would be bad news and it was just so incredibly traumatic. Even though the other times have been with a condom, I still have crippling anxiety over it.

ANYWAY, so a week after getting tested at another clinic, I went to my hospital where I have insurance to get tested AGAIN so that I can get on prep, so that we can have no condom sex and me have greater peace of mind. I am not planning on having sex with other hookups or randoms without a condom. Only him. I have been reading about it here on reddit and I am incredibly confused about prep though.

At the clinic I usually get tested, they’ve told me you CAN NOT get HIV if you’re on prep, and someone who is in prep CAN NOT pass it on. They said drinking doesn’t matter while I’m on it because it gets filtered through the kidneys.

I am a heavy drinker, which I know in and of itself is very bad and I have to work on that. But I know myself and I love the drink and sex is not worth being sober by a long shot.

On reddit, I’ve read it fucks up your liver and that you can get bad side effects if you drink. 

At my hospital they check your liver and kidneys every 3 months, but at the clinic they only check your kidneys once every 6 months.

Also, I’ve read that it leads to ARV resistant hiv? I’m confused. 

When I first heard of prep about 5 years ago, it seemed too good to be true and I did hear a lot of talk about side effects and just thought it prompted reckless sex which is why I never considered it until now with this guy.

Sorry this is probably a jumbled post and I will ask my doctor about this but I am just so damn confused."

I started taking PrEP on Friday for the first time, and on about the 3rd day I noticed the roof of my mouth felt kind of numb, and this hard persisted as of today (day 6).

Has anyone experienced this? I don’t know if I should keep taking it and wait another week, or if I should be worried that this is something bad? I’m really bummed because it took me years to get the courage to learn about PrEP and go on it, and I thought I’d finally have something to help me with the extreme anxiety I deal with after sex and sti testing... and maybe that isn’t the case afterall.

There seems to be some confusion recently on reddit and in the media about the availability of PrEP medications and their coverage in the United States. Things are changing and have changed. Regardless of your views on the future of healthcare in the us, gay men currently have many options for obtaining HIV prevention and wellness access. 

**1**: If you meet the requirements for the USPSTF [recommendation](https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prevention-of-human-immunodeficiency-virus-hiv-infection-pre-exposure-prophylaxis) for PrEP it is covered as preventative care with no cost sharing per the ACA (see [pdf](https://docdro.id/47OoBnu)). Your compliant ACA insurance plan CANNOT charge you anything for PrEP if you meet the requirements of the recommendation. This means no out of pocket costs, both for testing and medications. Talk with your health care provider (first) and insurer if this isn't the case, they should be complying based on your risk profile. 

**2**: Descovy by Gilead isn't the best thing since sliced bread. You should be discussing with your healthcare provider the difference between Descovy and Truvada (also by Gilead) and which is right for you. They have different side-effects and different efficacy profiles. Don't believe anyone on the internet that says objectively one is better than the other, do your own research on submissions to the FDA and independent research. They have differences and you should talk to a medical professional (doctor or pharmacist) not your gay buddy or sex partners to understand the difference. Don't switch just because it's new and exciting, it's not a good look, for any of us. 

**3**: New options are on their way. Teva is releasing a generic for Truvada to the United States market. In the case that Descovy or Truvada are too expensive and you do not fit into the high-risk recommendation, generics for Truvada have been available for years (mainly for Cipla). If you have difficulty with the co-pay [program](https://www.gileadadvancingaccess.com/?utm_source=TruvadaPREP_DTC&amp;utm_medium=referral) by Gilead, one can order through (reputable) online pharmacies, usually with simply a prescription (sometimes not enforced) from a primary care provider. You can get three month quantities in the $200-300 range. 

There are additional programs through Medicaid, state, and country programs that one may qualify. Find your local county medical clinic or STI testing resources. The best tool that we can have is being educated about our options. Make sure you're advocating for safer sex practices, knowing status and keeping up with general health for yourself and your sexual partners. PrEP is only one aspect of sexual and physical wellness. Be safe, supportive, and get educated."

HIV+ patients have stopped using Truvada *years* ago, they now use Descovy (as part of the cocktail). It's now been approved for HIV-negative people as PrEP.

There's no downside to switching to Descovy, but you have to ask most of the time, before your doctor switches you to it. And you may have to call your insurance company.

If you're not on PrEP yet, ask for Descovy over Truvada."

I saw the letter and didn't think too much about  it.

Today, I went to go pick up the prescription and the pharmacist told me that my insurance didn't cover Truvada anymore (that I knew) and my out of pocket cost today was going to be around ~$150. I previous didn't pay anything with my insurance and the [Gilead Copay Card](https://www.gileadadvancingaccess.com/copay-coupon-card) but since the generic PrEP is made by Teva, the copay card didn't apply. Asked the pharmacist what the normal price for the Teva version was and it was apparently around $1700 compared to the $1900 (if I recall) for Gilead version so like not even that much cheaper. 

I didn't really wanna pay $150 but also knew that I should have the medication. I looked online to see if there was a copay card for the Teva version like the Gilead version. It wasn't direct based on the Google searches but I [found it](https://www.tevahivgenerics.com/truvada-generic). Brought my out of pocket costs down again to $0.

TL;DR: US healthcare expensive. If your insurance no longer covers Gilead version of Truvada and only does the generic version (Teva is the only manufacture right now), you can still get a [copay card from Teva](https://www.tevahivgenerics.com/truvada-generic) and reduce your out of pocket costs."

So I recently went to the doctor to start looking into starting PrEP I am currently a 25 year old male, who is still on my parents insurance. I would prefer them not to know I was on this medication. Still not fully accepting of me being gay, and have a lot of stigma towards the topic as a whole but they are progressing a lot faster than anticipated. 

Anyway I went to the doctor about a month ago to get bloodwork done to start PrEP. Everything came back great except I then came to the realization that my insurance plan does not cover STD testing; which means I had to pay out of pocket for my tests. I was fortunately able to afford it, but it was a burden I prefer not to bare. 

So over the weekend I ended up having a drunk hook up with a friend of mine. I topped, however he played with my bum a bit and accidentally cut me with his finger nail. The only reason I knew this was because I had to pee and wiped what I presume was lube turned out to be blood, he had none on him. I immediately washed it out and cleaned it up and it stopped bleeding super quickly. I let him know, that play stopped and immediately I asked him my conscious kicked in and I asked him about his status on things. He told me he was on PrEP(which I had known before hand), and had no STDs from his last visit (a month before). And we continued on until we both got tired and neither of us came.  

So from the financial aspect this makes me super skeptical to start prep, or even go to the doctor again as I’m not sure my insurance would even cover it. However given that this little situation could have turned for the worse, does anyone have any experiences in getting started/ the medication?"

I just wanted to share how I found a great PreP program without insurance.  I never really looked into the medication before since I always was safe and pretty selective with partners. But I recently started dating a great guy who is HIV+ (great health, undetectable), and I thought it'd be smart to start taking it.

I looked into a bunch of PreP companies (like Nurx) and compared plans. I don't have insurance since I was laid off due to Covid. Every program was going to end up costing me hundreds per month just for fees etc. 

Then I had the brilliant idea just to google programs in my city/state. I live in Utah and wasn't expecting much. Utah isn't the most gung-ho when it comes to LGBTQ+ things (except Salt Lake City).  I actually found a PreP program that covers everything--tests, medication, provider appointments--through the University of Utah! It was a Montero-send (gay version of godsend). Been on Descovy ever since. I could even choose Truvada if I wanted in the program.

So if you're looking for prep and don't have insurance, try to look for local programs near you. You'd be surprised! Much love!"

* don't do extreme sports or activities and rarely need a doctor (broke a toe 2 years ago and nothing else for 5+ years)
* a high deductible plan would save me over $900/year in healthcare contributions (my employer pays the rest)

I am on PreP and take labs every 3 months per doctor's orders. My copay is $10/month (maybe it's $5?) for Descovy and lab is $10 co-pay.

I've tried to read the Plan Summary for the Anthem 2800 HDP and it's confusing. I don't understand if labs are part of the co-pay or labs are out of pocket up to my deductible (I think it's the latter). 

I've had safe sex twice since December and don't really know if it's worth staying with Kaiser.... I'm paying for the peace of mind, but also paying all this for something that I feel I don't really need. I'm torn. I don't know how much STD testing would cost out of pocket, but can't image it's more than $900/year (the money I'd save by switching from Kaiser to Anthem's HDHP).

I did my own research and wanted to share with you. THIS IS NOT MEDICAL ADVICE, but merely a summary of information available on the internet, mainly from the CDC.

HIV diagnosis is in decline[https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/msm/index.html ]. 

""From 2014 to 2018, HIV diagnoses decreased 7% among gay and bisexual men overall.""

The paragraph below, from the same CDC page I added above, equates using condom to prevation (PrEP) or treatment medication. Notice it says OR, not AND. The capitalization in the sentence below is mine. 

""Some factors put gay and bisexual men at higher risk for HIV, including having anal sex with someone who has HIV without using protection (like condoms OR medicine to prevent or treat HIV). Anal sex is the riskiest type of sex for getting or transmitting HIV. Receptive anal sex is 13 times as risky for getting HIV as insertive anal sex.""

How effective is PrEP against HIV infection?

""PrEP reduces the risk of getting HIV from sex by about 99% when taken as prescribed[https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/prep/prep-effectiveness.html ]"". 

And how effective are condoms against HIV?

""Epidemiologic studies that are conducted in real-life settings, where one partner is infected with HIV and the other partner is not, demonstrate that the consistent use of latex condoms provides a high degree of protection[https://www.cdc.gov/condomeffectiveness/latex.html#HIV ].""

Another source indicates about 90-95% effective:

""A reexamination of HIV seroconversion studies suggests that condoms are 90 to 95% effective when used consistently, i.e. consistent condom users are 10 to 20 times less likely to become infected when exposed to the virus than are inconsistent or non-users[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9141163/ ].""

It is true that condoms prevent other STDs besides HIV. But regarding specifically to HPV, the CDC website says:

""Use latex condoms the right way every time you have sex. This can lower your chances of getting HPV. But HPV can infect areas not covered by a condom – so condoms may not fully protect against getting HPV[https://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/stdfact-hpv.htm ].""

Bottom line (this is my opinion): looking at the information above there is no reason to believe that someone who takes PrEP as recommended is at a higher risk of getting an HIV infection compared to the same person were wearing condoms instead.

But keep in mind that there are other STIs PrEP will not protect you against: Gonorrhea, Syphilis, Chlamydia, etc.

Condoms may not prevent you from getting HPV. 

I hope this helps you to make an informed decision regarding how you can protect yourself and other from STDs, especially HIV.

I'm going to be extremely blunt: I'm a total top, and a major appeal of PreP, to me, is the ability to go bare and not catch HIV. Yes, I understand that PreP doesn't protect you from other STI's, crabs, God's Wrath, etc., but those aren't really my major concern. 

Previously, I've consistently used condoms 99% of the time, only going bare in moments of personal weakness or when I thought I was in love, and always feeling guilty about it afterwards. I hate condoms and how they feel. I want to be basically done with them.

If you are on PreP, and this describes you somewhat, how do you go about choosing who to go bare with?

Do you go bare with everybody? Every hookup? Or nobody? Or just people you ""know"", or some other mental algorithm you have for balancing the risk with the reward?

Please, no judgment. I know I can't be the only one who is wondering about this.

So today I finally went and got a prescription for PrEP, after meaning to get on it for a while I never took the initiative because I was rarely hooking up (and things were pretty locked down for a while). But now that I have it I feel these unexpected nerves about taking it. I'm not sure if it's just that I've never been on a long-term medication, or I am worried about the side effects. There is a lot going on in my life that might be influencing all this (I even almost passed out during blood work today, first time I've ever experienced that). The clinic I went to was very helpful and even has a PrEP team to ask questions to and everything. 

Can anyone share their experiences with it? Maybe hearing people's perspectives or how their bodies reacted to getting on it would be helpful! I think talking about this would help ease some of my nerves. Thanks!"

My husband has a prescription for Truvada and Descovy. He doesn’t know I know. I haven not yet asked him about it. 

So far as I know, he doesn’t have sex with other people. 

So, are there medial reasons one would take this medication other than questionable sexual encounters? 

I’m totally fine with research about side effects, or whatever drug trial related nonsense might be going on before jumping to the sex talk. 

I don’t even care if he is doing the sex with other people, I just want to know."

I want to get prep but it’s going to cost me loads to get it through the doctors, does anyone know of any reputable websites that I can get prep online ?"
