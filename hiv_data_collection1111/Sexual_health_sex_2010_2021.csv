dzsxi,I wrote this blog article for my Sexual Health class on Squirting and thought I'd share it with my source of inspiration :),https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/dzsxi/i_wrote_this_blog_article_for_my_sexual_health/,djizzzzzle,4,2010-11-01 18:34:45,6,/r/sex/comments/dzsxi/i_wrote_this_blog_article_for_my_sexual_health/,NaN,"The social forum site known as “Reddit”, has a subsection dedicated to sex, where people can share stories, share articles, and ask questions. As an avid follower, I have noticed a question of female ejaculation always appears at least three times a week. Many women and their partners are often baffled by the amount of liquid that is released from female ejaculation. Common questions are “Oh no! Did I pee all over my partner and the bed?!” or “I have never done that before, it was awesome, but is it normal?!”  This sensation, also known as “squirting”, is the expulsion of great amounts of clear or milky fluid. The true makeup and root cause of this liquid substance is still in question.  However, researchers believe squirting is caused by continual G-spot stimulation or intense vulval stimulation. Squirting is normal, and happens to at least 40% of women.  

This fluid comes from the paraurethral ducts through and around the urethra, during or before an orgasm. Many women state they feel a sensation of having to pee before they squirt. Analysis of the ejaculate shows that it contains sugars and proteins found in male ejaculation, making the Skene’s glands most likely to be responsible for the fluid. Because the Skene’s gland size varies among different women, it helps explain why stimulation can cause some women to ejaculate and others to not. 

Just because a woman can squirt does not make her a better sex partner, but it does not make her any less of a sex partner either. Female ejaculation is something some women can experience once in their life, or even multiple times. If you are a squirter, do not fear when floods of ejaculate rush outside of your vagina. If the mess bothers you or makes you self conscious, you can always have a towel to ensure an easy clean up!

About two weeks ago (June 13th) we began having sex--the first few times we used a condom but he was having a hell of a time maintaining an erection with one on and we've been having unprotected sex since then (I've religiously taken BC pills ever since I became sexually active and have never had a legit pregnancy scare, so I'm not too concerned about that. That's a non-issue here.).

Exactly a week later, I began to experience this extreme itching around my labia majora/perineum/anus. I was also on my period, so it really just sucked to be my genitals. I thought it was because I had shaved pretty much everything down there the week before and it was all miserable and itchy because the hair was growing back.

The extremely-miserable-itching has since stopped, but there's now little bumps in those aforementioned areas. They're slightly more red than my skin down there already is and a little sore to the touch--this might be from the scratching I'd been doing and the (occasionally pretty rough) sex I've been having most nights. Maybe they're been there my whole life or something and I've just now noticed them, I have no idea.

ANYWAY I'M NOW TERRIFIED THAT I HAVE HERPES AND DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. Obviously I'm now going to get tested (trying to make an appointment tomorrow for next week), but I feel like I need to talk to my partner as well. I've only had 3 other sexual partners and used condoms consistently with all but one of them, that one being a 3+ relationship in which we both lost our virginity to each other. My new partner is five years older than me and I have literally no idea how sexually experienced he is. I was once drunkenly warned by the ex-boyfriend of a girl I'm friends with to be careful about being with this guy because he once hooked up with his ex (my friend) and she's ""slutty"", which I guess might suggest she possibly gave my new boyfriend something. I feel like my boyfriend would have *said* something potentially-having-an-STD, though...he's definitely not some kind of scumbag and we both said, after the first condomless-sexual-encounter, that we're both clean to our knowledge. Maybe I'm incredibly naive but I don't think this guy would purposefully lie to me--two of my good friends set me up with him, our relationship doesn't consist of just having sex, everything is not shitty, etc.  AUUUUGH.

I'm pretty anxious and upset right now for a bunch of reasons.

* I think I might possibly have genital herpes. I might not. 
* There's anxiety in general over me being relatively sexually inexperienced and not knowing what the deal with my new boyfriend is.
* I feel like I should address both of these concerns with him but have no clue as to how to do that because it's uncomfortable and embarrassing and we've been dating for less than a month. Like, what if he doesn't have herpes and I ask him about all this before getting tested and then things get suddenly very awkward.


Sorry if this post is annoyingly whiney and poorly written and I'm just being overly concerned. I just need some general advice/help."

kdf0k,Dear ladies of r/sex:  Your sexual health is important.  Please don't avoid going to a doctor because you are scared of what people (including your family) will think.,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/kdf0k/dear_ladies_of_rsex_your_sexual_health_is/,[deleted],66,2011-09-12 13:08:13,12,/r/sex/comments/kdf0k/dear_ladies_of_rsex_your_sexual_health_is/,NaN,"It doesn't happen often, but it does happen.  Women avoid going to the Ob/Gyn because they don't want to have a discussion with their family or worry about an insurance claim that suggests that they are being sexually active.  Or, they avoid going to the doctor out of embarassment or because of money issues.  Please, for the love of god, stop doing this.

Here are places you can go if you don't have an established Ob/Gyn:

1.  Try your student health center.  Almost all general exams including pap smears can be done here.  If you end up needing a specialist, they will refer you out.

2.  Try Planned Parenthood.  They often see patients on a sliding scale based upon income.

3.  Call a regular General Practitioner.  Yes, a normal family doctor can do a pap smear and a pelvic exam and can treat you for minor issues.  They're not the *best* place to get one, obviously a specialist is ideal, but if you are in a pinch, you can still get an exam here.  Same deal with Urgent Care (but usually slightly more expensive).

4.  Contact your local health department (either city or state) and see if they have health clinics.  Usually these have a longer wait for appointments, but they also offer reduced or sliding scale fees.

If you are insured through your parents and are afraid of what they might think if they see a claim for an OB/Gyn, you can *call your insurance company* and talk to them about where they send the EOB (Explanation of Benefits).  The EOB is a short document that summarizes that you saw a physician (but not what for); it may mention if a pathology exam or some other blood test was done, and it will explain the billing/co-pay/what they settled with the physician for.  It does NOT contain any other information about your appointment.  It will never disclose what you discussed with your doctor or any other notes.  Here is an [example of what one looks like](https://www.excellusbcbs.com/wps/wcm/connect/2645ee004e8ea55fa417bfe420b83c88/eob_explanation.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CACHEID=2645ee004e8ea55fa417bfe420b83c88).  **The insurance company is required by law (via HIPPA) to protect your privacy**.  You can request that the EOB be sent to you, or a different address.  

If none of these are an option for you, you can still make an appointment with a specialist and when you indicate that you are self-pay, ask about paying the ""allowed amount"" that insurance companies normally reimburse for an exam.  The price difference here can be ~50% less than the billed amount.

Please do NOT let fear or embarassment be barriers to being your own advocate for health.  "

I'm in an LDR and when I see my SO in two weeks it will have been 6 weeks since we last saw each other.

This story starts with a drunken encounter with a friend I had been attracted to, which leads to sex (protected, but also my first experience), to eventual dating, to a break-up. However, after that break-up, I discovered that my partner was HIV-positive. Yes, we always used protection, but my problem is that I specifically asked him before our first encounter whether or not he was clean, to which he replied 'yes.' I again questioned him, when we were hanging out one day and he had left some of his medication out, but he again continued to insist that he was clean, and that there was nothing to tell me.

After the break-up, I googled the name of the medication out of general curiosity, and found it was one used to treat HIV. A bit more snooping ~~and call me paranoid all you like~~ led to finding out he had a profile on an HIV-positive dating website. When I point-blank asked him about it, this is the rundown he gave me.

His father cheated on his mother, and then got his mother pregnant with him, also infecting her with HIV, so he was born positive. It's been managed for quite some time, but apparently he very rarely tells his partners about it while they're dating. His reasoning for this is because he 'takes care of himself, and if he was to go and get a test that very day, it would come out negative, that's how low the count of the virus in his bloodstream is.' When I asked him if he would have told me, he indicated that he would have most likely told me a few months after the break-up. Up until recently, he didn't disclose his status, because he didn't want to be treated differently, and simply felt it ""wasn't important.""

I've been lucky enough to have tested clean thus far, but what is Reddit's opinion on how he went about this situation?"
t2frz,AskSexxit: How do you get over sexual behavior that implies risks to your health?,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/t2frz/asksexxit_how_do_you_get_over_sexual_behavior/,confessions_,3,2012-05-01 17:37:59,6,/r/sex/comments/t2frz/asksexxit_how_do_you_get_over_sexual_behavior/,NaN,"OK, this is pretty simple. I have a cum fetish. It's my ultimate fantasy, it's what I like the most. I love giving oral sex to men, and I love when they finish inside me. That alone is dangerous. Even the oral sex alone. You can get HIV and herpes and genital warts and whatnot from it.

I'm HIV positive already. That means I have to be a little more careful with sex, both for me and my partners.

I don't usually pursue sex much. I'm single at the time, and I don't sleep around. EXCEPT when I'm really horny. Then I'll do it with whomever I can get. That pretty much means I have pretty low standards, at that point. I'll do it once, and that's it. This happens every couple of months. I completely lose control. I'll get a little drunk without even noticing it (a couple of drinks are enough apparently) and go on ""autopilot mode"". I can't help myself.

I like sex, I love it, and having a good, open sexuality is something important for me. In a point in my mind, I think I'd like to live my sexual fantasies to the fullest and explore as much as possible. I'm starting to wonder whether this sexual fantasy is sick (since it carries risks I'm not comfortable with) and me pursuing it repeatedly, uncontrollably, means my views on sexuality, sexual desires and fantasies are essentially wrong. I also wonder if what I pursue is the risk, the Russian roulette side of it. What makes me ignore the risks when I'm horny?

Should I decide to stop? That's awfully difficult, I pretty much know I can't control it. How do I do it? I've tried for years to stop it but I can't get myself to do it. I'll trick myself eventually and end up in the same place again. Maybe I should have more sex, safe sex, even safe oral sex. For the record I'd feel ridiculous asking for protection while sucking cock. Maybe I need to explore more submissive sex, maybe that way I'll get a different thrill that'll replace the cum dumpster one?

I hate that about myself. I hate that something that implies so much risk for my health excites me and turns me on. 

Can you relate with this? Have you had reproachable sexual behavior? How did you get over it, or if you didn't, how do you live with it? What am I doing wrong??

TL;DR: I'm basically a cum whore and can't get over it. I feel guilty because it represents risks to my health. What do I do?"

I find it incredibly helpful for facilitating the conversation about disclosure and making sure you don't forget any important details. Also, if someone is uncomfortable with this level of sharing, it's a good way to avoid doing anything risky with someone who doesn't take communication about safe sex sufficiently seriously.

The one I use is modified somewhat--I write in different things for giving vs receiving, and I gray the text on the partners section for partners that are long enough prior to my last testing date that the tests shouldn't have missed something due to an infection having not quite fully progressed at time of testing.

I've a few questions to ask, some that are pretty unnerving for me so here goes

I've been with this girl for about 2 months, we've stupidly had sex numerous times without a condom, and she's not on birthcontrol, recipe for disaster, yes, and I'm an idiot for doing so.

However, she's told me that she's had an 'irritation' in her vagina. 

It doesn't look diseased, doesn't smell bad, but apparently its irritated sometimes and has discharge.

She didn't tell me until after we've done it unprotected. 

Over a little bit of time, i've kind of forgotten about it and today she's said that she's had more discharge, and pain in her uterus / Bladder area, she's already had her period at the beginning of the month.

Question one- Is it possible that she may be pregnant? I've been very careful and have pulled out way before ejaculating. 

Issue number 2. While she was out of the house today I got bored and masturbated. I couldn't really get erect which is weird because I normally have no problems doing so. But after a while I was, and when I came, I came blood, and now I just kind of hurt. 

It wasn't a lot of blood, it was just half blood and half ejaculate. 


-Sorry if that's gross-

But basically question 2 is - What are some possible things that are happening to me? I haven't suffered any trauma recently, and everything has been ok down there.

Besides the sperm jellies..

Maybe I'm just dieing. I'm going to an after hours clinic tomorrow and hopefully she'll come along too."

I know there's meant to be some spotting but it was enough for me to use a pad for the bleeding. Luckily, the next day it was fine again so I figured it was pretty normal and thought nothing of it.

We had sex again after a week or so and it went successfully though he didn't go all the way in (he didn't the first time either - he's very big and it hurt a lot) but then the third time he unintentionally got carried away and went in much deeper and there was a LOT of bleeding. 

I decided to wait until the end of the next day before going to the doctor and by then it had just about stopped but now I'm too afraid to have sex again and I'm wondering if it's natural to bleed like that, taking into account the fact that he's he's very, very big and it was my first time.

I know that I should get a check-up, because it wouldn't hurt anyway and it's important to be 100% sure that everything is okay down there but I'm currently away somewhere where I can't get one so I need to know if I should be worried and dealing with it ASAP, or if it is just a normal side-effect.

Any advice would be absolutely amazing!

I have a few questions, I really appreciate anyone who can answer them, and sources are always appreciated. I have never had someone talk to me about sex ed, and have heard all kinds of stuff so I don't really know what to think. Some of my questions involve escorts; I am not looking for a debate on morality but would rather learn about sexual health facts. Thank you!

I have a fear of STDs and STIs, and I am completely unsure if they are rational or not. I have heard some people say that the amount of people who have STDs or STIs and the transmition rates are blown far out of proportion by the medical industry. I have heard others say that 8/10 people have one. I am not sure what to think as to how prevalent they are. Is it worth not ever having sex again due to fear of STDs and STIs? Is it very difficult living with STDs and STIs?

I have seen many normal women have group sex with my friends and never use condoms. Most of my friends have never used condoms in their relationships, let alone one night stands (or orgies). On the flipside, I've heard that higher end escorts always use condoms. Is it really more dangerous to be with a high end escort than to be with normal/the average woman?

I have a fetish for thai shemales. Are the transmission rates much higher for male - trans sex than male - female sex?

I am a hermit and most likely will only sleep with escorts/prostitutes in the future. If I use condoms for all sex (including oral), do I have a high chance of living a relatively clean life? What about if I only recieve oral from escorts (with a condom) but no penetration?"

Well, I've been taking them for about a week now, at the recommended dosage, and one thing that my wife and I have both noticed is that my libido is way up. Not only is sex on my mind more often than normal (and that's saying something!), I'm also getting more and stronger erections during the day (not always a good thing) and able to recover quicker, even desire more sex shortly after orgasmic. 

Well I researched the herbal ingredients in the supplement last night, and sure enough, a few of them were thought to increase libido. (If I remember, I'll try to edit this with the list of ingredients when I get home. I cannot remember it all or which ingredient did what) 

This got me thinking. So many of the questions on this subreddit deal with libido mismatches, and while some people think to ask about changing prescription meds known to lower libido or whether a guy has low T or something like that, I don't think I've seen anybody suggest an herbal approach to improving libido. 

I mean, I know that herbal supplements, etc, aren't necessarily a magical cure-all, and I certainly hope nobody thinks they are, but it may be worth exploring as an option for improving sexual health. While my experience is anecdotal, and it may not necessarily be that these pills are the cause of my sudden and unexpected rise in libido (though I can't imagine what else it could be), I have to imagine that there's no harm in suggesting people give some of these herbal remedies a try, too.

What is there to lose? If it doesn't work, they're short a few bucks and back where they started. If it does, then everybody's happy. 

So what's you folks' opinions on the matter?"

My partner [M/27] and I [F/24] have started having sex recently and, as we have both been to the sexual health clinic and been given the all clear, and I am on long term contraception (the Mirena coil), we have not been using condoms. However, a few days ago after we'd had sex, my partner showed me some little patches of broken skin on his penis, both on the head and the shaft - certainly no more than 0.5cm in diameter, and mostly smaller. They looked as if they were little blisters that had popped, although he said he hadn't noticed any blisters previously. They were red and looked a little raw, just like under a popped blister, but he said they didn't feel like that. He also mentioned that he's seen them previously after we've had sex (possibly quite a few times), but not as badly as that; he's never experienced it with any of his other partners. He says that they do not hurt, but are a little sensitive - and they heal up or disappear within a few days. I have had no symptoms like this, but we've both noticed that when we go to the toilet our urine smells more...pungent than usual, and I have noticed that mine is more cloudy, as if I'm dehydrated or something. I'm fairly confident that I do not have a UTI or cystitis, as I've had them before and know how they feel.

My initial thought was that it could be herpes, but having both had the all-clear from the sexual health clinic it seems unlikely. I'd wondered whether the 'string' from my IUD was causing the skin on his penis to break, but that also seems unlikely, as my previous sexual partner never had that problem, even when the coil was newly inserted. He says that sometimes just as he is entering me it feels as though there isn't enough lubrication, even when I'm really wet - that sometimes it feels a bit friction-y, but after that it's fine. Surely that won't be causing it?

Any thoughts on what this could be would be great! We're thinking about going back to the clinic together to ask them but just thought I'd see if anyone here had any ideas or experience of something like this.

Many thanks!"

I'm using a throwaway, for obvious reasons.. but I've been having some sexual health issues lately and it's got me concerned and really quite down.

A couple of months ago I ""lost my virginity"" (for lack of a better term) [F 26]. Long story short, I ended up sleeping with this guy (unprotected) in the heat of the moment/ drunken night. I immediately went to get tested...I knew him, but not well enough to know his sexual history, so I thought better safe than sorry. Everything came back fine. 

Fast forward about a month later, we had sex again. This time protected (non-latex condom, as I found out when I was in my teens that I was allergic..and I chose to never test that theory). He took the condom off during sex, and so again we ended up unprotected. About 5 days later I had the WORST itching..ever. It started by me ""examining"" myself, I felt like the skin near the vaginal opening was a bit dry/rough/bumpy, and then I got worried, kept poking around and in doing so caused my vulva to become extremely red/irritated and itchy. I wasn't sure if it was related to sex, feminine wipes I had recently used etc etc. I believe it lasted about a week (mind you it was also a 30 degree summer weather week too, which..sorry but can cause a bit of uncontrollable sweating..which I'm sure didnt help my cause). I tried vagisil and Summers eve wash, which I felt calmed it down.

It seemed to go away, and then the next time we had sex (fully protected) I felt irritation about 5 days later too.. I started chalking it up to lack of fore-play, thinking that maybe it was irritation caused from chafing. 

Just tonight...it started back up (very mild so far). I havent had sex in about 3 weeks, so it's not chafing..just a general irritation that is happening specifically at the bottom part of the opening of my vagina (between the vagina and the perineum.. like almost under that ""fold"", if you will...[prays other people have this fold]).

The first time around, I went to the doctor and mentioned it (expecting an exam) but at that point it had subsided... she said that she would normally just had treated the symptoms anyway (i.e. epsom salt bath). 

But, the fact that this is lingering and I've NEVER had any vulva/vaginal issues before becoming sexually active (even if it didnt happen after my first time), makes me wonder if there is some sort of fungal infection/ skin irritation? I was initially terrified that I had caught something such as herpes/ genital warts..but as nothing other than tiny skin irritations has flared up, I feel like I'm in the clear in terms of that.

Sorry this was so long, but I'm really looking for any insight/ shared similar experiences you may have.. I realize most/all of you will tell me to go to my doctor..and I plan on making an appointment tomorrow.. but something to put my mind at ease or help me cope in the meantime would be nice...as I've generally been feeling quite low about all of this.


TL;DR: Have been experiencing mild - severe vaginal itching, not sure what the root cause is, and how to deal with it."

Early on in the relationship he let me know just how important sexual health was to him, and basically said he wanted us both to get tested before having any sort of unprotected sex. COOL. I mean, who doesn't want that? It turns out my insurance wouldn't pay for it without symptoms because it hadn't been a year for me, so I went to the county health department.

They are very careful with privacy, so I have very little evidence of that visit. I called for the HIV results when I was supposed to and found out everything was fine. He was refusing to go down on me (not that I was asking, really, but talking about how he would if I would get tested) until I got the results. Well, fine. Results gotten, sex still mediocre. Anyway, he then finally went out and to the best of my knowledge got tested too, but lives in another county. Two weeks later he claims everything is clear.

About a five days to a week after the only time I had unprotected sex with him I started bleeding irregularly. I was on the pill. and that sometimes happens to me, so I didn't think much of it. I also already had a gyno appointment to make sure my PCOS isn't acting up. No big deal.

So I bled for month, was pulled off birth control, and then started spotting again. Today I went in for a pelvic.

At the pelvic I was told that my cervix is bleeding, not my uterus, and that I likely have an STD. They are running another full panel (though not HIV, because it is too soon) and I am so pissed.

They did not do a cervix swab at the county, but they did blood tests and I peed in a cup. Is that enough? Could I have gotten a false negative? They tested for everything.

I was already sort of planning on breaking up with him, but I am UNGODLY ANGRY. I have been in pain for a straight month, and have never had an STD before. The internet claims this is likely gonorrhea or chlymadia. 

I do not want to wait 10 days for the results, and likely longer because of Thanksgiving, to tell him it's over. However, it might just be bacterial vaginosis. Maybe. There are other reasons to break up, of course, and I could focus on those.

My biggest problem is that I am currently involved in a national job search, and I will likely be Googled heavily. If he posts crap about me having an STD it will be found, and I worry that about of the Christian institutions I have applied at will not hire me for it. Actually, I just worry about being judged by people that might hire me period. 

I know that if I tell him he will immediately accuse me of faking the test or being unfaithful. I have done neither. It's been over two months, so I'm not sure I can call back in for the results again, so I don't even know if I can obtain proof that they were negative.

I feel like he is obsessed with sexual health, but either forcing his partners to get all the testing done and not doing so himself (and somebody did not do it) or just flat out lying and getting off and giving people this stuff or just.... weird. I thought it was strange that he made such a big deal out of it, since I've certainly been in relationships before where we exchanged testing dates and information but it wasn't brought up over and over again.

I obviously need to break up with him, but it's a bit of an LDR at the moment and I am worried about his temper, him posting about me, or him even showing up here. I am so angry and unhappy though, I can't put this off. So Reddit--how would you deal with it? I don't want to just break up with him and lose contact (I'm not sure whether I have his real number or a Google Voice one) if I do find out it's an STD, because he needs to know. I also don't want to break up with him over having given me an STD if he did not (there are other reasons to do so)."

I'm going to try my best to give it up in order to boost sexual performance. It's going to be tough.

This is going to be a tough one, but totally worth it. I'm entering a weird border zone in life where I'm not really young anymore [34m] but not really what I'd call middle aged. This means that while I still have a decent amount of youthful energy left, my body doesn't recover from abuse as fast as it did when I was 21.

I am admittedly a heavy drinker and my diet isn't the best. While I'm not so fat I need a scooter to go shopping and I can make it up several flights of stairs without needing a break, there's no denying that I'm overweight to the point I don't subject the public to my shirtless mid section. The drinking (which wrecks testosterone levels) and the excess fat has started to create some moderate erectile troubles. I don't as hard as fast as I used to for the most part and I've noticed my time to ejaculation has decreased over the last 10 years.

My desire to fix this isn't simply a matter of pride. My wife recently turned 30 and it turns out the so called ""dirty thirties"" are a very real thing, at least for her. She's been hornier than ever and has expressed an interest in experimenting with a whole bunch of hot, kinky, adventurous new things and dammit, I don't want to be tuckering out on her now.

I recently started a new job that is very physical and doesn't allow a lot of time for eating, plus it involves a lot of outdoor work and sunlight boosts T levels. I know I'll lose a good amount of weight in the coming months if I can make a few small dietary changes and stop drinking a case or two of beer every weekend. 

It's going to be tough, though, because to be honest, I'm likely a borderline or better alcoholic. But, sex makes me feel better than booze, so that should be a decent motivator."

Obviously most Campuses or Counties have (basically) free sexual health services but I feel these are more often than not, underutilized.

Or at least we were dating. Over the past few weeks I noticed her avoiding me and being distant over text. Finally a few weeks ago we met up over coffee. After a few minutes of small talk, she pulls out an STD health pamphlet and a test result. Uh-oh.

As it turns out she had [trichomoniasis](http://www.cdc.gov/std/trichomonas/stdfact-trichomoniasis.htm). Apparently 70% of people who have it never show symptoms. She was in the other 30%. She had itching and irritation and a strong smell in her vaginal area. Got it checked out and was diagnosed. Her last relationship and sex had been 2 years ago, so she had to have gotten it from me, even though we'd only had sex 3 times up to this point, each time using a condom. 

A few months before meeting her I'd been seeing a different woman. I was serious about her, but I found out that she was crazy to say the least, and quite possibly/probably screwing other guys at the same time. We only had sex a handful of times, all protected, except for one foolish encounter when we were in the backseat of my car and couldn't wait to get back to my place. After that ended I waited for a bit then went to go get tested just in case, and everything came back clean. I never showed any symptoms or any reason to believe I had something.

But if her last relationship was two years ago...it had to have come from me. All I could really do was apologize and tell her I never wanted to cause her any physical or emotional harm. She was friendly about it, but said she wanted to just be friends. She'd never gotten an STD before and didn't want to continue a sexual relationship with a guy who'd given her one. Again all I can do is hang my head in shame.

The next day I went to the clinic and got the full work-up of tests. The doc told me that it's difficult if not impossible to detect it in men, and gave me some medicine to take anyway. I went back the following week and my results came back all clean, including a test for trichomoniasis. I told this to my now ex-gf, but it hasn't really changed her feelings about things. 

That's how she feels and there's nothing I can do to change that, but at the same time I feel cheated out of a relationship. I got tested, used condoms, and something that I showed no symptoms for and doesn't even show up on a test for still burned me. I really liked her and I'm bummed that our new relationship had to come to an end this way. For about a week I felt like damaged goods before a friend pointed out that I'd given her the sexual equivalent of a cold. We'd probably still be dating if all I'd given her was a runny nose and sore throat. 

I kind of want to make one final try to salvage things. She may not change her mind, but I don't want to go down without a fight. What can or should I say to her? I am really, really sorry she caught this, but at the same time I feel like I've been screwed by circumstances. Is there anything I can do?

And as an aside - I learned that STD's aren't necessarily the end of the world. Why do we treat them that way? At the same time - always use protection, get tested regularly."

What information can you give me about risk prevention other than not kissing when he has an open/weeping sore and using dental dams for oral sex? What's the likelihood of transmission when he isn't having an outbreak? If I do contract oral herpes from him and have an outbreak or active form of the virus, will I need to use condoms/dental dams for oral sex with anybody from then on out? Forever?

Any other information would be greatly appreciated."

I have been travelling the world for the last 5 months. It's been an awesome adventure and I have tried to be safe as possible while having all kinds of fun. 
However Sometimes uncovered BJs and drunk sex occurred and I'm uncertain how well I protected myself. . Not quite ideal, but that's in the past. 
Anyway, those encounters are in the past, and contrary to Rafikis belief I know that the past can hurt in the future. 
The thing is I'm not back in my home country for a few more months and want to get checked out sooner rather than later. 
I'm currently in Finland, it's a lovely place and had top notch health care I'm sure. My question is that can a tourist generally just find a GP and request a health check up or do I have to find certain places to go in this country? 
Also this would be my first check up in any country as I have only recently lost my V card. So any advice on getting a check up would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks"

I also have my period coming up the day after tomorrow (which will clear it up). Tomorrow I'm seeing my friend with benefits/summer fling and we're going camping with a bunch of people. Presumably tent sex and drinking will ensue (not in that order haha).

But, my discharge is gross and he can't go down on me (risk of oral yeast infection), so I feel that it would just be easiest to tell him instead of fending off oral sex and trying to hide gross discharge. How can I mention this while not ruining the evening? What's the best way to bring this up?

Relatedly, I'm a lot dryer than usual and yeast infection discharge + irritation doesn't make for the sexist of times. We usually use condoms, but not lube. Would using lube solve this? How do you clean it up after while camping (no access to showers)?

I also have a fear of him pulling out and having clumpy discharge over his finger or dick, is this likely?

Thanks for any advice!

Update: in the end I went to a 24/hr grocery store and found a pill that only take 24hrs. I was going to just wait, but I wanted sex and didn't even realize that there were oral options! (The vaginal meds can't be used with condoms, so I wasn't going to use the tabs.)"

I just found out 9 months in that my gf has had a lot of partners. I myself have had 10, but even I thought that was overkill given that I  care about sexual health more than just getting laid.

She has been testing her whole life and says she is clean. To be brutally honest, I didnt force her to show me the lab results and she didnt ask for mine either. We stopped using condoms about 3 weeks in and she has an IUD. 

I dont feel comfortable having sex with her anymore due to sexual health concerns. I understand that even if she has hasnt noticed any STDs or been tested positive for any that there is still a risk that something may be laying dormant in her, and that I could have contracted it. She likely did not use condoms with all the other men and was most active in her teens and early 20s working in the bar industry and travelling.

I myself have been tested during our relationship and so has she. Nothing was found. Are there any STDs that are not normally tested for that I should insist on the doctor asking be screened? (Canada). 
 

I like her. She is a great source of moral support in my life right now and we get along. We dont use condoms because we prefer bareback, and the relationship probably wont survive moving backwards to condoms since she will know its because of her sharing her sexual history with me. I need to know if there is any way I can continue having sex with my gf without feeling like im playing roulette with my health since statistically speaking I am at risk being with her.

At the moment, I am considering:

1) telling her I need a break from sex because I have somewhat of an addiction (an /r/nofap type of reasoning) EDIT: *This was a cheap time-buying tool I thought of at 3 am when I made the post*

2) Breaking up with her and hoping we can stay friends. This might be doable since I'm pretty sure she must still be friends with at least some of the guys she's had sex with. Although its probably easier to stay friends with someone u had sex with briefly.

3) asking her (EDIT: *US..US.. I meant us*) to do all the testing I need to feel at ease. Of course I will do them with her, but she will know it is because of the recent news she gave me and will be upset since has ""already been tested and is clear from everything"".


Please help me figure out if there is a way to feel completely secure having sex with my gf again or if there will always be a risk.."

   As the title says, my girlfriend has been having recurrent yeast infections for the entirety of our relationship and we're basically at the end of our rope trying to figure out how to deal with it.  We truly don't know what to do at this point and are starting to get concerned for the future of our relationship. We've known since a week after meeting each other that we are ""the one"" for each other, and the possibility of something as stupid as pH balance tearing us apart is something that neither of us even wants to think about. And frankly, I hate watching what this is doing to her. She feels so helpless and defeated, like her body is betraying her and she has no idea how to make it stop

First one popped up about a week after we starting having sex, she went to Planned Parenthood and was prescribed a single dose of Diflucan. The infection cleared for about two weeks, then started up again. This time she went the Monistat route, and after 10 days of no progress ended up going back in for another dose of Diflucan. Same result, ok for two weeks, then right back where we started. Another Monistat treatment and 10 days later things seem to be back to normal. Low and behold, two weeks later and she's feeling another one coming on.....

We've done plenty of research trying to figure out the root cause of the whole thing and have pretty much come up dry. I have no symptoms what-so-ever, even went so far as to be checked by a doctor, who looked at me like I was nuts, and to apply Monistat to all my fun bits and surrounding areas for about a week. So i doubt I'm just passing it back to her.  She is very healthy in all other respects, eats very healthy, yogurt every day etc... She is on hormonal birth control, which she started taking shortly after we started seeing each other after having been off it for 2 years (Had taken it for 8 years before that). When we are able to have sex I do come inside her.  She has not tried hardcore probiotics yet, and hasn't seen a doctor besides those at Planned Parenthood. I suppose the only other bit of pertinent information is that there is a pretty decent size difference between us.....she's 4'11"" and tiny in all respects. I'm 6' and....rather girthy in the downstairs department. Not sure if that could be having any effect.  

So, I'm really hoping that someone out there may have some similar experiences and might be able to shed some light, or give some advice, and provide some sort of resource that may be able to help us out. I know that this post is a little vague on the more nitty gritty details, but she's not comfortable talking about this stuff directly online, and I'm trying to do what I can for her. I'll answer any questions as best I am able. "

Edit: This would all be much more acceptable if it were a fact that my vagina smells ""fishy"". I wouldn't go through this trouble if that were the case. That would be really awkward to tell a woman if it were so noticeable &amp; I'd empathize with feeling afraid to bring it up. However, I have a nose. My other partners are all very honest and also have noses and tongues that are functional. It's just not true. It smells just fine. Like a human body part.

I met a 27 year old guy through OkCupid who is in an open relationship and lives 200 miles away. This probably seems a little desperate but I live in a dry ass town and am very picky about who I kiss. I’ve just been trying to get laid by someone who knows what he’s doing since my ex and I broke up and he moved to NYC. This new guy, who I’ll call my little Fuckboy, is, frankly, a very good-looking dude. Just exactly my physical type. Kinda perverted, great looking cock (even though it’s got some serious nerve damage from years of severe punishment while he was a junkie and probably had to strangle it half to death to get off). We seemed to be a good sexual match, somewhat intellectually compatible (or so I thought), and both agreed it was an NSA, sex-based arrangement with the potential to be more. 

Fast forward a few weeks. We’ve seen one another on 2 occasions. First, I swallowed my pride went to him so as to respect his primary relationship and get some head. Sex was great. Got along. Had fun, blah blah blah. While I’m there, he brings me to his “favorite” café where I see a beautiful woman. After privately remarking how pretty she was to him (seriously, so hot), he tells me that she and her two friends hate him and don’t speak to him because of some small-town drama. Apparently, he fucked two of these three girls and they both wanted to date him but he wasn’t interested in them romantically. I think, yeah, I guess that’s plausible. He’s hot and cool. He’s older than them. That makes sense. Thinking back now, the Bojack Horseman line comes to mind: “When you’re looking at someone through rose-colored glasses, red flags just look like flags.” 

After a few fun days, I leave and go home. Once I’m gone, online he’s all “I think I’m falling for you. I’ve never met anyone like you. Maybe when you graduate we can move to the same city.” No shit. He said this. I have proof. 2 weeks later he comes to me. Sex is still great. Got along, except for some bothersome mansplaining about addiction and the dangers of my drinking habits. (I’m a very well-adjusted, mostly independent 23-year-old student on summer break with a CLOSE acquaintance with addiction: homeless father drank himself to death, brother is a 6-year strong addict, ex-boyfriend is a recovering alcoholic, crack heads and drunks littering my extended family, you get it. I don’t need a sponsor and certainly don’t need to be warned of the dangers of what has shaped much of my life thus far because Fuckboy wants to seem like he’s street-wise. But I digress.)

So the second time around, he’s staying at mine and calls out of work to stay with me an extra day. Great, sure, fine. We have sex like a million times over these 3 or 4 days. Things got kinda sore. We probably should have taken it a little easier, but the sex was good and we were into it. He’s like, “If you find someone else in your city, will you just promise not to forget about me?” I’m like, “Aw, sweetie, yeah, of course” but kinda also thinking-- well, if I find a reliable dick in town and you’re already in a relationship with another woman 200 miles away, I’m probably just going to go down the street instead but, sure, whatever makes you feel safe. Finally he leaves. Coincidentally, my ex, who I’ll call Humphrey, happens to be passing through town from NYC the same day that Fuckboy is leaving. I haven’t seen him in a while, still have a very close relationship, so we make plans to hang out. Fuckboy and I have sex, jerk the living shit out of his numb ass cock, and talk dirty about how my ex is gonna come and get his sloppy seconds: “you’re not gonna tell him, are you? How wet my dick makes your pussy?” I’m into it, he’s super into it. 45 minutes later he’s gone and my ex is picking me up to take me to dinner. Humphrey happens to be bisexual with some cuckold tendencies, so the overlap is really not an issue for him. (Or me, cause we’re all clean as a whistle and let’s be honest, it’s kinda hot.) Then, my ex and I go down the rabbit hole for 2 and a half days. We get a hotel, basically don’t leave, fuck, eat, sleep, repeat. Fuckboy knows what’s going on because I sent him a suggestive selfie from the hotel room, captioned “My ex licked your cum off my pussy last night.” I’m thinking, any red-blooded man would love to get this text, right? Well, now I’m not so sure. Humphrey and I are posting cutesy selfies and interactions on Facebook. Clearly we’re still in love, having a great time. This should all be fine: Fuckboy just left to go home to his girlfriend. Suddenly, the ensuing conversation happens after Humphrey and I have an adorable back-and-forth on Facebook about pooping. A few minutes later I get these texts, which I’ve transcripted and paired with some commentary in parenthesis. The screenshots are linked above. 


Real quick, before we get there, I have to mention how VOCAL Fuckboy has been about his feminist politics, the importance of consent, respect, his disgust for men who try to manipulate and control women, his fear of bordering sociopathy like his violent father. He said to me, “If I EVER do something mean and manipulative to you, will you please let me know? I don’t ever want to be that way.” I remember first looking at his OkCupid profile which had this long bit about how he hates men who claim to understand and respect consent and boundaries but actually just say that to get in women’s heads/pants. Immediately, my gut reaction was “this bit seems pretty manipulative” but then I scrolled up to his pictures and accidentally decided that he was hot enough to give the benefit of the doubt. I almost resent to compliment his looks so many times but, it’s true, and I’m just trying to paint a clear portrait of where my head is at: strictly trying to get laid. He, on the other hand, may have been more interested in trying to get some sort of twisted satisfaction out of me, mistakenly thinking that I am some lonely, desperate, young-minded, malleable and weak girl, and, hilariously, he might have even thought that I am less intelligent than him. (No such luck, buddy.) After we (figuratively speaking) play 21 questions about our most traumatic experiences, there are nearly no secrets on the table. We agree: we both can only seem to connect with people who’ve experienced trauma. He knows I’m a childhood sexual abuse survivor and, presumably displeased with his obvious lack of control over my heart and my pussy, misjudged his ability to body shame me:

&gt; - Him: Fyi… maybe my dick is just sore from fucking you so much, but… I’m worried something else might be going on. (Translation: I don’t really have a good reason to think that you gave me an STD but I’m going to worry you anyway and ruin your pleasant afternoon with your ex.)
- Me: Um…really? Why? What’s up? I haven’t noticed anything and was tested before I slept with you and after my previous partner. I’m planning on going in again this week though just to be safe. 
- Me: Can u respond asap? Kinda not a great thing to hear
- Him: Have some mild general bladder discomfort, pee drips, frequent urination. I noticed the last day that you had some like whitish discharge but I thought it could
- Me: I wouldn’t be surprised tho, you kinda choked the shit out of your dick lol. White discharge is 100% normal. Do you ever get urinary tract infections? I know for a fact that I was/am clean before you so…
- Me: That’s just my cum not a symptom
- Him: Be dead skin from inside you from how hard we were going. Yeah, I think it might be from smacking my dick on you honestly because I’ve had it happen before. (Translation: I really don’t have a good reason to think you gave me an STD because this has happened before but let me say something gross about how I maybe saw dead flesh come out of your vagina and casually remind you that I cock-slapped you. Note: We were rough but it really wasn’t THAT serious.)
- Me: Oh, that’s gross. Yeah my pussy was def kinda raw but I’m gonna go to the doc this week and make sure anyway
- Me: Also realistically an STD wouldn’t already be giving you symptoms sounds much more like a UTI. Is your piss cloudy?
- Him: Okay. Also, you’re probably going to punch me in the face for asking, but do you think you have bv? Yeah, I think I might’ve traumatized my urethra tbh. (Translation: I see that you’re responding very reasonably to my intrusion, so I’m going to kick it up a notch. But yeah, again, just want to reiterate that no, I don’t have a good reason to think you gave me an STD.)
- Me: Bv…?
- Him: Bacterial vaginosis… it’s a super common imbalance that is p harmless but changes your smell and texture. (Translation: I’m a theatrical asshole.)
- Me: Hm… I mean, I don’t think so. There are fluctuations with the smell and discharge throughout the month but uh… I’m not sure I guess it’s possible? Can ask my doc just to see…
- Me: I think we’ve just been brutalizing your cock lol. But I’ll let u know what happens at the doc. Going in Monday unless I get weird symptoms before then
- Him: Yeah ask… I think ya might. I didn’t really give a fuck, still ate ya, but it can eventually cause discomfort. Easiest thing to cure. I think you take 1 dose (Translation: I see that you are STILL responding reasonably, but my intention was really to hurt your feelings, so I’m going to reiterate that I think your pussy stinks and use some really disrespectful language. But don’t worry, I’m just telling you because it might eventually cause you discomfort. I wouldn’t want you to be uncomfortable.)
- Me: Everyone smells and tastes different lol. Sometimes there’s an odor but it doesn’t mean my vagina is infected. I’ll let u know what happens
- Me: Is this something you were noticing the whole time or just 1 or 2 days? Cuz my vagina feels fine and does smell sometimes but more of a coppery/iron taste than fish. *censored* is corroborating this w me. 
- Me: Online it says fish but I’m p confident that’s not what I smell like lol
- Me: Anyway be nice to ur cock its been thru a lot this week. Ttyl
- Him: Well it got more intense between the times we’ve chilled. It’s a fishy smell (I see that you are, despite my best efforts, STILL responding reasonably so I’m going to double back and say it again: I think your pussy stinks.)
- Me: Ok well this conversation took a turn. Ima have to check out before I say something rude. I’ll get looked at. Have a good weekend.
- Him: You okay…? You do the same. (Translation: Oh, have I offended you somehow after reiterating three times that the whole time we were fucking I actually was grossed out by how you smell?)
- Me: I’ve been seen by a gynecologist twice in the last 6 weeks and got tested 2 weeks before we met. I’m definitely okay, a little annoyed. Seems like very improper etiquette. A little disrespectful. Don’t ever tell a girl her pussy smells like fish. If you think there’s something up go to the doctor yourself instead of blaming it on my supposed bacteria-infested vagina. Good luck.
- Me: You probably have a UTI that has nothing to do with the levels of bacteria in my vagina. I know you’re looking out for your health and your girlfriend but there are ways to deal with this shit. A phone call woulda been preferable. I’ll be in touch if something is up.
- Him: I don’t know about you but I think having an open dialogue about sexual health is important. Not trying to threaten or feel threatened. (Translation: Wow. This is about your sexual health. I’m telling you this as a favor. Don’t threaten me with very sound advice and an incredibly well-mannered temper.)
- Me: Um…ok…yeah…and I’ve been open the whole way through. Openness doesn’t negate the necessary tact and sensitivity. I don’t wanna argue. Go to the doctor and I’ll do the same before I self-diagnose. 
- Me: U can’t just be like, hey, didn’t mention anything before but your pussy smells and I think you have this thing. Lol. Its rude. But thank you for your concern as poorly as it may have been delivered.
- Me: Phone call next time dude. Common courtesy.
- Him: Well I was afraid of offending you and don’t really know how else to bring it up except directly. I’m not judging you or saying you’re gross or anything. I mean I had my tongue 30 inches in for God’s sake. It’s not even harmful. (Translation: I wanted to bring it up directly so I fucked you 20 times and then randomly texted you in the middle of the day while you’re with your ex. I’m not sure if I’ve been disrespectful enough, so I just want to provide you with the image of my sticking my tongue way up your pussy even though it stinks. You’re welcome.)
- Me: Ok. Use the phone next time. 
- Him: Okay, just please don’t be aggressive with me, already didn’t wanna bring it up. Talk to you later. (Translation: You need to calm down. This was already uncomfortable for me as it is, having to casually tell the woman I just fucked that her pussy sticks. And then say it again. And again.)
- Me: Well u did a shitty job so sorry to react aggressively but u shoulda been a little more sensitive. Cya
- Me: You also came in my pussy over and over and over again. Maybe you’re smelling yourself lol. But usually I wouldn’t say that cause its very rude and disrespectful. 
- Me: Lol. Don’t men know not to say shit like that? Rly I don’t know what u were thinking. I just told u I’m going to the doctor for YOUR comfort and peace of mind, not even out of my own concern n u had to push it. Don’t ever tell a woman her pussy stinks if you wanna fuck her ever again. Words to live by. I’m gonna need an apology from you at some point
- Him: I smelled it the first day we met, but disregarded it because I know it’s harmless and being like “sorry, not gonna eat you out because you smell weird” is rude (Translation: I really wanna bring this one home, so I’ll reiterate it one more time very clearly. Your pussy is gross but I did you a favor by eating you out. I couldn’t possibly imagine being so rude as to tell you this to your face.)
- Me: Oh wow lol, you shoulda really folded and apologized immediately. You’re a grown ass man, *censored*. You rly should know better.
- Me: Yea, I think ya fucked it up pretty good actually. That was either really manipulative or really dumb.  Not impressed either way
- Him: I’m sorry I hurt you. I don’t think we should talk anymore. I wish you nothing but the best! (Translation: I really wanted to hurt you. But I’m realizing that you STILL are responding reasonably and are clearly a bigger person than I, so I’m going to pretend to have no ill will. Also, I am a theatrical asshole.)
- Me: Um, ok man. Lol. That was weird as shit. No wonder you make so many enemies. Good riddance.

It's taking a toll on our relationship and my attempts at self control have only been marginally successful. What can I do to eliminate this bad habit? Any advice is appreciated. All I've got so far is ""well, just don't do it."""

So last year I got a very bad eye infection, first doctors said it was chronic conjunctivitis, next they told me it was clymidia ( that day I learned you can get the infection in your eyes). 

We went to the clinic, got tested and they both gave us the medication to get rid of it, infection cleared up a while after but it also left me with a droopy eye (not very noticeable, but it does bother me. When we got our test results, I came back positive but he came back negative. I went on the pill a few months prior so we stopped using condoms. 

Before meeting my bf, I'd only had sex 2 times, once was with a guy who had not slept with anyone before and the second time we only had sex for a minute or so (condom came off so we stopped). So this also confused me as I don't know how I got the infection in the first place, and in my eye as well. My bf got tested a few months before we got back together and he said that everything came back negative - adding to the confusion. 

I joked with him that he cheated and passed it onto me before getting rid of it himself but if you've seen my previous posts you'll know he has a very low sex drive and we also live together, at the time he was unemployed so we were together most of the day, so no real opportunity to cheat unless he's some sort of infidelity ninja. So that can't have been a reason. 

Has this happened to anyone before? You got an STI but your partner didn't or vice versa? 
Wasn't sure if I should post this on this subreddit or if there is anywhere else that might be able to shed some light on this, but I thought I'd be able to get more responses on here. 

TDLR; I got an STI, boyfriend didn't, confusion all round.

If we need to lubricate, we use UberLube. His length is too much for me at times, and it can cause stomach pain. I rinse outside (and what I can reach inside) with water after our sessions.

From age 16 to about 19... After 20, when I had a bad breakup, I slipped into a deep depression, and turned to porn, developed an addiction, and soon later, physical issues. My penis later became hard in its flaccid state, libido absent, and erections weaker. This continued, and still does up to now, at 24 years old. Up until about 23, I numbed myself out from my issues for those 3 years my smoking weed all the time. Now at 24 my problems have just gotten worse and I don't know how to cope...

 About a year ago, I discovered my problem with the hard flaccid penis and erection was likely due to pelvic floor muscle dysfunction. For some reason, because of how deep I was into my issues, I didn't work at it right away and just went further along with my bad habits... Enter now.. symptoms are, varicose-like veins on both side of the penis, spider-like veins on my penis... and ever since about 4 months ago, I've been having to urinate about every hour and a half, and its always foamy when it hits the water (and kinda in a strange way, abnormal foaminess). I've had my testosterone tested 3 times, Dec. 2014 (412), Feb. 2015 (336), July 2015 (276)... I think the reason for my low testosterone is the deep depression combined with a lack of blood flow down below because of the extreme pelvic floor tightness.

I went to the urologist about 2 months ago, who did a prostate secretion, and a week later the results came back that it was positive for bacterial growth. Boom. Chronic Bacterial Prostatitis on top of all this other crap. I've seen horror stories about how people can never get rid of the bacterial version of it... I feel hopeless.. It's literally impossible for me to develop any kind of relationship with a woman right now with what I'm going through... Is there a way out of this???

I took a month's dose of antibiotics as prescribed and it didn't seem to help in the least. A physical therapist I'm seeing says that even a healthy guy could come back with results showing positive for bacterial growth and believes its just an extremely tight pelvic floor... The reason I don't believe that is because of the onset of the ""foamy"" urine and constant need to go hitting at the same time, and I don't know the rationale behind having a positive test for bacterial growth and not having an infection.... Also I've heard of guys who can never get rid of the infection?? Will I ever be able to love/live again?

I know this post is pretty dang long but I don't even feel like I'm covering everything, this is brutal and I really want to reach life on the other side."

Now to what I thought was a completely separate issue, an overall tightness in my pelvic muscles, which has also been going on since I was ~16. This pops up every now and then, especially when I don't have enough fiber for a while, when I'm dehydrated, and when I'm in the car for a while (2 hours or more). accompanied with this pain is an almost painful constipation, inability to urinate / urge to urinate frequently, pain in the very bottom of my tailbone, an incredible pain in my testicles, some sort of half flaccid erection and potentially premature ejaculation. The pain associated with this is to the point where it keeps me up at night, but is relieved some with masturbation or completely with aleeve.
The only thing that keeps me from seeing a doctor about the second issue is the fact that it doesn't happen very frequently, 
Once a week or so when it's very bad.
after a little bit of reading i'm wondering if the Verricocele be caused by whatever is causing the second issues?

If anyone knows any stretches or exercises that will help this I'd much appreciate it since it's nearly impossible for me to do a reverse kegel"

It's been about 10 months since we posted in here. Some time has passed, and we've made some great progress in raising money for sex-related charities. We had some great suggestions in the past from this sub, and are looking for some more suggestions to help spread the love in 2016.

For those that don't know what we do, here it goes:

We run a web site called ""[Hump the Bundle] (https://www.humpthebundle.com)"", where we bundle together NSFW content (video scenes and picture sets) from various adult web sites and put them online for time-limited flash sales in support of charity. We allow users to **pay-what-they-want** for the porn bundles and allow them to choose how their money is divvied up- between the content partners and charity. It's a part-time gig for us. There's only 3 of us working on the project, yet somehow we've done about $150K in sales and raised about $40K for charity in our first year.

Our current bundle is in support of the [National Coalition for Sexual Freedom] (https://www.ncsfreedom.org), which we have supported for a little while now.

The current bundle is called the ""[BustyPetite Xmas Bundle] (https://www.humpthebundle.com/bustypetite.html)"", which is a collaboration with the fine folks at /r/BustyPetite. 

I believe the NCSF charity connection came out of a suggestion from a user on /r/Sex, so we are very thankful for that!

Our last post also garnered some media attention which led to an on-air interview with our Co-Founder ""Humpy Leftnut"" on the Dr. Drew ""Loveline"" show.

We were also featured in a number of articles online:

[Orgasms for World Peace - Salon.com] (http://www.salon.com/2015/03/04/orgasms_for_world_peace_a_charity_porn_site_cant_give_its_money_away/)

[Fap for a Good Cause - DailyDot.com] (http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/hump-the-bundle-porn-charity/)

[A Stroke of Genius - TechGage.com]
(http://techgage.com/news/hump-the-bundle-a-stroke-of-genius-with-surprisingly-no-biters-nsfw/)

We're looking to gain some insight on some new charities that we could support in 2016, and also if there are any avenues that we can explore in getting the word out about our operation. Due to the nature of the content that appears on our site, we feel that our biggest obstacle is suppression in the Media and social circles. Why is it so taboo in 2015/2016 to discuss pornography with your peers? Obviously, we understand the concerns about age and the negative aspects of the sex industry, but pornography is legal for a reason.

We're looking forward to hearing from the great minds here at /r/Sex.

Happy Holidays!

The pain varies from moderate annoyance, to searing hot iron on my urethra-basically debilitating. It usually lasts up to an hour depending on initial severity. It seems to be extremely common when I google it, but there are no real answers as to why it happens and how to alleviate it best.


For me it seems to happen about once a month. I usually have sex 3 times, and masturbate 3 times each per week. It's happened on and off since I was 13 so I know its not an STI. The doc has never known what it was when I've brought it up. Several courses of assorted antibiotics used for other reasons haven't taken care of it.


It seems to happen most when I'm dehydrated. More frequently from sex instead of masturbation. More frequently when I finish in a sexual position that bends the shaft of my penis a bit. More frequently when I have sex soon after masturbating, or cum too much in too short of a time frame. When I play with my ass it usually happens in higher proportion to regular masturbation.


The only thing I've found that helps is to ice the whole region , and relax until the pain dies down.

Does anyone else have this issue? What do you think k brings it on, and how do you deal with it?"

When I was first sexually active, I loved it. I couldn't imagine a better sensation and generally wore my partners out trying to go longer and more often.

I acquired HPV and developed anal warts down the line, and had them surgically removed. The recovery process results in a pain I wouldn't wish on anybody. I've asked multiple doctors about this and they've all told me this procedure shouldn't have had an effect, but I'm suspicious.

I was also diagnosed with stage 4 lymphoma a few years ago, and have been in remission for quite a while now. Now I know this sounds a little silly and might be a little TMI, but after a few treatments I had one memorably painful and strange-looking bowel movement. I asked the nurse about it, and she just said in her years working in oncology she's seen and heard about all kinds of strange poops, so I shouldn't worry.

The timing between these two occurences is very close, and I can't say for certain whether the decreased pleasure occured before or during these events.

Has anyone else experienced or heard of sharply decreased levels of pleasure in male anal sex? Regardless of whether chemotherapy or surgery played a role, I'd like to see if it's possible to regain that pleasurable feeling. I've spoken to multiple doctors, a psychologist, had my hormone's tested, and I've run out of ideas."

I'm posting this in the hopes that it might be able to aid others like me who are experiencing sexual pain and not sure where to look. It's a relief to finally know what the problem is, but it was definitely not an easy road to get here. 
  
  
**Backstory:** I'm a 19 y/o cis lady, I got into my first relationship about two years ago and things were generally good. We were able to communicate well and we took it very slow, sexually speaking. Neither of us had any religious or moral hangups, we were both just inexperienced and in no rush. We'd had oral and manual sex, oral was nice but any attempt on his part to finger me was pretty uncomfortable and I would usually stop him. About eight months into our relationship, we tried to have intercourse for the first time. It was wholly unremarkable, both of us trying for about two minutes until I tapped out due to the pain. At the time, we both thought that I was probably just tight and it would resolve itself in time. My boyfriend and I broke up when I went off to college and I didn't have any sex during that time. Finally, when I got home for the summer we resumed dating.
  
  
**The jig is up:** Fast forward to October 2015, it's been a year and I still can't have penetrative sex. I finally realize that this can't be normal. Honestly, even as a person fascinated by sex ed and growing up in a liberal area, I'm *amazed* how long it took me to realize that something was wrong. I'd still been subconsciously buying into the myth that first-time sex hurts for women, even though I knew it shouldn't. I would even give my other friends all of the typical advice: go slow, use lube, communicate, even though none of that helped me. I figured it was mental, or just a phase. Finally, I realize that I'm trying to just ""push through"" and do it even though it's excruciatingly painful and not getting better. Neither me or my then-boyfriend were enjoying ourselves, and it sucked. Desperate and emotional, I go to the nurse practitioner at my school's student health center hoping for answers. In what was probably the worst doctor's visit of my life, she calls my vagina a blossoming flower and keeps trying to hold my hand (irrelevant, but I'm still prickly about it-- I was in no state to be coddled, I needed a doctor, not a mom). The one helpful thing she says is that it isn't vaginismus. Okay, sure. But (as I knew due to extensive googling) that didn't take me out of the woods. I had something going on, and it was big and scary and mysterious. 
  
  
**I Get Some Goddamn Answers:** Frustrated, I wait until I get home on winter break to see my regular OB/GYN. By this time my boyfriend and I broke up (unrelated to sex), but dammit this is my body and I still want to know what's happening. I get in to see a physician's assistant and after an exam she gives me the most hilarious diagnosis ever: *my vagina is too buff*. What??
  
  
Basically, the [muscles around my vaginal canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulbospongiosus_muscle) are too thick and can't be stretched enough to accommodate penetration, at least not without significant pain. This is just a genetic thing, unrelated to kegels or other pelvic floor exercises. Unlike vaginismus, it's not an involuntary tensing-- I am still in control of the muscles, but they are just too big.

I was so afraid that she wasn't going to believe me, or tell me it was just because of anxiety. Now that I have an official diagnosis, she referred me to physical therapy and a follow-up appointment which might involve some injections. It's not going to be a quick process, but I'm incredibly relieved that I am in control of this and I can work towards a solution. Dyspareunia is really discouraging and it sucks feeling like your body is working against you. Hope this can help anyone else who is looking for answers, thanks for reading. 

**Edit**: Thank you all so much for the support! It's really interesting reading others' experiences with this. To clarify, I was also recommended dilators but I'm not going to get into that until I start PT. There is some very gentle massaging that you can also do. also, since I never added a TL;DR:

**TL;DR My vagina is too strong and powerful for mere mortal penises to handle, also pretty much anything else, gotta go to PT to reduce my sick gainz**"

I'm a 23 YO male, I just got my first STD check done and got my results in, it took me too long to do because I was scared. I though I would share my experience, answer questions, and encourage people to get one done themselves. I live in Austin TX, I can only speak for my area but the RBJ Public Health Center does checks for $20 and is great.

I hadn't gotten tested before because I was afraid it would be too public, too expensive, and I was scared of what a positive diagnosis for an STD would mean.

About my fears and why they shouldn't have stopped me;

1. I thought they would mail my results to me and my roommates/parents would see if I didn't get the mail, or it would get out somehow. 
In reality they gave me my HIV result before I left and I got a phone number and security code to access my full results once they were in. No letter, no embarrassing jokes/talks, nobody beside me and the doctors know anything about my health.

2. Cost, when I looked it up online there were a bunch of ""clinics"" offering discreet STD checks but they came with $100-$400 price tags.
 I did actual research when I decided I had to get it done and found that the public clinic you should actually go to costs $20, the rest is taxpayer funded. I could have, and should have, done this a long time ago.

3. I was afraid if I did have an STD my sexual life would be over.
While looking up information I found out that the vast majority of STD's are curable/treatable and you shouldn't be scared of having one, you should be scared of having an undiagnosed one. Besides HIV the most common STD's can be cured with antibiotics and you can resume activities in a few months, and HIV requires treatment you can only get once diagnosed.

Getting tested was easy, cost me very little, and didn't take as long as I thought it would, I was done within 2 hours. I'll be here to answer questions for a few hours, if you have concerns ask, but don't keep going unchecked, get it done, it's not as hard as it seems.

BTW I'm clean, no STD's, Yay!

Edit 1: I forgot to say, I didn't need to get nude to be checked either, it's done with a small blood draw and urine test now, so no doctors starring at and prodding your junk. So don't let your shyness keep you from getting checked either.

Edit 2: The Test's themselves; They drew two small vials of blood and had me do a urine test. The blood test was me walking into a room, sitting down, them inserting a small needle into my left arm and drawing blood from there. The urine test was me walking into a private bathroom, peeing in a small cup they gave me, putting it's cap on and then placing it on a designated shelf inside the bathroom. They didn't use a cotton swab on my penis but apparently they still do that sometimes."

I'm a bit embarrassed to admit this as I'm a virgin - but after fail after fail after fail I finally had a little bit of intimacy (and now I'm worried)

To start, I've never even kissed a girl... and last night I sucked on a breast and I'm worried.

I've just been so sick of all my friends having luck with women and me not.

From what I can see its no problem at all, but I don't know, I tend to get paranoid (Maybe that is what stopping me actually finding a woman on my own)

I'm currently in Indonesia (Bali) with my family. I've been going to the dance clubs here and had no luck even talking to anyone. Not even the local girls want anything to do with me

So on my way home last night I stopped in at a massage parlour and worked up the courage (I was a little drunk) to get something ""extra""

Anyway I had success and at the end of the massage the woman agreed to ""massage"" me downstairs in which I came.

Basically after an hour massage she rubbed oil on my penis and I ejaculated after about 30 seconds.

She also removed her bra and let me suck on one of her breasts for a little bit.

I'm pretty embarrassed here to type this -  and even though I had her breast in my mouth for no longer than 10 seconds, there was no fluid or any discharge or anything that didn't look like a normal, dry, nipple... but now I'm wondering if I can get HIV from this.

I don't have any cuts or anything from I can see on my lips either.

She seemed healthy, which I know means nothing and other than her touching me downstairs quickly with oil and my loosely sucking her nipple, that was it.

But of course-  paranoid me is worried.

My family would be so embarrassed and un supportive. I think they'd probably kick me out of the house. Especially my older brother who never stops giving me a hard time and my step dad who i've never really ever spoken to in detail whom I know doesn't really like me much

Anybody shed some light it would be great if I should be worried.

 From what I can see most documentation says its not a big deal but i'm just worried because I'm overseas and in Bali (indonesia country).


I guess more importantly... why can't I just be normal and find a girlfriend :(

I'll never find one if I get HIV or Aids

I've been having a weird problem the last 3 years or so. I have a boyfriend and we have sex regularly, but I've never had an orgasm. This doesn't really bother me that much because I still enjoy the sex.

However, often (especially when I enjoy the sex a lot), I get this really weird pain/feeling in my crotch after. It's not a burning or itching sensation so I've never really been worried about it being an infection or something because it only happens right after sex. But it's really uncomfortable and keeps me from falling asleep as quickly as usually.

So for the question in the title, I was reading an AskReddit thread today and saw a description for blue balls, and it matches my feeling exactly! It's ""a constant dull ache in the balls and a slight feeling of tightness."" except instead of being in the balls, it's sort of in my outer labia.

So. Can women get blue balls? Am I getting this feeling because I'm being stimulated towards orgasm and getting physically horny, but not achieving orgasm? And if not, does anyone have any idea what could be causing this feeling?"

Sometimes this does not happen, but usually it does. This pain also only happens whenever I start becoming erect, or when I'm erect. While my penis is flaccid, no pain is felt.

&amp;nbsp;

Things that seem to ease the pain are obviously staying flaccid, peeing seems to ease the pain, and applying pressure on the bottom side of the penis, like I'm scratching the ducts that go from the bladder to the penis. I've tried to talk to a doctor and I could not explain very well, while I assume I got the idea across, he still said that he couldn't figure out what it could possibly be.

Another thing is, no matter how much I clean myself down there, it seems it always has an undesirable smell after a couple hours.

&amp;nbsp;


I have been checked for STD's, I'm a very healthy person aside from my constant migraines and being a little overweight.

I can't believe I'm even posting this... here goes.  

This is going to sound weird but my husband is rather well endowed (we're talking over 9 inches) and we've been together for 16 years.  When we first started having sex near the beginning of our relationship sex hurt a lot - especially when he'd hit the back of my vagina.  Certain positions were frickin' torturous and therefore pretty much out of the question.  

Over the last 5-10ish years we've had 3 kids, and after the last one, I noticed that he never really ""hit the back"" anymore and seems to be able to go ""balls deep"" which he could never do before.  I asked him if he noticed a difference after our 3rd kid and he agreed there was a difference.  He says when he gets to the back of my vagina there is something that feels almost like a second tight hole and if he keeps pushing he can go through it.   I can only assume this is my cervix.  

About a year ago my OBGYN mentioned I have a slit in my cervix so instead of it being shaped like a doughnut, it's more shaped like a letter C so it can't fully close.  She didn't seem too concerned about it but I never asked the OB about this because I didn't make the connection that this was why my husband could go so much deeper than he ever could before.  

My husband loves the new VIP access - thinks it's the best thing ever and that it feels awesome, and honestly I like that full penetration doesn't hurt anymore.  The only thing either of us find annoying is that a lot of times when he penetrates that second ""tight hole"" I often bleed a little.  I don't think the bleeding is from damage or anything or it would probably hurt - at least that's my guess.

My question is this: Is this a problem?  Do I need to worry about infection or anything? I would think if he's penetrating my cervix he's either only partially penetrating it or going all the way into my uterus, and if so should I be concerned?  I realize I should probably just go back to my OBGYN and ask but I live in a pretty small town and see my OB everywhere.  I prefer the anonymity I have on reddit so I thought I'd start here.  "

I've had three testicular surgeries to get rid of a giant varicocele on the left side, and finally after the third attempt the massive veins are gone, but the pain is still there. The 4th time was a ""minor"" operation where I had a steroid injected into the spermatic cord to try and block the pain. This has all taken place over the last 3 years

It just fucking hurts all the time. Sex is painful for me. Nobody, not even me is allowed to touch or grab it or else I'm in severe pain for several hours. It hurts when I wear jeans, and usually when I walk/run. Puts me in a bad mood constantly and really has impacted my life.

My doctor says the only two options left are:

1. A permanent surgical nerve block to stop all sensation from the testicle. This freaks me out, because I've read horror stories about things getting worse, and nerve pain in brand new spots. Or damage to nerves that deliver pleasure from the penis.

2. Complete removal of the testicle and replacement with a prosthetic. This worries me, because I've read that it can cause changes in sexual arousal and interest. Just the thought of having to make this decision makes me feel sick inside, like it might become a huge mistake.

Just tell me what you would do in this situation. Or does anybody here have experience with any of this"

Since then, a couple more patches have shown up, and I know we're both starting to worry.

 I don't live with him but I usually spent weekends at his house, and we both have very high sex drives, and typically have sex 1-4 times a day when we are together. I know this frequency is exasperating his condition, but I also wonder if it is the cause as well. To me, the patches look similar to psoriasis, which I know runs in his family. Is it possible that my vaginal fluids triggered some kind of psoriasis outbreak (for lack of a better term)? Has anybody experienced this type of condition? What did you do? We also purchased some penile health lotion and while it is making most of his cock velvety soft, it hasn't done a ton for those small red patches. Any advice welcome.

We always have long sessions of foreplay and I can cum and sometimes even squirt with oral sex and fingering (it's never been an issue). But I really like PIV. I miss having g spot and cervix orgasms. I've noticed that sometimes, after he makes me cum from oral sex, he makes a pause, goes to the bathroom and stays there for a while. So... is he masturbating before starting PIV? Anyway, when he comes back, he comes within seconds. I've tried to take control and start reaaaaly slow, but it seems to make no difference.


I'm wondering that if I don't talk about it, he won't either. So how can I mention it without hurting his feelings or worsening the problem? Or -- maybe is there something else I can do during sex?

We use condoms when we have sex and follow all common-sense rules about hygiene and protection.

I have done just about everything I can in the western medical world to get treatment.  I would say I am a solid 60% better than from it happened but some days are really bad, while others are totally fine.  

There is very high chance that I will have post-ejaculatory pain for a few hours (think intense cramp in your lower pubic area) after masturbating or sex so I often have to weigh the pros and cons if its worth having sex right now if I am going to be uncomfortable or in pain for most if not the rest of the day. Its hard to swallow that thought that you have to make decisions based on your chronic pain like that. Sexuality is not a fluid experience for me. 

I honestly think I have only masturbated 3 times in the past year because the pain outweighs the pleasure. I am on a forced no fap challenge essentially.  And no, Its not boosting my confidence, lol. I am wondering, is there anyone out there who has had similar problems on this sub, male or female? how did you chose to go about self-treatment and professional treatment.  Were you successful, did it naturally go away or is it there to stay and you live with it like an evil twin sticking out your side? It feels debilitating because it makes me very sexually insecure as I have such little stamina because I have a relatively inactive sexual life (I maybe have sex once a week).   

TLDR: I have had chronic sexual pain for over 4 years now.  Been to top specialists on the east coast with limited success.  Anyone have similar experiences? Am I possibly seeking the wrong therapy and should I consider seeing a psychotherapist instead?"

In October 2015 I [22F] had a bad sexual experience with a partner who really hurt me and since then I have cut all contact with them and haven't had any new sexual relations with anyone. 

I can have fun by myself and there are no problems, but when someone else comes into the picture... I remember what happened and I feel uncomfortable and I want to stop. The same thing happens even when it's just dirty talking through chat messages. 

I'm not getting full blown anxiety attacks or anything. I just feel uncomfortable because I am reminded of what happened, I get turned off, and then I'm not in the mood anymore. Is there anything you guys suggest? I'm guessing I should go to a therapist but as I said, it's not really that big. It's just a minor inconvenience and I want to get to have sex and flirt with people again.

Title got kinda weird, I'm sorry!

I'm a 25 y/o male, with huge libido. But I'm anxious, and a chronic worrier. I'm the kind of person that thinks about having a brain tumor when I have a headache. I overthink a lot. And, plus, I started having the famous ""psychological ED"". I can get boners in  the morning, I can get it imagining stuff, touching myself, touching a giel, or even out of nowhere. But when it comer to the physical interaction, my penis start to get softer, until it goes dead, simply because I had a bad experience...
I always had a normal sexual life, and I was always labeled as a ""horny"" guy by my girlfriends.

Anyways, the point here is: I've read A LOT of guys saying that, besides learning to get less anxious (meditation for that), stopping masturbation and watching porn ended their ED problems.
But, I've seem some people saying that if you don't masturbate (ejaculate) for a long period of time, it can make you have some health problems. 

Is it true? Any of you have been in the same spot as me?
Can I stop it without worrying about my health? 
And can I do the PC and Kegel exercises without a problem?

Thanks in advance!

We always use lube and change up our positions. I went to the doctor and they ordered a transvaginal ultrasound and it came back normal, so they sent me to the GYN, who says that since the pain wasn't in the vagina and the ultrasound came back normal, it's not GYN related.

Every time I have sex with my SO I end up with a yeast infection. In my previous relationship (also, the only other person I've ever had sex with), I never had this issue.

I was also having tremendous issues with UTIs at the beginning of our relationship, but I solved that by peeing immediately after we finish and then washing up. We are long distance, but see each other anywhere from 2-4 times a month. During this last year with him, I have had 20+ yeast infections, plus a handful of other times BV. It is horrible.

I have tried probiotics (although admittedly not consistently), cranberry juice, washing before and after sex (both of us, including brushing our teeth and tongues), and I no longer allow him to cum inside me. I have seen my gyno several times over this issue, and she sort of just shrugs it off like ""well, that sucks, heres some antibiotics again and eat some yogurt, also make sure you let all of the cum drip out of you before doing anything else"".

It has gotten to the point where now I have to decide if I want to satisfy my sexual urges or not by thinking ""Do I really want to have sex badly enough that I have to call my gyno again tomorrow and admit to yet ANOTHER yeast infection?"" It is soo horrendously embarrassing. Not only that, but all of the people at my pharmacy already know my full name just based on how often I have to go in for yeast infection meds.

We are about to move in together and I am horrified of the idea of having to continuously turn him down because my body is rejecting what happens to my PH when we have sex.

I asked a friend of mine and she recommended much more intense probiotics that you have to keep in your fridge ( Ultimate Flora Vaginal Support). She also suggested that my SO and I may not be sexually compatible based on our natural PH levels... But we are committed to being with one another for life and I can't just throw the relationship away over this. There has to be something I can do that I just haven't heard of yet. I also tried changing my diet to exclude most sugary foods and other items that yeast seems to love.

TLDR: Has anyone out there had an issue with recurring Yeast infections/ BV? If so, how did you overcome it?

So, the short version is this. We're mid 20s. I'm a guy, I'm her first, she's not mine. We've been sexually/romantically active and exclusive for four years. Recently she's been having an issue where during sex she imagines unwillingly, like it just pops into her head, that I'm not her boyfriend, that I'm a stranger and that she's being raped, which is of course very disturbing and she has trouble relaxing and enjoying sex because of it. She has never been raped, but on occasion an ex-boyfriend hasn't stopped touching/kissing her when she wanted him to. But she doesn't think that's the problem, and it doesn't entirely explain why it happens during intercourse. She needs to, like, convince herself that it's me over and over again to even go through with it. Also, she has a severe kind of empathy for anyone who suffers/suffered from sexual molestation, such that if it even crosses her mind that people sometimes get molested, it's like the electricity is cut and she's completely turned off for a while.

She has been seeing a counselor recently and talking to her about some past family issues and I think maybe that's why her troubles are on her mind recently, but I still am not sure why she has such a strong and specific reaction. She's also said this happened when we started having sex four years ago, but after a short while everything was fine, until the last few months, during which it's really started to disrupt our sex life and to some extent our romantic life. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? Please help if so, thanks."

Maybe twice a week, which was plenty enough for me.  With full time jobs and responsibilities ( no kids yet) we dwindled down to two or three times a month for a few years and still enjoyed it.  

Over the last three years our sex life has become me asking and her reciprocating but only if I'm lucky enough to catch her on a day where there is no stress or other problems to put her out of the mood.  We've had our arguments and she mentioned that she feels ""asexual"" after looking into her problem.  She loves every aspect of our life, and sex isn't bad, she just has no drive to want to do it nor anything in her head that gets her going any more.

Obviously I'm a bit rocked by this, I have been struggling accepting that someone ""cant"" be sexual with someone or find them attractive and take it very personally even though I know I shouldn't.  We talk more about the situation and she divulges that as a child her parents made sex a very big no no, but in our early relationship this didn't seem to have any effect.

As of this weekend while discussing this I find out she was sexually abused but she says she never remembered until recently.  This leads me to believe that she may be hiding something else.  Reasoning behind this is that she has hid things from me, nothing that was between us, but things her parents did that was abusive (physically/mental) or situations that made her umcomfortable because of childhood memories.  She's been to therapy for this and is much more open in most regards, but this sexual abuse came out of no where and I can't help but think there is more.

I'm not sure what I should be doing - she suggested a sex therapist prior to the abuse admission, and I was all for it.  I am now wondering if she should go back to her regular therapist for the abuse?  This has been very stressful and sorry if incoherant, I'm trying to be supportive but at the same time I don't want to do the wrong thing."

Had sex with the same partner for a third time and a very weird large amount of goopy fluid came out of my vagina half an hour later.


The first time we had sex I Did NOT bleed. I bled TWO days after slightly. 

The second time we had sex we stopped because he checked the condom and there was blood on it.

We waited two days and tried again. Today we stopped very quickly because he checked about two minutes into us having sex.

Blood once again - but not too much. What really freaked me out was about half an hour later while we were walking a large amount of clear/yellowish fluid came out of my vagina. Enough that I was wearing a dress and I could feel sole
Of it on my leg (TMI sorry). I'm quite worried.

I have a history of ovarian cysts on my ovaries so I wonder if this was an internal cyst that broke?

I was in quite a bit of pain after and am still horrified. 

He was recently tested and is clean. 



TLDR: weird yellow clear goopy fluid post sex with a condom. Should I be worried? 

Any ideas?

Where do I start so late in the game?

Here's the deal.
I am a 26M who has been married for 4 years, and been with my partner for 6 years total.
Recently, I have begun to correct my deadbed - primarily through calm and assertive communication, with myself spearheading and leading discussion (primarily about conflicts). Things have improved, especially in regards the the atmosphere of the house. A sense of ease is in place where there was tension.

That being said, I feel like I am still missing part of the puzzle. 

Now, examining how I have approached discussion and recieved positive results (I mean that in the least manipulative way), I am wondering if I need to apply an assertive, calm and directional approach to the sexuallity of the relationship as well. 

So, my question is ""what can I do to inject more dominante traits into the sexual aspects of my relationship?"" My entire life, I have approached sex as ""both people should meet on even ground,"" but I am second guessing that dogma.

As it stands, I have nearly zero experience in regards to the sub/dom roles in  a relationship other than what I have heard/read second hand. That being said, I really have no intrest to apply domination in a literal sense (punisments, bondage, diciplines, etc.) But to demonstrate a better control over sex.

Id appreciate any thoughts, advise, stories or literature recommendations. Feel free to ask if you need more info.

Thanks

(BTW, I was unsure whether to go here or BDSM, someone let me know if it is appropriate?)

There's a weird looking patch of skin inside my urethra that looks pale with red blood vessels running through it, kind of like an ulcer, and it hurts like a mother if I touch it. 


It started very suddenly one day when I went to pee and mid flow I felt a sharp pain and noticed some blood. Since then it's been painful nearly every time I pee but no more blood. It's usually bearable but every couple of months it flairs up to the point where I can't go about my normal routine due to the pain and discomfort (feels like there's a hot poker being shoved up there). 


Naturally I went straight to the doctors but after nearly two years, three different GPs, four urologists, a flow test, two ultrasounds, several prostate exams, seven or eight STI tests (for everything!), courses of two different antibiotics (30 days) and two different antivirals (one for 3 months), countless urine tests and a cystoscopy, nobody can tell me what's wrong or how to treat it. 


I'm negative for all STIs, no bacterial or viral infections found. I've been with my gf for nearly three years now, she was a virgin before me so I'm unlikely to have caught anything off her and she hasn't shown any symptoms in all the time we've been together and has had a couple of STI tests which were negative so she hasn't caught anything off me. 


The last urologist I saw was the top guy in my area and all he could say was ""yeah that's not normal, I dunno, just leave it and see what happens"". 


Needless to say I'm not really very happy with just seeing what happens. So reddit, have any of you seen or experienced this before? Does anyone have any advice about where I might be able to find more information/ask advice? Or are there any really good urologists I can contact that might be able to help? (I'm in the UK btw). 


I know reddit isn't the place to get medical advice but like I said, I've exhausted all other routes.

I really need your help. I'm a 24 year-old woman who's been sexually active since the age of 17.

My first time with my boyfriend of 3 years wasn't too painful. We broke up eventually and when I was 22 years old, I had non-consensual sex. I couldn't stop it and, helpless, I had to make a choice: I could either physically persist fighting it and possibly develop vaginismus or try and loosen up to do the least amount of damage.

I definitely was in pain because there was only so much I could control. I was in pain afterwards as well. I'm in physical pain every time memories of that are triggered and I become incapable of being aroused, sometimes even for a whole month.

Every time I've had sex since then, I've had pains. Penetration is not impossible, but there is a very deep and sharp pain especially at the start and in certain positions. From the guy's perspective, it feels like I'm closing up on them or it's like they're hitting a wall and this can sometimes be uncomfortable for them.

I saw my gynaecologist to get an official diagnosis and hopefully a treatment. Please note that I live in the Middle East, where sex before marriage is frowned upon so there is a lot of ignorance and shame surrounding sexual health. Her medical examination was extremely painful. I mentioned everything in this post and she said that I should just try to relax and make sure I am in the mood for it before engaging in sex again.

I recently started dating someone I really care about and I'm very attracted to him. We slept together for the first time two days ago and I couldn't possibly be more ""in the mood"" for sex. It was awesome but I did experience a lot of pain deeply. I'm still in pain two days later. It is very hard to experience this on an emotional and physical level and I fear it will drive my partner away.

I am already seeing a therapist and I just read about exercises that I can do, which I'm going to start right away but I really wanted to know, is it vaginismus? It confuses me because my doctor didn't give me an official diagnosis and penetration is possible...

TL;DR: Sex didn't hurt until I had non-consensual sex. Doctor couldn't give proper diagnosis. Penetration is possible but there is a sharp pain deep inside and hurts for days after intercourse."

After I posted this it was suggested that I might want to post it as a text post here for anybody with similar concerns. So here it is:

Ok, here goes, I'm going to attempt to answer some of the points brought up both of you.

First off, I need to emphasize that while I am a medical professional (Medical Technologist/Clinical Lab Scientist), I am not a primary care provider and I am not advocating that you get any testing performed, just trying to increase your general understanding of testing. Costs of testing and which tests are more common will change between hospitals/healthcare networks so I won't be suggesting what would be most cost effective for you to have done. That is a discussion you need to have with your care provider and your insurance provider.

That being said, testing for STI's has come a long way since the days of horrific collections involving a lot of ""scrapings"" of various areas of your anatomy. The majority of tests can be performed on serum and urine specimens (though a direct swab is still considered to be a better quality specimen, even for PCR applications) and are not that uncomfortable to have collected. The tests and methods I will list do not vary much within the United States and I would assume wouldn't vary much internationally but I do not have experience working in labs outside the US so YMMV.

Blood tests: These will generally be for your viral STI's and are usually run through some kind of immunochemical reaction process (whether that is direct or indirect will just depend on what methodology the testing site uses), though some PCR tests are available. A fully comprehensive panel could include:

Hepatitis A Antibodies (Class G and M)

Hepatitis B Core Antibodies (Class G and M)

Hepatitis B Surface Antibodies

Hepatitis B Surface Antigen

Hepatitis C Antibody

HIV Antigen/Antibody Panel with Confirmation (In some areas HIV testing may still be split up into HIV 1 and 2 testing. In my network it is a combined test with the Ag/Ab panel testing for both.)

RPR (This is actually for syphilis testing, which is caused by Treponema pallidum [a bacterium], not a virus but this is still the best method for identifying syphilis infection)

Note: For both Hepatitis C and HIV there are PCR testing methods but these are usually used in accidental exposure testing for medical or research personnel or for keeping track of the viral load of patients previously diagnosed with either Hep C or HIV. As for Hep A and B, most people have access to immunizations for both of these so the incidence of actual infection in the US (and many other first world nations) is very low. If you have a positive antibody titer for either of these check to make sure you were vaccinated in the past. If you were, then the positive antibody tests are expected and do not indicate infection.

Urine/Swab Tests:

Neisseria Amplification

Chlamydia Amplification

Trichomonas Amplification

Note: All 3 of these tests use PCR methods to unwind existing bacterial DNA and match a testing primer (which can be either RNA or single strand DNA) to that bacterial DNA and then amplify it's volume through successive cycles of heating and cooling to allow enzymes in the testing kits to basically build new bacterial DNA strands. Because of the minute detail of this process, these tests are highly specific for specific DNA patterns and less prone to false positives than previous methods. These tests are where the urine v swab debate occurs. In general a urine specimen should be ok to use provided the patient has not urinated within the previous hour and collects only the first 20-30mL of urine provided so as not to dilute the bacterial specimen. The general consensus in the labs I've worked in is that, though urine specimens are adequate to use, swabs specimens are still superior for testing due to having better potential to directly access the area effected and gain a ""purer"" (in the sense that there is no diluting media, such as urine, so the likelihood of detecting infectious bacteria is increased) bacterial sampling.

Additional tests:

Herpes Viral Culture/Typing: this is another swab test which, in some cases, requires a combination of viral culture and PCR testing to ID which Herpes Simplex virus is the causative infectious agent.

Genital culture: this will involve a swab (urethral for men; endocervical or vaginal for women) which will then be used to setup media plates for growth and ID of bacteria. This testing is not performed as often as it used to be and usually takes longer due to growth rate of bacteria.

As far as the swabs only being used when clearly symptomatic, this is usually true. However, if a patient has significant concern that they may have been exposed to an STI and sufficient time has passed for an immune response to have occurred, then testing can be performed, even in the absence of overt symptoms. 

As far as the best place to go or what costs will be incurred, that will depend on your area. If you have a PCP, I would make your first inquiries to them. If they can order that testing (and I can't imagine a case where they couldn't) then just set up an outpatient appointment with them and explain your concerns for your sexual health. As far as cost, that will depend on your insurance and how much testing costs in your area. I would encourage you, if you do have concerns that you've been exposed and don't have a PCP, to go to an urgent care center in your area or start asking family and friends who they go to for outpatient medical problems and try to set up an appointment. These would be your best pathways to getting your questions and concerns addressed.

Unfortunately, blood tests will necessitate needles for collection and other test could involve urethral swabs (it's not that bad, I had it done after finding out about a promiscuous ex, actually I had it done 3 times over the course of a year just to be absolutely sure since I knew who some of the various partners were) but frankly, a small amount of discomfort now is worth having confidence that you are healthy.

Hope this helps anyone with similar questions and please, everyone, be active in maintaining your health. Use preventative measures whenever possible and do not just take somebody's word that they are clean, especially if this is a one night stand sort of situation.

So, about 90% of the time during sex or when I pleasure her in anyway, she will just have...what I can only describe as a ""blackout."" Her eyes usually roll back (*which is something I think is crazy hot*) and she is mostly unresponsive and somewhat suggestible; if you tell her to say something she would normally never say, she could do that, but she can't really do much else in that state. When she ""wakes up"" she claims she doesn't remember much except the pleasure. for example, if she gets to that state and i tell her to say something kinky, she will say it, when she ""wakes up"" she doesn't remember saying anything.

I think the whole thing is super hot. It plays into my fantasies and she tells me shes loving every second. **But I need to know if her blackouts are a danger to her health. I cannot in good conscious continue to have sex with the woman I love if it hurts her in some way.** I know thats cheesy and I realistically won't be able to deny myself some form of sexual pleasure with her, but I have to know that she will be ok."

I don't know what I'm expecting from r/sex but at the least I need to get this off my chest, at the most I could use some words of encouragement. Thank you so much in advance if you read this and comment or PM me. And before anyone can suggest it--I've called my doctor's office (closed for the weekend tho), spoken with the NP on call, and she offered with a prescription for a yeast infection or a visit to urgent care. I'm doing the latter after work tomorrow.

So today's Friday. I'm staying in tonight because I've been feverish off and on throughout the week. Nothing over 100.5, but it still feels bleh. Additionally I've had some trouble with my stomach all week. The day before yesterday I had maybe 7/8 bowl movements at work. They haven't been normal ones either. Soft and thin poops, whereas normally I can tell time based on the fact that I pretty much always take a robust shit at 10:30 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. Additionally the lymph nodes in my groinal region have been tender as all hell for half the week. 

That altogether could just be a flu. But the coup de gras (more like coup de flaming assholes): there are some PAINFUL bumps helicoptering around my anus. 

At first I thought it was razor burn. I'm a pretty hairy lady. I've got tit hair, ass hair, belly hair, lower back, etc. My boyfriend doesn't mind (bless his soul) but I prefer to shave it all away because I don't like the idea of all that rubbing up on him if he's gonna be rubbing up on me. I shaved eveything front to back last weekend and noticed a little butt-bumpage a day or two after, picked at it a bit, thought little of it. It's been so itchy since though. The other night I woke up and was overwhelmed by the urge to scratch like I was digging for gold. It hurt but I still wound up scratching the bumps open. Whoops.

I'm hoping it's just an infection because the bumps are talking up residence in some unhygienic real estate. But I don't think it's just a passing infection. I saw a photo album with a ""textbook herpes outbreak"" elsewhere on reddit and it looks exactly like what I'm packing.


***Tl;Dr so far: shaved my butthole earlier this week, now my anus might as well be singing ""soores to the left of me, discolored skin to the riiiiight and here I am, stuck in the middle with you"". Fully planning on going to go cry at a doctor tomorrow.


What's really tough about this is that this idea that I must have herpes feels so final. I know there's a lot of hsv-positivity on this sub but something about the idea of having the herp just seems like a death knell for my self-worth. It's crazy because I certainly wouldn't judge a person's value based on their sex life, but it still feels like it'll be a huge blow to my already super okay self-esteem. How do you move beyond just feeling shame? 

Not to mention I'm terrified of the implications this has for my relationship. This is my second relationship/second partner. He's had many more partners than I have. Not judging, just saying I know where this would be from. He's a wonderful boyfriend. 99.99% of the time he's completely respectful and anticipates my boundaries in bed and the other 0.01% of the time we communicate and figure things out together.

I feel blessed to have someone who's sexually compatible with me and I love him dearly. But thinking that I've been sick this whole week because of our relationship, thinking that the fact that I can't sit down or walk or do anything that involves moving my ass a little without feeling pure AGONY could be because he might not have been 100% forthcoming when we talked about STD tests earlier in our relationship makes me so upset.  

I've been going back and forth between wanting him to just hold me and tell me I'm going to be okay and wishing I'd never met him (followed by instantaneous guilt for feeling that way). At this point I've told him everything about what's going on except that I think all this is herpes. I'm so sure that it's herpes, but I'm still not going to destroy this relationship with accusations because I think I'm smart enough to be an internet pathologist.

But how can you move past resenting a partner who gave you a chronic std? Can you? He went away for 7 weeks for a study abroad program thing and got back a month ago. Could this timing be screaming unfaithfulness? I don't think he would, but I'm in such an emotional state that I don't know if I'm thinking straight anymore. 

Anyways I've spent an obscene amount of time writing this on my phone and I'm all cried out so I'm just gonna hit submit, hope my post doesn't get automatically deleted for violating a formatting rule [edit: it was, lol, had to repost it] or something, and finish reading that new Harry Potter story before I go to melatonin-induced sleep.

I just am so sick of feeling this way and I want to get help but I don't know what to do.


I'm a 26 year old guy and I cannot stop thinking about sex. I know that's pretty normal but the thing is the place I am in my life right now I am just unable to have a healthy sex life and my obsession I think is starting to cause me to have a lot of fucked up ideas regarding sex and women in general.


I have really bad undiagnosed anxiety problems and depression. I really would like to see a therapist about this but I'm not sure who to call or how to even start looking for one. The thing is, my lack of a succesful sex life is one of the biggest sources of anxiety for me and it just feeds into itself, making me even more unhealthiest and even more unable to have healthy relationships.


All of my friends are able to get girlfriends and talk to women and have casual sex with each other but I am always left out. I'm not a virgin, I've probably had a perfectly average number of partners for my age so why do I feel so pathetic? Why do I feel like I'm being left behind and not able to keep up with the sexual escapades of all my peers? Why does everyone else just get to ""go home with someone"" and I get left behind?


I know that I need to stop focusing on it and work on areas that will improve my own life. I want to develop hobbies and build a career path for myself and move out of my parents house. But all I can think about is girls. I literally lie awake at night crying because it such a huge thing to me. I just can't get it out of my head.
Why does everyone else get to be normal and I have to be so fucked up in the head? Why is sex ""not a big deal"" to everyone who gets to have it but it's such a huge deal to me? Why am I unable to work on myself as a person and build a life that I am proud of? Shouldn't I want to improve myself for myself?


I wish I was asexual. Or I just wish somebody would have sex with me. But I've built it up to be such a big thing I'll probably never get to have a healthy sexual relationship.


I want to fix this but it just doesn't feel fair. It's going to take so much time, I can work and work forever but by the time I make any progress it will be too late. I'll never get to explore my own sexuality, I'll never know what it's like to have fun in bed with somebody else.


I know I need therapy or something but I just fuckimg hate the fact that I am so broken and need to be fixed while everyone else just doesn't even give it a second thought. I just want to be normal.
I feel like everyone here is just going to write me off and tell me I'm stupid and to look elsewhere for help but I just feel so lost. God damnit."

All day I've felt this tugging sensation just behind my bladder. I went to the bathroom a few minutes ago to take care of some evacuation and to urinate. what dribbled out was like semen (or whatever the proper term for the fluid that the prostate gland produces). So in typical internet fashion I ask you:

Strange things begin to occur if I attempt to stop masturbating, such as extremely insignificant stimulation (sometimes just readjusting my seating posture) can trigger feelings of quickly approaching ejaculation without orgasm, which is moderately painful. Or there will be a release of seminal fluid immediately after urination, without semen or orgasm, and is quite uncomfortable.


The culmination of these effects has led to a predicament in which I feel I have to masturbate at least once a day to relieve the pressure and get on with my day, but obviously not all times are conducive to such an activity. The physical sensations are distracting me from performing my job and engaging in social activities. There have been numerous instances where I have excused myself to briefly go to the restroom and masturbate so that I may regain some feeling of normalcy.


I believe that it is also worth noting that I have had occasional prostate issues since I was 19 or so: at that age I was diagnosed with acute prostatitis and completed a round of antibiotics. Since then I have a very brief flare-up (literally hours) about every other month or so; or rather, if it is not a temporarily inflamed prostate, the symptoms are extraordinarily similar. I have a few different GPs in the past few years for physicals, and nearly all have noted that my prostate felt ""boggy"" but not alarmingly so.


Unfortunately, the medical literature that I have been able to find has all presented a greater focus on sex addiction, which I feel I do not have, as this feels entirely physical, lacking ""horniness."" So I am posting here to hopefully get some proper guidance on how to handle my predicament, or at the very least slap a label on it that's more precise than ""compulsive masturbation.""

Basically, I've noticed an alarmingly high amount of posts regarding erectile dysfunction at an early age. I see people who are in their 20's and late teens talking about these issues. So I was wondering why this may be happening to more and more people.  I noticed 3 changes in society that may be causing this, and I think people can benefit by trying to minimize the damage they may cause.


1 - An extreme increase in availability of porn.

We are all on our phones and computers 24/7 and this is by far the easiest way to consume porn. You don't have to sneak over someone's house and risk being caught, go to a store to rent a porn, or anything like that. You could literally just go on a lifeless computer, get any type of porn you want for free, and keep it to yourself. This is becoming more and more normalized and of course it's going to change society in a very profound way.

Some teens today may have thousands of sexual experiences before even once having actual sex with a person, and that is likely to have a huge impact on how enjoyable sex is once they have the real thing.


2 - Changing views on sex

Throughout European/American history, the standard has typically been to wait until marriage to have sex. Now the pendulum may have went too far the other way. Obviously, this is debatable, and everyone has a different opinion, but this definitely changes things. I read one post on here where a guy was upset that he waited until marriage and his wife didn't, and now he wants to experience being with other people.  

It's a different feeling to think that both partners have saved this special thing of sex for only each other, and if less people are doing that, it's changing how often people go into a marriage with previous partners. So this is one thing that may contribute to a loss of interest, and a need for a higher and higher level of kinks in a marriage.


3 - More anti-depressant and hair loss pills.

Things like propecia, rogaine, paxil, and zoloft are being prescribed at high levels. For myself, I noticed that these type of pills decreased satisfaction and had a long-term effect. It may not bring on erectile dysfunction, but if you think of it in terms of a spectrum, it may bring sexual health from a 9 to a 7.


I don't think I've seen this topic on Reddit so please let me know if anyone else thinks about this. Do you wonder how much you can give to a partner long-term, or what actions you can do today that may positively effect your sexual health in your 50s or 60s?

Thanks for any possible advice or input."

It was pretty small and had absolutely no feeling even when i tried to pop it. Idk why but i kept trying and eventually it did kind of pop... However, now it has kind of swollen like a red pimple at the top and swelling around it.


So I got it checked today and the Doctor didn't really think it was herpes because last time having sex was more than 4 months ago and was tested after that. She did a lesion scrape or something and it seems like anytime it is irritated or popped or whatever (Even when she scraped it until it bled, it barely hurt), it gets bigger... I got an antibiotic cream, so hopefully that helps.


Actually kind of scared as soon as she mentioned herpes, so I thought I'd post here for some reason. Any thoughts?

My current boyfriend and I started seeing each other/having sex 4 months ago.  
I have been on birth control for 6 years and do not use condoms since I'm very sensitive and they give me yeast infections/UTI's occasionally.  
After a month and a half of us having regular sex/occasional ejaculation inside of me I thought I had gotten a really bad UTI (I get them occasionally when sexually active). I had burning, itching, discharge and a foul ""fishy"" odor. Everything went away on its own after a week or so. We had sex again with ejaculation inside of me and the pain/odor came back the next day. This time the pain went away after a few days but the odor never did. I tried everything for a a few weeks (yogurt, apple cider vinegar, yeast infection creams, vitamin c supplements and Rephresh Probiotics) and finally went to the doctor, he told me it was just a UTI and gave me a 7 day antibiotic.  
I refrained from sex and took the antibiotics with little change in odor. Immediately after the 7 days I scheduled an appointment with my gynecologist. My gyno tested for STD's as well as Bacterial Vaginosis but only BV came back positive.  
I was given a 7 day supply Metronidazole but was to refrain from sex while taking it. After 5 and a half days of taking the Metronidazole all my symptoms were gone and I felt great so I stopped taking the antibiotic early. I have continued to take Probiotics throughout all of this and it has definitely helped the odor to an extent.  
My boyfriend and I were able to have sex for a few weeks with NO ejaculation inside of me and no odor or pain returned.  
About a week and a half ago we were having sex when he 'accidentally' came a little inside of me (seriously it was such a TINY amount) but it came out right away. The next day the foul odor returned. I continued to take my probiotic in hopes of it going away on its own, I ran out and went to buy more but they were out of Rephresh so I settled with VH Essentials Probiotics and some Vaginal Odor Gel. I started using both immediately with very little change and decided to use the last of the Metronidazole I have. I just started taking it again today along with everything else. If things aren't better by the time I've used the rest of the antibiotics I will be going back to the gyno for more.
My boyfriend and I have never dealt with this before with previous partners.  
This has caused a huge hindrance on our sex life and I'm ready for it to be gone.  
I've never experienced anything so annoying and to think it's all because of my boyfriends cum? I've read a lot about BV and the vaginal pH and the pH of semen being different, it's a big factor in some women getting it. Has anyone else dealt with this for the same or similar reason? Is this a reoccurring problem for some? Any methods or products for overcoming BV?"

I've done like a ton of research just online, and I cant figure out what the hell to do. Pretty much looks like at this point that I can never have sex with him, and before you jump down my throat, there is a big reason why. I am polyamorous and I have multiple sexual partners, and I cant risk the sexual health of my whole polycule because I have the hots for this guy.

Okay so here is my question. My research said that even with a condom it only protects against HPV 70%, because its spread skin to skin. What if he is not having a breakout? is the risk still that high? What about other sex acts? What am I going to do? Do I have to break up with him just because of this? Because I really like him. 

Also, so many people have one strain or another of HPV, its likely I have a strain already and so do my other partners. I had the Gardasil vaccine, is it possible if I do have sex with him, that I wont have symptoms or that I wont get it at all because I had the vaccine?

I plan on going to my gyn and asking all of these questions and more, but I'm seeing him soon and I want some reassurance and answers before then. 

If this isn't the proper place for this please delete.

Update: okay so things got a lot more intense real quick because I'm pretty sure I'm in love with him and the feeling is mutual, gonna hash that out soon.

Some of you may recognize me as one of your friendly neighborhood moderators.

I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D. in English (focusing on historical literature and rhetoric), but have recently been considering shifting focus to any career similar to the sort of work I do here on the sub.

Nothing's decided at this point, but I figured I would reach out to all of you and see if anyone has any experience with any sort of career that involved sex counseling or therapy, sexual health, or one of the many related careers that I haven't considered or may not even be aware of.

I've learned through answering questions on this sub, and doing freelance work for a sex advice app aimed at young adults, that I have a real passion for helping people sort out their thoughts and feelings about all things sex-related. So, if possible, I'd really love to make it my life's work (and maybe get paid a little for it).

Any and all (thoughtful and politely worded) advice is appreciated!

5gcqqm,[Sexual Health] [Vaginismus] Always have pain the first few minutes of penetration. Should I [F20] get diagnosed for vaginismus?,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/5gcqqm/sexual_health_vaginismus_always_have_pain_the/,ineedadiagnosis,4,2016-12-03 16:30:39,6,/r/sex/comments/5gcqqm/sexual_health_vaginismus_always_have_pain_the/,NaN,"Hey ladies,

I'm [F20] getting my annual exam in about a week at my OBGYN, and I think I should bring up something that may be a concern.

I am not sure whether I have vaginismus. Here is why:

1) Penetration
Every time I have had sex, the first few penetrations are painful for me. I always anticipate pain, so I tend to tighten up/get tense, and I always need a couple of slow, gentle strokes from my partners until the pain goes away. I have told my partners to give me some patience/go gentle until I sense the tightness going away. However, after some time I enjoy penetration a lot, and I gain the most pleasure from it than from other means of sexual satisfaction (e.g. cunnilingus).

I've had a total of 2 sex partners, both of whom have been average size (5-6 inches). They have both told me that ""my vagina is tight"" and therefore really pleasurable for them (and for myself as well). Now I assume that since vaginas tend to be very stretchy, that they should be able to tolerate multiple sizes and I should not be in pain from the beginning).

In regards to arousal, I do receive a lot of foreplay and do get wet (excrete discharge) before and during penetration. Other times my previous partners and I have used lubes. It is just the starting point of penetration that is very painful for me, and as much as my previous partners have been understanding and gentle with me, I think it is a matter to discuss.

2) Tampons
Now I've only tried tampons once and with one size, so this might have just been a one time thing. I used a maxi size tampon since I was at a school retreat and we were getting into a pool the first day of my period cycle. Therefore, I bought a maxi size since my first day tends to be the heaviest. I was not able to bear the tampon. I was in so much pain. Even inserting it was extremely painful, and after an hour or so I just decided to remove it and not get into the pool.

3) Masturbation
I never have any pain when I self-masturbate. I only use one finger for it. I guess it is the notion that I am in control that I tend to loosen up a bit.

What do you ladies think or have from experience? 
- Are the first few strokes of pain worth talking about, even if I then do not feel pain later on?

I would appreciate any feedback.

My other hormone levels are apparently normal.

There are some potentially related factors: 1) I had a Mirena IUD fitted about a year ago and 2) I have a lot of pelvic health problems (definitely vestibulodynia, a vulvovaginal pain disorder; probably vaginismus, meaning my pelvic muscles are in spasm; probably interstitial cystitis or painful bladder syndrome). 

Now, a Mirena is supposed to partially suppress ovulation but not completely halt it. However, I have found some information online that suggests the Mirena can lower progesterone levels, as it releases synthetic progestin, which can disrupt the body's ability to naturally produce progesterone. Not much clinical research appears to have been done on the subject, though--not much that I can find, anyway.

And all of my pelvic issues are idiopathic, meaning no one knows for sure what causes them. But low progesterone has been associated with interstitial cystitis, and vestibulodynia may have a hormonal component in some cases.

I'm wondering if anyone else has had low progesterone and, if so, what sort of symptoms they had and/or what kind of treatment(s) they tried. I'll be seeing my gynecologist on the 22nd, but I want to have some idea of what I'm looking at before I meet with her.

I don't care about not ovulating, because I don't want kids, but I do care about what this means for my health."

I know there's tons of stuff on this but I still can't seem to get a clear answer how a vagina should smell. I ask because sometimes the smell of my girlfriend's vagina is very potent and can put me off when we're getting intimate. 

Honestly I can't even describe the smell, there's nothing I can think of that even has a similar smell so when sites use words like ""Fishy, Metallic, Musky etc"" I've no idea how to apply that knowledge. It has stopped me going down on her before but that was because the condom made the smell worse (even she said so). I don't think she notices the smell normally and I've talked to her about it and she says she's cleaning properly etc.

When I go down on her at first the smell is very off putting to me but practically as soon I start sucking her clit the smell seems to go away although my dick / hands / face will still have the smell afterwards.

The smell is always the same but how potent it is varies greatly from barely anything until up close - to the whole room smelling of it. 

I just want to know if it's normal and I need to just get over it or if there might be something wrong. What should a vagina smell like? Please try to describe it as best you can, words like ""Musky"" don't mean much to me. Thanks."

In that amount of time she's twice had this issue. She gets intense pain in her groin and has also had it in the lower back. Last time I thought she had appendicitis.

This most recent time (this week) she's had blood in her urine and got a fever. The other night she was pale and we went to the ER and they just took a urine sample and referred her to a urologist. Fucking worthless. Can't wait to see the bill for that.

Today she went to a urologist and they did almost the exact same thing: gave her a scrip for Macrobid. Supposedly the doctor also told her she had to take some pills every time she had sex.
I'm really confused by this diagnosis. I'm [very obviously] not a doctor, but her symptoms seem more serious than a simple UTI. I would think she had a kidney stone or cyst. She says she's always had issues like this since 15, before she had sex. She also gets these symptoms when we're not having sex (like when we first started seeing each other).

Any other women here ever have anything like this? I am at my wits end. Doctors just seem so worthless half the time. It's so expensive and half the time they just send you home with a shoulder shrug and vague scrip. And at this point she's afraid to have sex because of the potential pain afterwards.

I've done a search on this sub to read a few threads. Things I'm gonna try (if it does seem like a UTI): get tested for a yeast infection myself, get some D-Mannose pills.

My girlfriend [F19] and I [M18] have been trying for some time to move on from oral/foreplay to regular PIV sex. The issue is that her vagina (irregardless of how much foreplay was done beforehand) seems too tight to accommodate even two fingers without significant resistance/pain. Since my dick is significantly larger than that, the jump from foreplay to PIV is more or less impossible, and on the occasions that we've tried PIV it feels like I'm ""hitting a wall.""

Her suspicion at the moment is vaginismus, but when she asked her current OBGYN for advice she was simply told to see a sex therapist instead since the OBGYN ""could identify nothing wrong."" This poses a significant difficulty due to my girlfriend's mother, who isn't necessarily controlling but is far too conservative to let her daughter see a sex therapist.

Are there any discrete approaches we can take to figuring this out? Thanks."

I am male, 21 for reference.

Back early December, I started to feel pain when during urination and noticed slight discharge. I had been not using condoms with various partners (stupid, I know. I learned my lesson) so I knew something was up. 

I went to health center, got tested, they said it was an NGU. They then said I would receive an email within two weeks if it came back positive for chlamydia or STD, and if it wasn't (I wasn't drinking enough water, diet was bad) they wouldn't email me. They gave me two 500mg Azithromycin and that was that.

Two weeks go by, still no email. I'm in college, so after those two weeks are up, I was back home on winter break. I had had sex the night before and again, felt discomfort. So I had to wind up telling my dad (who was very cool about it) and we go to my doctor. I tell him the story and he takes a look and notices some inflammation on tip of penis and prescribes 10 days worth of Flagyl and I believe ofloxacin but I will double check on that when I can. 

So I take my 10 days worth and I feel fine again.

Now fast forward to last night. I have sex, but use a condom now as I had learned my lesson and had quite the reality check. I notice some slight pain after I ejaculate (orally), but try to shake it off. Today, I urinate and notice it kind of burns a little. 

r/sex, I am worried. I am scared. I am ashamed. I really hope something isn't wrong with me and I just don't know where to go from here.

Thank you for reading. I know this doesn't seem life threatening but this is really messing with me. Any help is really appreciated. "

I have a question for something that's been bugging me a little bit. I (M) have a boyfriend and we recently decided to give anal sex a go. Now, I've done anal before, but he was completely new to it.

Whilst we were getting ready for anal, he was surprised that I insisted we use condoms, on account of my being tested as negative and him never having had *full-blown* sex with anyone (albeit he's never been for a test on this basis, should he do one anyway?). He questioned why it is that I wanted us to use condoms during anal, and why we'd not used it prior (every time we'd done oral) - to which I explained that anal sex naturally carries far greater risk than oral. At this point, he then questioned that if we're both HIV negative surely it wouldn't matter, to which I replied explaining how there are many other infections you might contract, notably bacterial infections (given that it's the back passage and all). 

Fast forward to afterwards and he seemed quite odd. I showered off second, and by the time I'd come back he was already asleep. Come morning, his phone alarm went off and he got himself ready to leave within 5 minutes, just saying that he had a busy day today (uni life).

Just for some clarity, I have the following questions:

1.) Was I right to insist on condoms?

2.) Whilst, yes, since we'd both be HIV negative it isn't possible to contract it, am I right in understanding that bacterial infections and UTI's can be contracted simply from engaging in anal, regardless of whether either participant has an STI?

3.) Am I being a bit too paranoid?

Thanks!"

I am planning on getting a second opinion by going to a sexual health centre and discussing my issue there. I don't want to self diagnose but I don't think it is a wart as: I have not had sex, I have not had any outbreak after it first appeared, and It has been there unchanged for three years. My question is, should I get a second opinion, and how do I go about explaining to the doctor that I have already seen a GP? Not only this but I am scared that if I were to visit a clinic they will be unable to diagnose me as the sore has been partly frozen off. In other words, is there a test that I can expect the doctor to do to confirm I have an std or will my diagnosis be based entirely on how my ""wart"" appears?"

At the beginning of the relationship, I asked if he was tested, and he was a bit defensive by saying that he didn't need an STD test (never had one in his life) because he had had protected sex with only 2 women before (according to him, “condoms protect against everything”), and he said that asymptomatic STDs wouldn't transmit. Because of my incomplete knowledge of STDs at that time, I believed that only symptomatic STDs could transmit, and I found no reliable information on the Internet that said otherwise, so I comfortably went ahead with unprotected sex with him. 

Now that I have learned a lot more about STDs in university, I became afraid (of the dangerous &amp; permanent consequences of some STDs) and expressed my concerns to him.  He argued that he’s not in a risk group where STD test is indicated.  He even says that he's sure he has nothing.  I argued that he cannot e sure because he never has a test done in his life. Although he only had 2 previous girlfriends, both of those girls had engaged in dangerous sexual behaviors before (and had no test to prove that they were healthy), and I’m sure that neither he nor I can tell with certainty how many sex partners they had had. 

To my dismay, he still adamantly refuses to get an STD test (I even offered to get tested myself).  He cited stated Bayes' Theorem and said that STD tests are “meaningless” because: 

- STD prevalence is rare
- he is not in a risk group (he is 24 years old, heterosexual)
- Medical tests more likely than not turn out to be false positives, and that getting antibiotics for false positives does more harm than good, etc. 

He said that if I want to convince him, I can only convince him based on those points. No matter how I calmly expressed my concern that a test is needed for BOTH of our health, he doesn’t care. I’m flabbergasted at how he CAN think he’s not in a risk group given his past partners’ sexual behaviors.

I am, however, unable to prove his points wrong. I told him that anyone who has had sex even once can be exposed to STD but he insists that he’s not in a risk group according to any guidelines. 
And I am unable to find reliable sources to prove that (1) he is indeed in a risk group, (2) STD tests are worth taking despite false positives, (3) STD prevalence is not rare, (4) rates of false positives in STD tests.

Please help me find sources to beat him on his own ground! Though I know that that is just his BS excuse, I’m disappointed that reliable information are so hard to find… 

TL;DR:  Boyfriend refuses STD test by citing Bayes’ Theorem about false positives. I need sources to prove him wrong. "

First time poster here so I hope I'm following the guidelines... 

First of all thanks for taking the time to read about my issue. So the problem I've been experiencing is my girlfriend and I have tried sex (protected) but every time I penetrate she says it's hurts a lot, I'm not a big guy either so it's not that. Before we do anything we do foreplay to get aroused but no matter how much we do whenever I put it in she's almost in tears. We've tried lube, which helped, but not with the pains. After trying a good few times she says it's possible that we're ""Sexually Incompatible"" but I'm not sure what exactly that means. We never really get pleasure as whenever I get any faster or deeper than just the tip she cringes in pain and I'm just afraid I'll hurt her. Although one thing to note that after a bit of very slowly easing it in the pain lessens and I'm able to thrust, but anything faster than very slow is painful for her. 

Tl;Dr girlfriend is in pain  anytime I penetrate, lube and much more foreplay do not work. 

Any advice or tips on how we can make it less painful? Anything is appreciated, thanks! "

She is on lo loestrin Fe and will have a very light period that is usually old blood(brown)

Interestingly enough, one month I fingered her pretty intensely (she was enjoying it), and she bleed quite a bit after, then she missed her usual withdrawal bleed the next week. My theory is that she bleed a lot of her usual withdrawal blood beforehand, thus causing it to not even happen.

5ysiuf,[psychological/sexual health] - I am haunted every moment by a fetish that I despise and I don't know what to do anymore... help?,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/5ysiuf/psychologicalsexual_health_i_am_haunted_every/,fetishhelpme,3,2017-03-11 04:53:20,5,/r/sex/comments/5ysiuf/psychologicalsexual_health_i_am_haunted_every/,NaN,"Hi all, this is probably gonna be a tad lengthy so bear with me please. I hope this is the right place for this because I'm not sure what to do anymore, I feel like I'm at the end of my tether with this.

I'm in my mid 20s, fairly average sex life and sexual history. Over the last few years or so, I've gradually become more and more overcome with a cuckold fetish. It started slowly and grew into an obsession. To cut a long story short, the stage I'm at now is one of absolute self loathing and depression, and I think that at least to an extent it all comes back to this. I hate this 'fetish' or whatever you would call it so much, but I feel like its a part of me no matter what I do, which makes me hate myself. I feel like what was once purely a dirty secret I kept to myself and only as a fantasy now invades everything and I can't seperate fantasy from reality anymore. 

I don't want this, I want it gone but I don't know how to do that. I feel like nothing else can turn me on anymore and no matter how hard I try, even if I somehow one day manage to sustain a normal healthy relationship that it'll be lurking in the back of my head just tempting and tormenting me. All the things I've tried like abstaining, cutting out any form of porn or sex, even snapping an elastic band everytime I think of it just seems to lead me back to where I began. 

It's gone from a fantasy - something two people could theoretically maybe enjoy together somehow to something that actuall invades my view of the world. All the videos I've watched and blogs I've read and stupid tumblrs I've gotten off too have given me this animalistic view of the world where men are ranked from alpha downwards, and that I'm at the bottom. That women actually do want to use me whilst better men use them and that I was born to play the role of loser, both in life and in the bedroom. I can't stop seeing it everywhere I look and it is fucking killing me. I can't stop seeing it in every girl I talk to, analysing relationships of other people through this world view. I can't trust anything a woman says anymore and it all comes back to this. But in the back of my head, even though that view of the world makes me angry to the point of feeling sick, and it makes me worthless and like I don't wanna be a part of it, there's something somewhere in me that's getting off on it. 

Everything that's ever gone wrong between me a girl I've now analysed and reanalysed for hours upon end to see it through this lense. Where once it was just a case of something not working out, a mutual decision to call it quits, in hindsight I see a woman actively cuckolding me. Another man must have been involved, and she must have been getting off on ditching me for him. And I don't know what to believe, I feel like this has broken me. I don't want this and I don't want it to be real but I just can't get it out of me. It's like I've been split into two seperate people fighting for control, and I'm losing. 

I always thought it originated from a girlfriend I had, a fairly long time ago now - she cheated on me and then left me for another guy, right under my nose and I felt like such an idiot an a loser afterward. That was before I was even aware that there was such thing as 'cuckolding'. But I can almost remember the exact moment that the pain of imagining - knowing that she was experiencing something as intimate as sex with another man - turned me on. That was the moment it all started and its been downhill from then. How I went from that to this I'm not even sure. A coping mechanism gone really, really wrong?

Now I think about it though, even from a young age my early sexual fantasies as a teenager involved some kind of sexual humiliation of some kind. Maybe she just triggered something deep inside of me and now I'm stuck with it.

Everything I've read says you can't get rid of a fetish, that they're usually to deeply routed and hardwired into is to just get rid of them. That you just have to accept it and learn to handle it - I can't do that, I can't live as being this sub-human not deserving of just normal affection or sex. Its me or it, I just can't do it. I have to get this out of my head or I think it might end me, its just getting stronger and stronger, its invading and taking over everything. If I have mutual attraction with a girl or something like that, I can't even flirt or go anywhere with that anymore, because I don't view it as two people attracted to each other or chemistry between us or sexual tension, I view it as her getting off on me not being good enough for her. 

I know its so so messed up and ridiculous, and no one can possibly see this as being more tragically pathetic than I do. But I hope someone can relate or just, point me in the direction of help or something because I don't know what to do anymore

I am a 24 year old/uncircumcised male and I am having unprotected sex with my female partner.
A couple of weeks ago, after sex, a few days later i noticed pain in the urethra that was relieved when I peed. It made me want to pee more frequently so I thought there was a potential chance of infection or STI. I went to my schools nurse practitioner and got negative results for Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, and UTI. She told me just to drink water and come back if the pain continues. Pain went away and I had sex again for a while until today where during doggystyle, I started noticing the same pain again (a lot sharper actually) and we had to stop. I notice the pain a lot when my penis moves around in my boxers and when I move my flaccid penis around, I can also feel this pain. Hurts the most when I point it up.

Am I somehow able to injure my urethra due to rough sex? I notice no inflammation or cut's inside the urethra. Can damage occur due to air entering the vagina and due to fast thrusts, somehow damage my urethra? I can't find anything online to help me other than the usual STI or UTI talk."

I'm now beginning to think that I may have cause scarification to the tissue on my dick, and as a result, haven't the confidence to date any longer and am throwing the towel in on anything to do with sex. It was a good run, but my stupidity cost me and now I have a brand new insecurity on top of ones that I already had about myself in general.

I was not introduced to sex in the correct way at all. When I was a kid, my ""almost"" step sibling used to blow me, rim me, attempt sex, etc. I was told by my step sibling to return these favors, which I tried once but refused to do them again. However, my ""almost step-sibling"" would often drop my pants and go at it just because he could.

Also, I had a big incident where I slept on the couch with an older girl who fondled me a bit, and an incident where a slightly older girl stripped for me and a friend of mine.

Plus my babysitters showing off their ass and cleavage, but never actually taking clothes off.

All these incidents happened when I was around 8-10.

I never received ""the talk""....I was just shown normal porn. This was around 12 I think. I also got into my step fathers email all the time which had hardcore porn that was sent from a friend. I viewed a LOT of that around this age.

Anyways, looking back I consider the first incident described abuse...at least in my eyes. I feel overall I was introduced to sex too early and too quickly and it had an impact.

I feel like this led me to try the peanut butter trick with a dog when I was around 13, which I regret all the time. My family used to constantly joke about it when I was younger and I think that led me to try it. This is my absolute darkest secret. This shit eats me up every day thinking about it.

Ive viewed porn (few times, never again after) where women were mounted by dogs. I got off to it a few times around age 13 I think. However, actual penetration to or from an animal or anything like that sickens me to think about.

My porn interests now are surprise sex, rimming, babysitters, and incest, though the thought of incest gags me when it comes to actual family.

The thing that gagged me out was that I have gotten off a few times to light shotacon incest. This is art that depicts minors, however I am NOT into the stuff that has characters that look like kids in it. The only art I have gotten off too had characters that all have full grown body features but were around the age of 16ish according to the dialogue. Usually the characters were involved in incest or a school teacher ""teaching"" sort of scenario.

Even then, I think the situation turned me on more than the characters, because I didnt notice until a few sessions later that it was even shotacon. I get off to the same type of situation with older actors just as well.

The actual shotacon art that does depict minors makes me uncomfortable to look at. I have also seen real CP back in my 4chan days, and one time on Vine when some accounts went out of control posting it. Any time I have seen it it makes me nauseated. I have no interest in minors whatsoever.

Anyways, this stuff has made a decent impact on me mentally. I love rimming but I connect it to a bad experience with a fucking animal now. I feel wrong that Ive gotten off to shotacon, though I feel like its barely even shotacon, plus actual minors or cartoon minors that are visibly underage turn me off.

To conclude...

1. I feel like I was introduced to sex at too young of an age and abused to some extent. That, plus never having ""the talk"" and just being shown porn, along with viewing it all the time, was too much at that age.

2. I tried the peanut butter trick and it is now my darkest secret that only I know and it eats me up. I watched porn a handful of times around 13 of women being mounted by dogs. It gags me to think Ive ever watched it, and bestiality is no turn on of mine.

3. It seems my fetishes (incest, ""teaching"" sex, babysitters, rimming, surprise sex) are connected to my past. I do not find incest attractive at all in the real world.


4. Ive viewed light shotacon (fully developed characters but around 14-16 according to dialogue. Usually incest related.) I feel like the situation was what turned me on, not the characters, since actual CP and actual shotacon make me sick to look at, and sex with minors is fucked up. It still makes me feel filthy mentally and physically though. Ive decided to lay off porn and curve my viewing habits after I got sick the last time I had a session.


5. I feel like taboo or something else plays a part in my current viewing habits. (rimming, anal, gangbangs, surprise sex, threesome, babysitter, incest). However, incest does not turn me on in the real world.

Basically, I just need advice or open ears. I feel like im some fucked up sex freak, and its played a part in why I have trouble finding relationships.

Thanks everyone for any help you have.

P.S. Therapy is not an option financially, and I dont really feel like I need it that badly. My family would also not respond well.

In my teenager years I never experienced blue balls, back then I PMO on a daily/weekly basis. But when I became 19years old, that's when I really started dating and having sexual pleasures with girls.. It's from that moment on that I began experiencing the real pain of blue balls (to the point it feels like someone kicked you right in your testicles). I'm 22 now (trying to avoid PMO, but still weekly) and still experience this when i'm with a girl and don't orgasm.. This makes it very hard to orgasm when the moment is there because of the pain i'm experiencing. I searched a lot on the internet on this matter but everyone is either using blue balls as a term for not having sex for a while or the ones that do understand the pain are saying you have to stop PMO and try to avoid being aroused, which is very hard when you are kissing and being touchyfeely with a pretty girl. So my question to you guys out there who are having/had the same problem; 


1)Is there a long term solution to blue balls? 

2)When in a long term relationship with a girl, will blue balls always be there or will it go away eventually? 

3)Will stopping to PMO help your testicles to adjust and better handle sexual teasing?

Two nights ago I began to have sexual intercourse with a girl but then I decided not to (that's a part of the story I really don't want to disclose). I WAS wearing a condom and took it off after being inside her for maybe 15 seconds max. Then I laid next to her and I fingered her for a while, and then I went to bed and in the morning she was gone. When I woke up, I noticed blood on the condom, and then I noticed that there was blood on my hand, but it was only around my index and middle finger knuckle area where my fingers connect to my hand. Tonight, two nights later, I am experiencing a chafe-like feeling in the corners between my thighs and my testicles. I shaved my pubic hairs last Thursday, and I hadn't for a few months prior, so I'm thinking maybe the chafing was the hairs that are growing back, because I did a lot of walking this weekend. However, in addition to this, I have used the bathroom today much more frequently than I have before, and haven't drank any more fluids than usual. I messaged this girl, and I asked her if she was clean because I assumed the bleeding was her being on her period or something and I wasn't sure, and she told me she is clean. Is it at all possible that this is an STI? And would it have showed up this early? It's been less than 48 hours since I was in physical contact with her. I don't think I'm experiencing any pain in my penis, and certainly none in my testicles. I think that any pain I think I feel in my penis is me psyching myself out after this, but I do have anxiety issues from time to time.

Thanks for any help in advance."

**TL;DR: I've had small white bumps on my penis since puberty. What kind of doctor should I see? What might they be?**

I've had patches of many small white bumps on the underside of my circumcised penis since around puberty, long before I was ever sexually active. I wash my genitals thoroughly so I believe that's not the issue.

I theorize that they're like acne, since 

* they look like whiteheads and can pop if I try 

* they're only on the underside of my penis, which has a lot of loose skin and sits against my scrotum, trapping sweat during the day

* they seem benign - they're not itchy or painful, but they *are* more sensitive than surrounding skin.

It's probably not fun for a girl to go down on (although they're not super noticeable when I'm erect) and if it's contagious I don't want to spread it.

So, my basic questions is: **which kind of doctor should I see? A general practitioner, a dermatologist, a urologist, or something else?**

My priority is seeing a doctor without having to explain to my parents what it's about, but if it's necessary the benefits of telling them are worth the awkwardness. If I can go to a general practitioner it'll be much easier since I can get an appointment through my university."

I honestly don't understand how this has happened. At first it was a big shock so I did cry a little and asked a few questions.

When we tried to take it further however we found that intercourse hurt her, like a lot. We didn't try again for a very long time and every time we've tried since the result is the same, it kills the mood entirely. We've tried using lubricants, and she's tried loosening up by herself but it always hurts.

So we've been limited in our sexual activity for a very long time and it's starting to cause issues. I can't say this in a way that doesn't make me sound like a sex-hungry asshole but I admit I hate how restricted our sex lives are.

I don't want to say my sex life is boring but I'd certainly like to do new things. Neither me or my SO have had sex before so I feel we've both been robbed of arguably one of the most special moments a couple can share.

Recently we brought it up again and it's causing friction between us. Anytime we discuss this I explain my viewpoint that we're both being deprived of the experience, but at the same time she's nervous about seeing a specialist who can provide diagnosis.

She also refuses to have any form of surgery even if it's the only solution. I understand why she's apprehensive but it affects us both, and I don't know how to move forward with the issue without sounding like a selfish guy trying to get some action.

I've been on and off birth control pills to treat my irregular bleeding. While my libido on the pill was normal, I stopped taking it for around 9 months now. 

The hormonal imbalance from PCOS has also led to anxiety. Partially from dealing with the side effects and also because I just didn't feel very ""sexy"". 

This has been difficult for my fiancé. We've been together for around five years and up until this year we've been having great sex. But this year since going off the pill, my body is still readjusting. So I haven't been in the mood.

To add to this, one night a female friend and I got drunk and her and I had sex. While I told my fiancé about this right away, she never told her boyfriend and pretends like it didn't happen. Needless to say, sex with her was not a good experience. I felt violated (she kept asking me to finger her and touch her breasts) and I was simply not attracted to her. 

Now with everything going on, i don't know how to get back to normal. Do I need to go back on birth control? Should I confront my friend? How do I (for lack of a better word) come back from this?


**Tl;dr** struggling with low libido after going off birth control pills. I also had sex with a female friend after getting drunk one night. It was a bad experience and added to the feelings I already had about being unsexy. Not sure what I can do to get back to normal and go back to enjoying sex with my boyfriend

Dating and navigating sexual health,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/7jb2io/help_me_out_here_dating_and_navigating_sexual/,shouty_caps,8,2017-12-12 06:32:25,12,/r/sex/comments/7jb2io/help_me_out_here_dating_and_navigating_sexual/,NaN,"Background: I [26/F] recently had a bad experience with Chlamydia that has made me seriously question the way I look at sex with casual encounters/dating.

I had slept with a guy who told me he was clean. After feeling anxious about having unprotected sex (even though I knew I was clean as I had been recently tested), I went ahead and retested for good measure. I tested positive. 

He was the only person who could have given me the STD. There was some initial panic at first, but hey, I took a pill and that was it— I was confident knowing that I was going to make a commitment to have protected sex from then on. 

But deep in the throes of late night WedMDing and scouring similar websites looking up ways to engage in safer practices, I started realizing just how risky even protected sex is. 
So here’s where my questions come in:

Let’s say you’re dating someone casually (or even you meet someone out) and sex comes up. You use a condom like a responsible adult. Great.

But what about oral sex? Are you supposed to refrain from engaging in that until you know if your partner has been tested and is clean? (as you can pass STDs orally.) Do people seriously use condoms and dental sex for oral sex? (not condescending-- a curious inquiry.)

More specifically with herpes: you can contract HSV-2 (genital herpes) if someone with HSV-1 goes down on you. About half the population has HSV-1 and apparently 1/6 of the population has genital herpes. Most people don’t know they have genital herpes because it’s asymptomatic. To make things more complicated, most clinics do not test for genital herpes with a general panel unless symptoms are present. So if you can’t be readily tested because you don’t have symptoms, how can you know if you’re safe or not?

For some perspective, I’ve been seeing this guy for several months and when I expressed that I wanted him to get tested before we had protected sex, he was at first, clearly frustrated. I hate that I feel like I’m punishing someone because I really want to have sex, too. “When’s the last time you’ve been tested?” is a serious buzzkill, but I see no other alternative to get that security.

While I want to believe people will be receptive, it seems like a big ask to have him (or anyone I have sex with) get tested and then seek out another lab that does a herpes test. 

Am I being paranoid or safe? Advice? Thanks!"

I don't do relationships. I 'hook up' with someone every once in a while. I have vaginismus, so the definition of 'hook up' is different for me, but I am not in a position yet to have a romantic relationship with anyone (bipolar, uncured vaginismus, study, etc.).

So because of my vaginismus, my sex life is quite limited. Usually we make out, have outercourse, have manual sex, etc. Naturally the guys that I hook up with also want their dicks sucked. Understandable, but I won't do it unless they have proof they're clean. They don't always do and will almost always whine afterwards or turn cold. Fine by me. Hook ups never eat me out either. Plenty of other fish in the water.

However, it almost seems like majority of men feel entitled to unsafe blowjobs while hooking up, while feeling like they're too good to eat unsafe pussy.  It's not uncommon for a guy slowly push my head towards his dick or to make getting him off a priority. It's very demeaning and kind of off putting. 

I'm bi, so I sleep with women too, but they usually are far more respectful of my boundries and concerns. Women usually accept or compromise on the issue of safe sex (bi women that is, lesbians are pratically all STD-free if they're GS). I'm a lot less anxious 'hooking up' with women than I am with men because of it.

Men however try to plead or act like you can't catch STD's sucking dick, but when I say: 'Fine, I'd like you to me out first and I'll blow you then.' the answer is usually something along the lines of 'I don't really like doing that, but pls suck this dick, I need you.'. 

It's starting to make me hate men and it's stalling my progress of curing my vaginismus.

Am I missing something? Am I being to much of a prude by wanting safe (oral) sex? Or by wanting to get eaten out before I put my health on the line for someone else's pleasure? Is there not a consensus that you can catch STD's while having oral sex? Please say so, if I'm overreacting."

One thing led to another and we ended the night in bed together.

 As soon as he got to my room I warned him that I didn't have any condoms and that we absolutely couldn't have sex without one. He went searching for one and when he couldn't find one he suggested we 'fool around' so a bit of everything but penetration. I stopped him from performing oral on me as i wasn't that comfortable with it. At one point in the encounter, in the heat of the moment, I let him penetrate me but not fully it for long, risky all the same.

A bit later we talked about our relationship history. He mentioned he had been tested since his break up and practising safe sex. I have been tested too since last partner BUT very recently, a month ago, i had a very bad experience in which I woke up unable to remember the night before with a guy telling me he had not used protection. I was very upset by what has happened and hadn't pushed myself to get tested as I was afraid of How To say what happened to me and circumstances, I had got the morning after pill from the pharmacy.

The man i was sleeping with immediately started to get angry and ask me why I hadn't told him. He woke me up the next day having phoned a clinic and asking me to get aids tested etc. I was so shocked by his reaction and the fact he blamed me quite heavily for putting him at risk. I felt terrible and apologised sincerely for NOt thinking and immediately got tested. When he asked me about the encounter he asked if I had been raped and I said I couldn't be sure and that I thought I might have been drugged, I was shocked by the encounter and had tried to block it from my memory. I felt terrible that I could have passed on something and to hurt someone else. He did not accept my apology and this made me feel even worse.

Upon reflection I realise that I should have said something at the beginning. I did start with the condom and got carried away with all the other things we were doing. I can't help but feel that if I were in his position I would take a bit Of The responsibility and I probably wouldn't have gotten angry but talked about getting tested, especially if the person was honest with me and sorry. 

I realise it might be unhealthy point of view but when I have put myself at risk in the past I have gotten tested and never thought to really blame the other person, knowing fully that having unprotected sex leaves me open to all their previous partners and that they more than likely have taken risks in the  past before me.

I hope to learn something from this but I feel terrible, and this guy won't answer my messages, he has judged me completely for this while before he had said was interested in getting to know me and hence why we had had such an honest conversation in the first place.

Who would you say is to blame? Would you blank a girl or a guy if you were in his position?"

I remembered how stressful getting emergency contraception was in high school and how me and my partner had no option but to take it in he park outside of our high school. If we had a safe, private space to purchase and take emergency contraception I can only imagine how less stressful the situation would be. 

Additionally, our campus sexual health center sells discounted sex toys and gives each undergraduate three dollars every term to use in their sex shop. I got my first butt plug for only 2 dollars out of pocket and that was instrumental in exploring my sexuality. these subsidized toys and sex cash allowed me to experiment with different lubes, vibrators, cock rings and other things I wouldn't normally go out of my way to buy. I feel like my sex life (both with partners and solo) is 300% better after exploring all these different options.

If your school doesn't have these resources I highly recommend reaching out to your administration and seeing if it is possible to set these up. I know they have been super important to me and my partners and I am so lucky to have such a supportive campus :)"

**You're posting this in a sex positive community\- isn't that going to make you have a pretty unrepresentative sample?** 

This is only one of the many, many places I'm positing this to make sure that my sample is balanced. We're aiming for a sample size of 5,000\-7,000 (which is why I would really appreciate your participation!), so this is being posted to tons of other social media sites, other subreddits, on blogs, sent out in emails to universities and sexual health clinics, and posters are being put up in as many places as possible. 

**I feel like some of the questions you asked here are a little vague, why did you make them like this?** 

I didn't! Part of research is ensuring the validity and reliability of your data\- we do this by using previously tested and validated measures, like for anxiety and depression. These measures are sometimes a little vague, but just answer them to the best of your abilities. This is common and an unavoidable drawback of research in every subject. If the questions seem odd, trust me, they're there for a reason!

Yes, I would love that! Feel free to share this with anyone\- the more participants, the better. "

Don't worry- I'm plastering this survey in as many places as possible- this is just one of the few places it's going. I've been putting up flyers, putting it on craigstlist, facebook, research pages, university web pages, twitter, etc. in order to get the most diverse sample as possible. Of course, people who choose to participate in sex research will always be a little different from people who choose not to, but there's a bunch of statistics stuff I can do to minimise this bias. I've also been mostly avoiding putting it on websites like fetlife because I don't want it to skew too heavily in that direction. I'll be doing a kink-specific study next year, and that's when I'll be using those sites more. 

*Can I see the results?*

Yes, of course! All the subreddits I'm putting this on will get an update with the results. You can also email me (my email is on the first page of the link) and send me your contact info if you wish. Fair warning though- it may take awhile. I'm going to be doing some very in-depth, advanced statistical analyses on all of this, and that takes time. However, I'll try to come back with general and preliminary results sooner. Yay for math! Yay for science!

*Some of the questions seem weird and I don't know how to answer them- help?*

Here's the deal with research: In order to make our numbers and analyses valid, we have to use measures (like for anxiety and depression) that have already been created and mathematically tested by other researchers. The majority of first part of this survey was created by your truly, but the rest is a compilation of these other measures that have already been, as we call it, 'psychometrically validated'. We can't change the questions or response formats for these! Some questions might seem odd or you may be fluctuating between two different answers, but I promise they're made like that for a reason- just do the best you can!

 I respect reddit rules and didn't want to post this before I was mature enough   
 

I think I have a issue with my sex organ as a male, when I'm erect I grow in length from around 10cm to 16.5cm and it gets thick rapidly in a way that I'm worried might be a medical issue 11cm to 20.3cm when measuring around, it gets from me being able to masturbate and wrap my arm around my penis to not being able to do that in about 5 seconds.  
 

My friend also shoots cum out and for me it just drools out, though when we compared the amount I have much more coming out then what he shoots, we compared it with a syringe and he filled it about 3-5ml while I filled 12-16ml is it an issue or related to the above?  
 

Another question I had is for my partner/girlfriend we have been friends since childhood and in the past year started to get emotional to each other, she is 5 months younger than me though our parents know we are in love and kissed when we both where 16 and 17.  
 

The issue is she is 17 and I'm 18, though she started to get interested in me sexually now, I discovered it when we were making out and she pulled out a condom asking me if I want to have fun.  
 

I'm stressed about it since she is at that problematic age and we didn't have this problem when I was 17, and it frustrates her. I'm also worried what she might say if she sees my sex.  
 

I don't know what to do and would love help on all these subjects, I feel very confused about my sex life/relationship"

You may have seen this on here before, but recruitment is ending in a few weeks and I'm trying to boost recruitment. Please take part if you haven't already!

## [https://kcliop.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_bqPC8kIIc7NOvLD?Q\_CHL=social&amp;Q\_SocialSource=reddit](https://kcliop.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bqPC8kIIc7NOvLD?Q_CHL=social&amp;Q_SocialSource=reddit)

I'm currently conducting a large population research study on atypical sexual interests and mental health outcomes. I'm an experimental psychology PhD candidate (and sex researcher) at King's College London. **My goal is to create a study that is all inclusive of people of different gender identities, sexual orientations, age, and backgrounds.** This study takes about 30 minutes to complete, but I have it set up so you can come back and finish it within a week of starting it- just use the same device as you did when you began taking it. This involves answer questions about your sexual fantasies, behavior, mental health, personality, and demographic info. All responses are anonymous and we're not collecting any identifiable info. I need you to help make this research as strong as possible! **You need to be 18+ and live in the US, UK, Canada, or Ireland to take this.** 

*A few questions I've seen the past few times I've posted this:*

**You're posting this in a sex positive community- isn't that going to make you have a pretty unrepresentative sample?** 

This is only one of the many, many places I'm positing this to make sure that my sample is balanced. We're aiming for a sample size of 5,000-7,000 (which is why I would really appreciate your participation!), so this is being posted to tons of other social media sites, other subreddits, on blogs, sent out in emails to universities and sexual health clinics, and posters are being put up in as many places as possible. 

**I feel like some of the questions you asked here are a little vague, why did you make them like this?** 

I didn't! Part of research is ensuring the validity and reliability of your data- we do this by using previously tested and validated measures, like for anxiety and depression. These measures are sometimes a little vague, but just answer them to the best of your abilities. This is common and an unavoidable drawback of research in every subject. If the questions seem odd, trust me, they're there for a reason! If you have issues with later parts of the survey, it's probably not something I can address- they were created by other researchers and I can't touch them!

**Can I share this with other people?**

Yes, I would love that! Feel free to share this with anyone- the more participants, the better. 

**Will you show us the results?** 

Yes! However, it may take awhile. This is a very large sample that I'll be doing quite a bit of data analysis with, and it's going to break down into multiple publications. I can come back and give preliminary results when I have them, but if you want the full results, please email me ([sara.brown@kcl.ac.uk](mailto:sara.brown@kcl.ac.uk)) and I'll put you on a spreadsheet as someone who will receive copies of the publications when I have them!

So, I feel the need to preface this by giving some background information. I am a 26 year old male with a highly laborious job working, on average, 60 hour work weeks. I have been in a stable relationship for 7 years in March, and I proposed in April of this year. I've been on Adderall for about 5 years now, and have been working with my doctor to establish lower dosages in attempts to wean myself off. My fiance and I have a healthy sex life, and aside from a 2 year rough patch (when I was pretty bad off on Addy, working night shift at the same job I have now, not sleeping for 2 days straight), it always has been. We typically have sex at least once a week, which I feel is a typical amount considering we both work ridiculous hours and typically only have 1 day off a week together. 

The question I have pertains more to me than to her. Is it ""normal"" (for lack of a better word) to stay extremely horny for a few days to a few weeks on end, even with a pretty much daily ""release"" either from myself or with her assistance? My sex drive has steadily increased as my dosage decreased, which I expected since it decreased as my dosage went up. But now, I take 5 mg IR tablets 4 times daily (started on 30 mg XR and 10 mg IR once daily, then dropped to 25/10, then 25/5, 20/5, 15/5, to current dosage), and I get so horny on a daily basis that if I don't cum before bed, I wake up with blue balls and I'm in a terrible mood the entirety of the next day (or until I do cum). 

Even during the peak of my sexual activities in prior years, I have never had this severity nor frequency of ""issues"" in my life. 

I don't particularly feel that this alone is cause for concern, but I feel that left untended (for lack of a better word), it could either develop into something more serious such as a porn addiction, or could  cause a rift in our relationship if the sexual activities become  too infrequent (from my perspective) or frequent (from hers). I don't feel that infidelity would ever be a concern, just the rift leading to arguements or resentment, neither of which I care to add to our otherwise healthy, happy life together.

I greatly appreciate any and all input this community may have, and look forward to being a new member of the Reddit community."

So yeah I'm an 18 year old guy, still a virgin, and  since ai was like 14 I  thought I had phimosis. My dad was a circumcised and I wasn't so i don't think he ever really knew about having to care for an uncircumcised penis and so he never really told me anything about it. Basically, long story short: I've never pulled down my foreskin as I thought I wasn't able to and thus I've also never properly washed my penis.

About a half an hour ago, I decided to just pull down on it as far as I could whilst I washed it and the whole foreskin went back behind my bellend for the first time. However it doesn't go back like it should and to get it down I have to like roll the foreskin pretty slowly back and there's a huge ring wof foreskin that's just peeled back at my bellend when I pull it down.

So basically, I want to know: 
1. Do I have phimosis?
2. Does my penis look relatively clean or is it like badly infected or some shit
3. Why is my foreskin not rolling back properly
4. Are uncut guys supposed to be able to pull the foreskin all the way down to the bottom pf the shaft because I can only go as far as the bellend.

I've tried Tinder and Bumble, meeting people at bars and parties, but I can't for the life of me clearly initiate a physical connection. The longer I go, the more my confidence plummets. Its come to point where I've started having occasional ""forever alone"" panic attacks, shaking sweats and all.

# Your Complete Sexual Fulfillment Could Be Only Three Steps Away! 

**Fairbanks, Alaska (PRWEB) October 15, 2018** 

[**Enviromax**](http://www.sexualhealthworld.com/) **presents a new Sexual Health Pyramid for Prostate Cradle customers and people everywhere to learn how to improve physical health, sexual health, and spiritual health!**     


**The sexual health pyramid is designed to help people achieve higher levels of fulfillment in their lives. There is more to sexual health than having great sex. In order to experience great orgasms, it helps to begin with creating a foundation of a well balanced life.**      


**Imagine a simple pyramid diagram with three levels:** **Physical health is the base level, and the foundation for sexual health, because physical health is commonly known as “the greatest wealth.” When we take care of our body, good health shines into every aspect of our lives, including sexual health.**      


**Sexual health is the heart of the pyramid, balanced between physical and spiritual health. Learning how to achieve timeless male multiple orgasms, expanded, and “Full-body Super Orgasms” can be a life-changing experience for both men and women. There is a new sexual health forum and a lot of information about how to have super orgasms at the website: HeartCenteredSexualHealth.com**     


**Spiritual health / Transcendence is the essential keystone on top of the pyramid, because without a higher connection, sex can become meaningless and boring. Non-sexual events which happen throughout the day can have a huge effect on the quality of your sex life. Social relationships are one of the most important factors related to overall fulfillment. Therefore, offering up a bit of kindness and generosity can help to heighten your own feelings of happiness, strengthen close relationships, and improve your love life.**

* cannot have bowel movements without embarassingly putting my thumb all the way in my vagina and pressing down (either that or straining) almost every single time. sometimes it's easier and I don't have to do this
* bottom of vaginal canal seems very loose and the texture has changed (I suspect this is due to rectocele)

I'm very depressed by these issues and afraid that I'll never be able to practice anal sex the way I wanted to. I never even got the chance and it seemed like such an exciting thing to do. And on top of that, I cannot even put my fingers or toys inside my vagina anymore without pain on the sides and feeling... self conscious about the looseness of the bottom of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to do kegels but i'm so weak and I'm not even sure I'm flexing the right muscles. I want to repair this issue without surgery but I'm so afraid that I will fail and the first time I meet with my long distance partner, he's going to feel shit inside me through my vagina and be grossed out..or notice the looseness of the bottom of it and comment on it. 

  
I've never had a kid, never really ""strained"" while I had a bowel movement, so I'm really... really not sure why the fuck I'm having a rectocele if I've \*never\* had problems with bowel movements or had a kid..

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys think you can give advice?? Do you think anal will ever be possible for me? Or do you think I could ""heal"" my weak pelvic muscles... I'm so young and it makes me feel broken and disgusting to have to literally thumb the shit out of myself and feel like the most fun parts of me are broken and gross.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of it, the skin around my clitoral hood has gotten... fatter? SO I can barely even masturbate anymore without pressing hard against the excess skin. I used to be able to just press on the hood and i'd be okay but now I'm so desensitized and I have to really jack it up to orgasm which makes me feel bad because I've always preferred gentle sex and I feel like now I won't be able to get off via oral"

General question about sexual health. 

I’ve been seeing this girl for a little bit now and it’s been great, we’ve been safe and using a condom but we’re thinking of taking it off soon.  

We’re pretty active and open about how many people we’ve slept with but she mentioned that probably the last 7 or 8 guys were without a condom so she’ll get checked before we start to do that. 

I’ve also been tested clean but I know the tests included things like the urine sample (chlamydia and gonorrhoea) and a blood test (syphilis and HIV). 

With this in mind I was unsure on whether Herpes / HPV is being tested here, I remember once I had to specifically ask for a check to see if I had HPV strain which caused warts (turns out ingrown hair lol). 

As a general question, if her results come back clean are we good to go from a sexual health standpoint for vaginal and anal sex? 

Thanks in advance "

It's been a few months and I'm slowly getting better. I was feeling depressed and anxious (pre-existing before my girlfriend) so I went to see a shrink she prescribed me with an ssri and a benzo. Although it helped a little at first it completely killed my libido. I told my shrink that and now I'm off the medication. The only thing is I can't get my libido back. Even with Viagra I can get hard but only watching porn and even then it's weak and not not like it was before. 

I've started dating and it's becoming a very shameful issue because I get to the bedroom and I want to have sex and there is a desire to but I just can't get hard. I don't know how to fix it and it's making everything worse. 

I used to suffer pretty bad from performance anxiety. It's driving me insane because I'm young and in good shape. I feel like I am missing out on so much life experience. 

My question to the people of Reddit is what can I do? How do I get my old libido back and how do I become someone who can just have a one night stand? How do I become more sexually confident? (When I am with a partner I know I feel good about myself and I've been told good things by numerous partners - so it's not a case of me thinking I'm bad at sex) "

Please read it all as there is a lot of important context. Thank you so much for any help in advance!

I have some pretty weird stuff going on with my vagina and body. First, let me give the background info that I am a morbidly obese woman, age 25, who was diagnosed with PCOS at age 13. I've had irregular periods most of my life. Other than that though, my vaginal health seemed fine until a couple years ago when I had a few bad yeast infections from taking antibiotics. Maybe this other stuff was there to a degree before that and I didn't notice but I'm not sure.

Anyway, after clearing the yeast infections, I felt fine. The only issue was that I always had a white discharge constantly and my ex would always point out how I had this cottage cheese look around my labia and clit. We noticed some very small bumps along the labia where that was as well. I cleaned super well each time I showered and it was very hard to clear it off. That was the start of my troubles.

Those issues stayed the same and persisted for a while and then one day, seemingly out of the blue, I had extreme stomach cramps and lower back pain and the heaviest 'period' I'd ever had in my life. I was crying a lot from the pain and it was so bad that I had to wear an adult diaper for a few days. There were some really big clots and I thought that maybe I was having a miscarriage. It lasted just around 4-5 days I believe and then I was okay. Fast forward to about 8 months later, I had another event similar to that one except accompanied by a lot less pain and blood this time. It was still heavy and I had the biggest clot I've ever seen come out of me. I want to say it was about this time that I started having more constant issues with my vagina.

Since that time about 4 months ago, I started experiencing light bleeding when I masturbated or after having sex. This was never an issue before. There was typically no pain when having sex or masturbating, but afterwards I would feel and do still feel achy. I would describe how I feel after as being similar to starting your period. I feel a bit achy in my stomach and lower back, sometimes my vagina area itself is sore and achy, I feel bloated often times after, and my current boyfriend thinks it even affects my mood after I masturbate. It's very weird. The bleeding is usually pretty light. There's usually some clotting and the color of the blood seems to vary. The bleeding sometimes goes away super fast but usually it's like I'm spotting for a few days after.

I went to the gynecologist at planned parenthood a few months ago. She said I had bacterial vaginosis. She didn't seem to be concerned about it being anything else. She prescribed me flagyl which I took for only 2 or 3 days because it made me miserable... I felt like I had the worst flu ever. It didn't seem to clear up my issues any what bit I did take of it but I doubt I was on it long enough for it to make a difference anyway. I should've called them and got a different prescription at the time but I tend to have bad side effects and always hate taking new medicine because of it so since I'd just had that awful experience I think I was just over it for the moment.

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago. I went back to planned parenthood. I swabbed myself to check for bacterial vaginosis and they tested me for gonorrhea and chlamydia. I kind of wish I'd had him actually look at me and do a pelvic exam but I was uncomfortable with it being a guy so they let me swab myself and then talk to him after. He said I had a few clue cells show up and that he thought I just had a mild case of bacterial vaginosis. He also said he had no reason to think I had gonorrhea or chlamydia and they never called me about the results so I'm assuming that I'm clear on those. I asked him about the bleeding and his response to that was that it's very common for women to bleed after sex because of the contractions in the uterus and said something about semen playing a role in it as well. I didn't feel very confident in my visit with him. I said to him how isn't it weird that the bleeding has become more &amp; more often &amp; that I never used to have this issue... he said it was pretty normal &amp; he just thinks it's a small infection.

He prescribed me Metrogel. I didn't realize until later that Metrogel is the same as Flagyl and it's also super expensive. I called today to see if they can change out the medication for something different and cheaper. Anyway, my concern is that it's not just bacterial vaginosis. I was worried about there being an abscess or polyps but he assured me that the female gyno who gave me the exam a couple months back would have detected that. I just feel like I'm very unwell in a way. My breasts also bother me sometimes. They can be very sore and my boyfriend and my ex both have said that they've seen my nipple bleed (right breast only). Sometimes I feel like this slightly wet sensation when I'm wearing just a shirt and no bra. I doubt it's related to the vaginal stuff but I thought I'd throw it in there. Lol

Oh, and more recently, my clit has been more sore and I've experienced swelling down there after I masturbate. If I don't have sex or masturbate for a bit then it feels fine. It makes me want to just never masturbate because I know I'm just going to experience aches and bleeding and swelling. I also itch a little sometimes but it's noooothing like when I had yeast infections. It's not severe or too often. But yeah, always looks red down there and creamy discharge, the cottage cheese stuff, and the bleeding happens every single time I masturbate now.

I'm not on any medication at the moment, waiting on them to call me back with a new prescription, but I do want to take birth control possibly but my boyfriend is a bit nervous for me to take it with everything that's been going on. I'm always nervous to take something new so I'm just not sure what action to take in that regard. 

If you have any ideas as to what may be going on, I'd love to hear it. Does it sound like actually just a case of bacterial vaginosis? Or do you think there's something else going on?

Thanks so much."

Let me walk you through my whole history. I used to be really attractive and good looking 4-5 years ago and before that. 
I am straight and always have been. But like I said, I do enjoy exploring myself and having sex be it with a guy. There was a friend of mine who I had sex with the first time in summer of 2012. He brought a tablet for that session and we went on for about an hour; our roles being versatile. Both were half hour on top. My health took a bit of turn from then and I got a little bit weak. But nothing really serious. 
Then again, we had sex in the last week of Sept, 13. He stayed the night. That night, he brought a different tablet and only I did him that night and in the end I went a bit rough and released inside him. My overall health took a heavy toll from that day. My overall body swelled in days. I started looking a bit skinny fat and my sexual health had a sudden downfall. Girls used to stare at me before this event and after it, my sex appeal, sexual health, my body, everything changed. I got depressed and used to stay at home and kept skipping college. My cheeks also swelled and the dark circles below my eyes increased. Overall body structure changed alot and for the worst. I started blaming my friend and his tablet for my condition. I stopped talking to him. Ever since then, my sexual health is on a continual downfall. I started feeling better a few months after that event but my health and body structure never went to the same way it was. I also had a few sessions after that but it was okay. I recovered in a month from that. My health became good in 2017 (not even remotely as good as it used to be back in the glory days, but was good) but then an event happened. 
In summers of 17', I was alone in Marriot after my job hours and idk what gotten into me. I used the body lotion of the hotel to masturbate. What I did was that when I was about to ejaculate, I stopped. Then again went on, and again stopped. Did this for 15-20 minutes and then released. After the session, if felt like my penis went numb and shrunk. I regretted so much that I burst into tears about what damage I had done. I went to multiple doctors and also herbal healers but nothing seemed to work. Still to this day, I have shrunken penis and I believe I am impotent. When I masturbate, I ejaculate only after a few seconds. I am in so much stress and depression, I cannot even begin to explain it to you.
Then, in December last month, I used a toy (dildo) to play with myself. Ever since after that session, I can feel my ass swelled and gotten bigger (being a guy, it is not normal). Whenever I clench it, I can hear crackling sound. Also, the mass on my legs, thighs, hips have been swelled and increased (I hope you understand what I mean). I did measurement of my body and legs thighs hips were increased by around 3+ inches. I used to have a tight ass and moderate legs. I think the anal play messed up the lower body in ways I don't understand and also cannot discuss with a doctor.
I have never told any of this to anyone. 
But I felt really comfortable telling all of this to you. 
I wish you could just imagine the mental and physical stress that I am in and have been for quite a while now. 
I cannot masturbate because of my condition. It gets worse every time I do it. My skin becomes weird and loose. My body gets stressed. It takes forever to recover from one session. 
I cannot enjoy with my body with fear of what happened the last time I used a toy. I also used it again last month to see what happens and the ass and legs swelled and increased by size even more and it feels saggy and open.
I thought it was temporary and would recover but it didn't. Almost 4 months went by and I'm still there. The next session ruined the condition even more.
I am really desperate to get my health sorted out. Health is the most important thing to live a good life. I cannot even enjoy a good session of sex or self play. 

I really, really hope that there would be a solution out there for my condition."

I’m just not willing to dump either of them. They are both really sweet guys but also so different sexually. One have the perfect penis, my god it’s literally perfect and he’s such a good lover. His stamina is insane. And the other guy is smaller but sooo much more adventurous! We play with toys, have sex all over his apartment, he’s bicurious and we’ve had threesomes with guys and girls. He’s so open minded, when I am headed to his apartment I feel like a kid going to Disneyland! Between both guys I feel completely satisfied... actually more than satisfied, I feel like the LUCKIEST girl ever! They are really good guys and like my best friends

The adventurous guys knows about the other guy. We use condoms everytime, especially because we have threesomes and I also want to allow him the privacy have being able to sleep with other girls(guys) without needing to tell if he doesn’t want to. But the OTHER guy I’m not using condoms with because he insists against it and says he doesn’t want to sleep with any other girls but me. I tell him that we aren’t in a relationship and he says he understands that but... I don’t think he fully realizes I have another lover... or more that he doesn’t want to know. He very carefully never asks what I do when we didn’t hang out. He doesn’t dare look at my phone when it rings. He clearly understands I MAY seeing people occasionally but I don’t think he realizes I am seeing a specific person for the last year. 

I’m not sure if I should feel bad in the situation. I’m single. BUT should I be disclosing the particulars of my sex with others to my casual sex partners? Should I tell the guy I use condoms with that I don’t use condoms with my other partner? Should I tell the guy I don’t use condoms with that I have sex with another guy but we always use condoms? Or is this too much information that they don’t care to know and don’t need to know?

Right so a couple ago years now I was prescribed fluoxitine in the beginning I didn't really know if things where making any difference to my mental health. 

Fast forward and I had been taking them going on 7 months. I met this girl and she ended up in my bed. We had sex for 2 hours and after she mad multiple orgasms and could barely stand I still wasn't even close and she tried everything on me but  I could barely even stay hard let alone cum. She told me it was the best sex she ever had. 

(She did blow me the next morning and I cum after 20 or so minutes)

This happened a few more times with different women as well. 

Fast forward again to just over a year on meds and I started to not feel like myself. Like they where altering my emotions to the point I felt like I was acting ""fake"" 

So I chose to stop taking them. (Without telling the doctor, just stopped cold turkey)

Since then I've been a two pump chump basically. And if there's external stimulation like watching porn or watching a woman Doing whatever to me. I can't control it and immediately cum. 

So for both. Mental health (as I've been on a downward spiral for a while now) 
And to improve my sex life. I'm thinking of talking to my doctor and getting back on them. 

So what do you think.  Bare in mind I'm not taking them just for the sake of lasting longer in bed, however I know that's a factor which is a plus in my mind. 

As a side note I'm not that bothered about not being able to cum. I get the majority of my satisfaction from pleasing my partner. I'll more then happily jerk of later you know."

Today I discovered that apparently in China, there is no formal health class in high school, which I find quite shocking.

Suddenly it all made sense, things like the fact that she doesn't know how to make a meal plan, can't read food labels, not understanding food safety like the problem of leaving refrigerated food out overnight etc.  

I also discovered she has absolutely no education on sexual health, including how menstrual cycles work, the growth stages of a preborn child etc.  She is otherwise quite liberal (an INFP) but when it comes to abortion, she maintains that it's a baby the moment sperm meets the egg, which is a pretty hardcore conservative opinion and otherwise inconsistent with her character, and can only assume that she learned it from her mother.  

I'd like to help her learn this without forcing it on her.

MFF we all plan to be involved and sexual with each other including penetrative and oral sex. 

Emotionally and mentally we are as prepared as we all can be. We have had many discussions and talked about boundaries and desires. I think we have handled this part really well and we all feel ready and excited.

The only issue is the logistics of condom usage. My partner and I dont use condoms because she is on birth control. I obviously will wear a condom for our friend who will be joining us, as a safety and boundary issue. But that only protects me right? If I go back and forth between the two of them I would be essentially transferring any potential STIs to my partner? We are all clean and healthy as far as we know but that's not the point.

So logistically how do I handle this. Do I take off the condom everytime I go back to my partner and then put a new condom on when I switch?"

For about 2-3 months now, sexual penetration has been really tough for my girlfriend. If she doesn’t have an orgasm prior to penetration then she can last with minimal pain up until she achieves orgasm, in which case thrusting starts hurting and she reaches a point where she can’t continue. If she achieves orgasm *prior to penetration* however, then I can’t even enter without it hurting too much. 

We’ve taken a few different approaches of how to stop it. The one that worked the most was switching lube to a “überlube” which worked well for a little while, but we keep reaching the issue of pain even after applying extra lube. 

This past weekend we got over confident and thought the lube would do the job, and as I was finishing, she was in terrible pain and started crying after.

I don’t want to hurt my girlfriend anymore and it’s killing me to see her in pain. I also want to preserve our sexual happiness too. Does anyone have answers that might help this issue?

ca23am,How to shut down invasive questions and comments regarding female sexual health/family planning...from Dad?,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/ca23am/how_to_shut_down_invasive_questions_and_comments/,SalmonofWisdom123,0,2019-07-06 19:50:19,2,/r/sex/comments/ca23am/how_to_shut_down_invasive_questions_and_comments/,NaN,"Sorry for the long post, TLDR at bottom.  


I (28, married, F) fall into the camp of: unless you're my doctor or my partner, I feel uncomfortable with comments/questions about my sexual health or my plans to have kids. Generally, shutting down friends/acquaintances who ask is simple: I generally say, I don't like to discuss my health and then I change the subject to something innocuous. (Likewise, I make a practice of not asking others, and if someone chooses to share, I respond empathetically).

&amp;#x200B;

Lately (apparently for the past year), my dad has been making a lot of encouraging comments to my mom regarding me having a kid. This came to a head recently when I was in the hospital for a **week**, admitted with sepsis (and the world's worst migraine/low-pressure headache which made me unable to sit up for more than 3 minutes without feeling faint/vomiting for that week as well) and I was pretty quickly put on an antibiotic drip. My dad says happily to my mom: Oh maybe she's pregnant! (Obviously, when I was admitted a blood test determined I wasn't pregnant, and IMO Sepsis is a bit different than early pregnancy sickness.) And, when I couldn't sit/stand up for any reasonable amount of time, I obviously had bigger worries (ex. will I be able to sit at my office desk again? Will I be able to sit up and watch a movie? Will I be able to take a walk?) and the whole pregnant hope was deeply disappointing to me as it showed an absence of emotional intelligence from my father.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, there are a few things going on that I'm happier to disclose to my mom (particularly to the ""maybe she's pregnant"" hope, like: I know I'm not pregnant because my cycle is so regular you could set your watch to it...and I had it the week before getting hospitalized, or the jokes, ""well we sure enjoy practicing haha...but we really want to focus on our careers right now."" Or, ""You know we still live in a 1 BR, right? A baby?! Where would we even put it?!"" Additionally, we're not sure if we even want a kid (and feel like if we waffle on the question it is definitely **not** the time to have a kid), and would like to save more before making the decision once and for all in my mid-30s anyway (we'd like to be able to, oh you know, pay for the kid's college education...not to mention the 18 years of costs leading up to that!).

&amp;#x200B;

I have other examples of my dad demanding/indignantly asking about other female family member's childbearing plans/surgeries done at Women's hospitals/etc...as if he is entitled to the information.   


But, WHY SHOULD ANY OF US DISCUSS OUR SEX LIVES/SEXUAL HEALTH WITH MY DAD??? Neither of his kids have a great relationship with him, so it's not like we share a whole lot of other information to begin with. I feel like our (husband &amp; I) decision-making process as a couple is being put under a microscope, and I feel this is unfair because we shouldn't have to come up with endless reasons why we just would like to wait to make a decision. His demands for information/continued interest in this topic are creepy! Gross! Reek of entitlement! It's driving me nuts, makes me feel like he sees me as someone who exists for the sole purpose of popping out babies (I have a career! I have hobbies! I am a fully-formed, multi-dimensional person! -- And you should know that, *dad.*) 

&amp;#x200B;

**I need your help, redditors of r/ sex: how do I articulately and quickly shut down the hints/comments/hopes/questions (some casual, some demanding) regarding plans for children/health information pertaining to my uterus from my dad?** He would ask me directly a few years ago, to which I told him I hadn't made a decision and also didn't really want to discuss the topic with him. But he is now asking for this information through my mom. I'm more emotional when communicating verbally and I want to avoid going on the defensive, or screaming: *You're my parent* ***but*** *I'm an independent adult quit asking about my eggs and my husband's sperm you nosy fuckin' yenta!*

&amp;#x200B;

I've considered sending him a book of essays about why other people decided not to have a kid, but I'm afraid he might interpret this as opening the issue for further discussion. He's also Catholic (which may play into this) so I also need to get my point across without being too philosophical/religious. (I don't practice, and separately he's been pushing me (through my mom) to attend mass...but that's another story for another subreddit). Alternatively, if there are dads out there, would you/have you acted this way towards your daughter? Is this normal? Is it normal for daughters to share this information with their dads? Like, what is up with this?

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** My dad asks sometimes casual/sometimes indignant and demanding questions about when I'm going to have a kid/information about my uterine health, even though I told him years ago I didn't want to discuss. He also does this to other female family members of childbearing age (who are not volunteering information). What can I say that's short and sweet that will get the following points across:  
\-Why I am uncomfortable with this behavior (especially trying to get the info through my mom???)  
\-That other women might also be uncomfortable with this behavior.  
\-That we don't even speak regularly, so asking for that information is not really respectful of boundaries.  
\-That even if we did speak regularly, Why no one owes him this information, so he should stop demanding it/acting entitled to it."

During my early 20s I had morning wood everyday, random boners where my dick would get rock hard and just stay erect forever. Boners used to be triggered by the littlest things, jerking off everyday, i could jerk off 2 times in a day and still get rock hard after. 

Id say a little bit after I turned 23 is when I started losing it. This past year has been really bad. No more morning wood, no more random boners, other then a 2 week no fap I haven't been able to fully erect. Here's the thing, I'm able to get hard if I start wanking it to porn but it wont grow to full size and takes forever. It doesnt feel as good and  I have to be going at it hard af for a very long time just to cum. Feels very desensitized. Even when I reach the point of climax it gets hard and erect but not all the way. I could be at the beach with a bunch of hot girls running around in bikinis and while it gets my tingling and kind of in the mood I cant pop a boner. 

Funny thing is I last waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay longer during sex lmao and while I get compliments on my stamina, its not as good as it sounds. My dick wont get fully hard and it doesnt feel as pleasurable and I dont have that raw animalistic sexual desire anymore lol its like im doing it out of boredom and have to force my dick to get going. It sucks, I could be getting head for an hour and itll be hard the whole time but its just not the same lol.

So a little background I have had depression and anxiety since high school and its only gotten worse and worse. I have a big lack of interest in life in general, no social life and just feel miserable all the time, could this be affecting my libido?

I've tried doing things like Prolonging my masturbation sessions. I even took a break for approximately 14 days.  But I've only experienced slightly more pleasure, if that. I am not sure why. I am aware of the nofap community. Which of the best of my knowledge, a lot of the things that they are claiming have not yet been corroborated by medical scientific evidence. And I am feeling too stressed because I feel as though masturbation it's supposed to be fun, and there's no point in doing it if you are not receiving sexual pleasure from doing it. I might have to share some information about my own genitalia. And my own masturbation habits.  I have an uncircumcised penis.  I masturbate, by pulling back my foreskin, and then using my thumb and forefinger and then sliding the foreskin up and down, without touching the head of my penis, and doing that repeatedly until I reach orgasm and ejaculate. When I first started masturbating at the age of 13, I would do a slightly differently where I would massage the part of my inner foreskin that was to the left of my frenulum. That kind of resulted in a caliph that I can still feel if I am sort of messing with my inner foreskin. I don't masterbate the typical way that the overwhelming majority of people with penises do. We're simply consists of surrounding the penis in your hand, and they moving up and down and up and down and up and down until orgasm and ejaculation is achieved. I've heard some stuff about the prone masturbation and traumatic masturbatory vacation syndrome. I've also heard of death grip masturbation. But to the best of my knowledge, medical scientific evidence does not support the existence of those conditions. There was one study about prone masturbation. But those findings have not been corroborated by any other studies, so it's hard to really accept the conclusions as fact. I have tried masturbating the normal way. But I don't really like it. One reason is that I'm not really used to it. Another reason is that it results in me getting semen on my hands when I do reach orgasm and ejaculate. And even though we did feel better than my normal way of masturbating, it was only marginally better. And I feel upset and I'm not sure what to do. I can't go to a urologist or a sex therapist simply because I don't have any health care insurance coverage anymore. I lost my Obamacare subsidy because they said that they never received documents from me that verified my income, even though I'm sure that I did send them. While I have filed an appeal, and I do have plans to apply for a special type of Medicaid Program for people in my County, both of those may take a long time, and if I can reapply for ObamaCare once the new open enrollment. Starts up again, I still want to be able to get any coverage until any new plan that I end up purchasing goes into effect on January 1st 2020. So right now, online resources such as this forum is really the only thing that I have.

I guess the questions that I do have are as follows. Is there anything wrong with my masturbation method? Why do I not feel pleasure anymore? Is it possible that I have done it too much over the years ever since I started at the age of 13, and I am now 28. Is it possible that I injured myself? Is it possible that my physical health and mental health may be the cause of my declining sexual pleasure? Are there any other possible factors that I am not yet aware of? Will taking a break make a difference in how much sexual pleasure I feel, and if so how long of a break should I take? Is there any sort of scientific evidence that can help me?"

I'm sexually frustrated to the point that it's literally the only thing I can think about. It's affecting my mental health and I feel like a creep being horny almost every day at all times. In the past I would usually feel like this just for a few days around ovulation, but recently it's been going on for weeks without breaks and I'm starting to feel pathetic.

It doesn't help that I'm socially anxious, so even when I try to look on tinder and such, I get overwhelmed and scared very easily. I find myself swiping left on people I find attractive because I kept thinking that (given that we matched) they would find me boring, we would have nothing to talk about or they would want to meet right away or something else I'm not comfortable with

I'm not really into the idea of a romantic relationship but I couldn't just have a one night stand either. FWB sounds perfect, but I feel like it's much harder to find someone suitable for that than someone for just one night. I had something long distance going for a while but sadly it ended and ever since then it's been contributing to how miserable I feel now. I have no one to vent my frustration anymore, no one to discuss my desires, even just roleplay for a while, whatever. Now I have to keep it all to myself and I really can't cope 


Another thing is that I'm reaaally into older guys. Much older, like 40+, so it almost feels like it would be impossible to ever find someone in that age range for no strings attached kind of relationship :/

(It's not like I wouldn't be willing have sex with younger guys, but I would really have to get to know them before i even start looking at them in ""that way"")


I'm trying to focus on other things, but the more frustrated I am, the easier it is for me to develop crushes and treat every stranger like a potential sexual partner. It makes me feel depressed and not really motivated to do anything. I'm totally lost.


__________________

TL;DR i would like to get laid but I'm scared. I don't know how to deal with sexual frustration, I have no one to talk to and vent. I feel like I won't find a FWB because i like much older men."

On the 6th day I was off my period and by the 8th day I was having unprotected sex with my boyfriend and he finished inside me. Over then next few days we continued to have a lot of sex. I started to notice spotting and bleeding after sex. It went away within a few day but then after intercourse I would begin having extreme cramping. It would feel like period cramps. The pain got so unbearable one time that I had to have him gently place me on my side as I couldn’t even move. Since then it’s incredible painful every time after we have sex. He is on the larger side and I believe he hits my cervix most times that we have sex. I’m properly lubricated during the act of sex and I enjoying myself and I don’t have any discomfort or pain during sex. I had tests done today at the doctors but they didn’t really give me any advice as they didn’t have any results cause it all needs to be done in a lab. Is there anything I can do in the meantime when we begin having sex again to help if it does happen to just be him hitting my cervix. Ex. Positions that are easier, stretches, medicines, etc"

Because it will lead to sexual dysfunction, and other health, and psychological problems that will get worse, and worse the longer he is a virgin. So 40 year old virgins, or older will have a lot less chances of getting a partner, having sex, and having it properly, and healthily.

He also said that it damages their masculinity, and that you're not a true man until after you lose your virginity.

I am a 28 year old virgin. I'm scared, and insulted at the same time.

On the one hand, I'm scared that he is right since you can't argue with a science, and empirical research based site that has credentials, and doctor's, and scientists, and therapists backing them up.

Yet on the other hand,

I am insulted because I feel like the guy is a bigoted idiot, and wrong, and that sex should be a personal choice that we do when we are damn well ready for it, not something we should do by a certain age because we have to for our health.

The problem is that one is an objective fact (healthy strokes) while the other is a subjective opinion (my own feelings) which might make me the one who's wrong here.

I would like to think that this is just some conservative male superiority idiot who supports the patriarchy, and that his views are objectively wrong, and based on outdated immoral concepts of inequality etc.

But when I google the site looking for any evidence against his site, I find NONE. Which pushes me even further into the fear that he is objectively right, and I am objectively wrong.

After all, the sky is obviously objectively blue, and even if I disagree, and give my subjective opinion that the sky is actually green, the sky is objectively still blue.

In other words, the sky doesn't suddenly, and magically become green just because I say it does, and don't like that it is blue, and not green, or get mad at people for saying it is blue. The sky remains blue no matter what I say.

That sky analogy is how I feel, and fear about healthy strokes. There's is the blue sky, mine is the green sky.

I've never been interested in PIV sex, or nudity for that matter. I know I am not ASexual because I have erections from women, am straight, and like the idea of having a partner someday.

I just don't feel any need to go looking for one, or looking for sex. I don't like the passing of bodily fluids, and I don't like naked bodies for some weird reason.

My idea of sexy times is massages, tickling, foreplay, kissing etc. Just not BDSM stuff.

I've always felt like sex, and a partner will come when it does, if ever. If it does, it does. If it doesn't, it doesn't. The idea of never having a partner, and staying a virgin for the rest of my life doesn't bother me that much.

I still like porn, and jerking off. Is it also true that porn, and jerking off is unhealthy, and leads to sexual dysfunctions, and is the reason why people who do it are still virgins at older ages?

Is porn really destroying the world, and our health?

Is preferring to jerk off over having real sex really destroying the world, and our health?

Healthy strokes says that jerking off is fine, and even necessary for our health, but that porn is bad, and should be avoided at all costs. He even says that marijuana is bad for you, and that no one should ever take it at all for any reason, and that pot, and weed also causes sexual dysfunctions, and other health problems.

I have three questions:

Is porn really so bad that I should practice permanent abstinence from it?

Is jerking off really necessary for a man's health? Will I develop sexual dysfunctions, and other health problems if I decide not to jerk off ever again? I don't plan to stop, but if I don't do it every day, is that really bad? How often is jerking off required for men's health?

Is marijuana, weed, and pot really that bad for our health where it will destroy men, and cause sexual dysfunctions, and other health problems?

I also don't like the idea of just sex for sex like most men like. I have the more feminine ideals of sex. I have to either be married, or in love, and emotionally connected to them before anything sexual will take place, and even then maybe still not. I'm not religious though.

How long is it okay to be celibate, and a virgin for a man before it becomes a problem, and unhealthy?

Do I have to go out, and screw someone ASAP, or can I just keep doing things the way I'm doing them?

But after reading that site now I don't feel like a man anymore. Is there something wrong with me?

Note:

It's not that I don't ever want sex, but I am kind of nervous about being intimate with someone, and even going out to look for, and meet someone. I am high functioning Autistic. I also don't like the idea of sex, and the passing of bodily fluids. I'm not REALLY into BDSM, but I do kinda like Fetish, and Kink stuff. Just not extreme, or anything involving pain.

I'm also weird because I have to be in love to have sex. I feel weird because I am a man yet I have a female's ideals."

Also sorry for formatting, mobile!

1. I really hate how a look and my boyfriend (26m) is really attractive, I know he loves and cares about me but I feel like it impacts my confidence in bed. I’m chubby and I know he wants me to ride him but I 1) don’t really know how to do it and 2) feel like I’d break his bed.

2. Because I have no confidence, I feel like I’m like a dead fish in bed. One of my kinks is the feeling of being used/forced ?? (But not noncon? I just like being really submissive/controlled? Idk) so I like the idea of like being in his complete control/ being used but I know he wants to experiment with different things and I just get anxious about how to do them?? So what are some small things I can do to feel more active In bed?

3. I guess I’m generally anxious during sex. I’m more comfortable now then when we first started doing it a year ago, but I feel like some of my muscles are always tended and I don’t realize it until afterwards.

4. My boyfriend sometimes has a hard time controlling his orgasms (which I know is a common problem and I don’t mind, but I can only orgasm properly when he’s in me, so it takes me really long to orgasm again  and I feel like I hurt his fingers too much) so how should I go about either helping him or getting myself off?

5. No one really taught me anything about sex except for not to do it to avoid babies and STDs. I clean my lady bits daily but I noticed that I still have an aroma down there and it also makes me self conscious. I’m hydrating properly, I roughly drink about 3/4s - a gallon of water a day and I try to eat right, but I’m still having an issue.

6. How do y’all shave down there without knicking the lady bits? I get the surface area and get it to a manageable point, but I just genuinely am afraid I’m going to cut my clit?

7. I almost forgot this one, but I’m having trouble orgasming from PIV and I probably can’t. Is there anyway to overcome the feeling of inadequacy that comes with this knowledge and how do I make the bedroom more pleasurable for both of us? We’re too broke students so toys are out the window for us:/

I know this is a mega dump and really personal but  my mom is doesnt help much and tells me that I should know how to do all of this, despite literally knowing 0 things about sexual activity besides how to protect myself and some general things I learned from porn.

I'm a 20s heterosexual female and met up with a 20s male from a dating app. I'm not opposed to casual sex, but I don't typically feel comfortable enough to have sex without a few dates first even if I'm really attracted to the person. This time was a little different and I thought I'd share because it was a great experience. Here's how it went:  

Us, after food/beers, walking back to cars.  

Him: So, how are you feeling about this?  

Me: I'm feeling like I want to kiss you.  

We kiss, end up making out and go to my car. Shortly after this starts, he starts asking questions mid-makeout.  

Him: What do you like? (I'm paraphrasing, but ""in bed"" was somehow implied)

Me: I tell him some things I like and ask what he likes.  

Him: Well, if you want to try some of those things tonight, we can go back to mine, I have condoms, or your place if that would be more comfortable for you.  

Keep in mind we are still very much in the heat of things. The fact that he initiated this conversation is SO hot to me.

Me: Your place sounds great.  

Him: Great, any sexual health/other stuff I should know about?  

Me: (*swoon*) No, not to my knowledge. You?  

Him: Same. I don't doubt that I've encountered people with herpes but have never shown symptoms or tested positive myself.  

I follow him back to his place, we have lots of sex, it's pretty amazing. As I'm getting dressed and ready to leave:  

Him: I get tested regularly and am planning to go again soon, if this becomes an ongoing thing maybe we can swap results?  

Me: Pretty much speechless, as this is one of the best, yet most casual sexual encounters I've had. (Of course, I agreed).

Point is, we had that first conversation in 5 minutes between breaths making out. A huge factor in the sex being so good and the fact that I went ahead with it at all was because I was comfortable enough to let go with this guy since we had that conversation beforehand. The cherry on top was him suggesting we swap test results soon.

I wouldn't hesitate to initiate this conversation if he hadn't, but in my experience it can sometimes be like pulling teeth to have the conversation, and honestly that's a huge turn off. It was such a TURN ON that he initiated the conversation early, and wrapped up the experience with continued discussion about our mutual sexual wellness.  

Tl;dr: The conversation doesn't have to be weird! In fact, it can be pretty damn hot, and lead to better sex. :)"

Bear with me please.

My gf and I have been dating for almost 6 years. We are highschool sweet hearts and we are the first of each other on basically everything.

In these 6 years of dating, we have made about pretty much everything when it comes to sex, except for actual penetration. We have tried it but never get to actually do it. To be honest, most of the times that we have tried it and failed it's because I can actually feel her being not very much into it and it kills my whole mood, and she actually has told me that most of time is because of fear over actually doing it.

We have talked about her attitude towards sex in general a number of times, and everytime, she accepted that she had work to do to become more confident of herself. Some of the issues that I have stated to her were:

1. She has no initiative. I think in these almost 6 years, she has started any sexual thing 2  times at most, and probably only because I told her how I felt but only did it once or twice because of that. She never ever starts something by her self.
2. I do not feel desired. She never tells me or do anything that makes me feel desired. It doesn't go a day that I don't tell her how much I love her body and how hot she is. On the other hand, she has never ever told me anything remotely close to that or anythig that actually makes me feel desired. Am I being a crybaby for feeling this way?

Those were the two main issues that I have tell her a number of times, the conversation always ending up in ""I'll work on it. I promise"", and I try to be comprehensive but always end up feeling frustrated about all of these.

Long story short; we were just talking over the phone a few minutes ago, when we started talking about this again, and she got mad and I think that she felt that my comments were in a form of attack (which were not). She started telling me a lot of things I didn't know as she never mentioned them before. She started saying that she never gets turned on when she's by herself , she never watches porn nor intends to do it or has ever wanted to watch before. She actually went a semester abroad to Europe last year and she confessed me that she never even masturbated or touched herself in a sexual way the whole semester. She never felt the need to do it. That the whole semester she didn't even felt any sexual need to be fulfilled. That she doesn't like when I make sex jokes as they make her uncomfortable. That she feels more secure while wearing jeans rather than skirts or any short or revealing clothes.

 After telling me all of these things, I asked if she ever thought of being asexual, and she told that she has but that she is not even sure about it, and that she never told me because of fear of me leaving her. 

And just in case you were wondering, none of this is related to religion as she is not actually religious. Her family is catholic but not even close to actually being very religious. She does has problems with her family, mostly her mother, and she goes to therapy because of that, and she also has a heavy load of work sometimes, which could be a reason of her low libido I imagine.

I want to clarify that I don't mean that being asexual is bad, because it is obviously not, but personally it would be an issue for me in a relationship.

The things that gives me hope that she is not actually asexual is that, even though that she never starts any sexual activity or in her own words, that she does not feel the need to, whenever I do, she actually enjoys it. She has told me that she actually loves when I lick or even slightly touch her nipples, she does get wet when I start touching her and fingering her. The last time we did something (before this stupid quarentine), I don't know why but when I was touching and kissing her, I started being more rude and rought with her, and after we were done, she told me that she actually found hot that I went more rough on her. So she actually enjoys sexual activity, but if the option is not presented to her, she doesn't feel the need to have any, but she wants to be more sexual on her own.

I really want this to work. I love her more than anything in this world, but her total lack of initiative and not ever feeling desired by her, are dragging me down, and after hearing all of what she told me I have a whole new perspective to understand from her, yet it still bothers me, but I still want to work on it.

What is something that we as a couple could do to make this situation better?

What is something that she can do on her own to make her become more sexual?

And what is something I can do to help her?

tlrd; My girlfriend is not very sexual and I have a problem with it, and she is starting to think that she is asexual but I think she is confused. How can I help her?"

I recently went through a really bad breakup. My girlfriend, who I was deeply in love with, left me for another man. We dated for two and a half years; though our emotional connection was amazing, the sex was just as great.

The issue is, I am having a really hard time getting through this breakup because of the kink we shared. It wasn't an intense and restrictive relationship, but when we had sex it was along the lines of a Daddy/Babygirl kink. With that kink comes a sort of protective desire and not ""ownership,"" but definitely right (in both directions!) to the other person when it comes to sex. It was a consenting part of our relationship and it was lived out almost every day. I always felt desired, loved, and cared for through the way we expressed this kink.

Knowing she's out there with another guy, potentially using the same language with him as she did with me, really hurts. I have a hard time with my own pleasure, because my thoughts drift to her and him, and I feel guilty and try to shut it all down.

For the people out there who share this kink, what are the things I can do to remove myself of this jealousy? And think about it in your own shoes as well to best answer the question; imagine how terrible it would be if the person you shared that kink with left you like none of it ever meant anything."

It’s a chapter of NOW (national organization for women) which is the largest feminist organization in the country.

For obvious reasons, I cannot advertise sexual health as the topic of the club, and must present it as a general feminism club — because it is!

My school is catholic, and has a big problem with women’s sexual health rights. We are not allowed to be prescribed or even fill our *externally* prescribed birth control at the school. This bothers me as I take birth control for a legitimate medical reason and have been on it since it was 12, but they don’t care what it’s for, they won’t fill it even if your own private insurance covers it.

Condoms are considered contraband and are not allowed to be on your person. I attended a much more liberal school before and usually the health center had a bowl of condoms, which was great!

STD tests are not given and you have to be referred to an external doc, which is ridiculous because not everyone has those means.

I want to start this club with the goal to convince the admin to lighten their restrictions on sexual health, while still respecting the Catholic faith. However, is this possible? Of course it will also be a general feminism and women’s rights club, as well.

I also want to serve as a sex education to the women who may have attended catholic high schools and did not receive any sex ed — but a bit more adult than one may have gotten in high school. So touch on identity, contraception, masturbation, assault, etc. I also want to advise on sexual assault as this campus has a huge problem with it and women who don’t come forward.

Basically, do y’all think this is attainable with my school? Or am I wasting my time?"

So I (21F) have recently started fingering myself.  I have noticed that when I finger myself I produce white, clumpy discharge that literally 'squirts' out of my vagina while making a weird 'squirting' sound that I am feeling super self-conscious about. This discharge also has a smell to it which I would describe as sweet and cheesy. Furthermore, I have noticed that after fingering myself I tend to pee A LOT and VERY FREQUENTLY. My urinating frequency decreases after I have been 4-5 toilet times. 
Can someone please advise me whether producing white, clumpy sweet/cheese smelling discharge is normal while fingering? 
Secondly , it is normal for this discharge to 'squirt' out? 
Thirdly, is it normal to have to pee a lot after fingering? 

Any advice would be much appreciated.  Thanks in advance."

I've been reading up on precautions I should take for my sexual health before diving into any intimacy, but I am rather confused on how I should prepare, particularly for casual sex. My research suggests that ideally, I should have a HPV vaccine, wear condoms for PIV sex, anal sex and receiving oral sex, and use dental dams for cunnilingus. But when I read what happens in reality, I get the impression that most people only bother to wear a condom for PIV and anal. No protection is used for any kind of oral sex.

So I had some questions to understand things a bit better. Note that the questions are regarding a **casual sex** context (eg, meet someone at the bar, hit it off and have sex):

**1.** Should I get the HPV vaccine? 

**2.** How likely is to catch an STI by performing cunnilingus without using dental dams?

**3.** Should I avoid kissing the other person in case an STI is transmitted in this way?

**4.** How often should I get tested for STIs?  


Now I wonder if I should do anything differently if I visit a **sex worker**:

**5.** Should I get the HPV vaccine before seeing a sex worker?

**6.** Should I use dental dams when performing cunnilingus with a sex worker?

**7.** Should I avoid kissing a sex worker in case an STI is transmitted in this way?

**8.** Any other precautions when seeing a sex worker?

I’ve been noticing some seemingly off things about my boyfriend and would like to know if I should press him for concern over his health to at least get whatever looked at or if it’s something that may be fine and should be left alone.

First thing is that fora 21yo male he seems to have a really low libido. I know all men are different but I just have such an off feeling about why it’s so low. I’ve brought this up before because I’m the opposite with a high libido and he didn’t really know why he didn’t. “I just don’t” is usually his go to answer when he doesn’t like thinking about things so I don’t know what all to believe on that. I’ve talked to him about how it makes me feel like less and he tries to assure me it’s not me but I mean I can’t help those feelings given circumstances. He’ll sometimes jokingly hump me but isn’t hard, he makes comments over my butt and boobs but again more like a joke (like “ooo look at that nice butt” while slapping or grabbing it), and he doesn’t really masturbate. Again I know a lot of guys are different but I don’t know if this is truly concerning low or not.

Secondly, he really can’t seem to keep hard. Like most of the time no matter what act whether be bj, hj, PIV or anal he really only feels semi-hard. I’ve seen him get harder stretching sometimes more than he is during one of those acts. I don’t feel like it’s ED but maybe correlated to my first concern but I asked him about it even last night and he couldn’t really give me a reason why (not that he has to). I only asked him that because we had sex last night and he had to pull out and masturbate to reach finish because he couldn’t stay hard in me. Again, it kinda makes me feel like less and I’ve brought this up but he can only tell me it’s not me but can’t give me any other reason so it’s hard to believe. 

Lastly, I know porn isn’t 100% real but I’m fairly sure most porn especially the amateur porn guys don’t fake their cum and it’s mostly a sticky white look but my bf has more clear, not-so-sticky cum consistently. I tried looking this up on my own and I saw it could be his diet or whatever but he’s not got a bad diet that I can tell and he stays hydrated but not overly hydrated (his job is physically demanding). It’s not over-cumming because like I said he rarely masturbates and we don’t have sex too often because of outside circumstances. Last thing I really saw was maybe it could be infertility/low sperm count issues which is what led me to ask this. 

I briefly brought this up to him last night, all these points, but I don’t know if this is actually concerning enough to press him to seek medical advice like fertility tests or if it’s not as bad as I think and I should drop it?"

I know this place is not for asking medical advice, so I want. I would however ask how you, women with vulvodynia, and partners of, deal(t) with this aspect to try and keep a somewhat healthy sex life. I would also ask to know if it ruined a relationship, although I might regret asking that later on. And what treatments you've undergone, and if they did anything at all. For science reasons.

I (20F) feel so incredibly frustrated by this godforsaken pain. I feel so sexually and emotionally frustrated. Penetration, no matter how lubricated or turned on or relaxed or I am, even being tipsy, leads to an unbearable ring of searing pain just inside my vagina. I feel like I'm getting ripped open. My boyfriend (23M) and I are at a difficult point in our relationship as is, and this is only making things so much worse. Our sex life has crumpled down to a miserable ball. Sure, there are ""other ways"" to be sexually intimate, but it's damn far from satisfying. I feel pressured and undesirable, I miss being intimate with him. Being plagued by recurrent yeast infections was bad enough, but now I haven't been able to have sex in months. I started seeing a gynaecologist 3 months ago. Three months of twice daily stupid cream smearing and abstaining. Tomorrow is my third appointment, and I can alreasdy tell that again, with the upped dose of gabapentin and pregabalin, nothing will have changed. I am so damn angry and desperate for a fix. We're both getting impatient. He understands and tries to respect me, he doesn't want to put me in pain, but it's clear that this is a large strain on our relationship. I wonder how much longer he can stay patient. I fear I'll try stupid and unsafe things to try and fix this cursed vagina of mine. Communication is key, all good and true, but it can't fix something like this. Talking about the situation does not ease my pain, nor his (and mine) impatience. I'm mortified by my own jealousy of my sister being able to go at it multiple times a day just fine, and only needing ""a rest day"" every once in a while. Why am I denied the pleasure of sex? Why do so many women have to deal with this revolting crap? Why is there so damn little research and recognition about our issues? I just don't know what to do. It'll be a miracle if I don't burst into tears at my gyn's office tomorrow."

I’ve never been this way but I’m sitting here realizing that I just lost an amazing guy because I didn’t know what I was doing with my Vag. The first guy I had sex with went down on me after a night of both of us not showing so obviously that was a disaster. I basically had to force him and it just didn’t put me in the mood for sex at all. Fast forward to the next guy, as soon as we ended up in bed he was heading south and I stopped him from my own insecurities. I said I didn’t like it, which is true the previous guy made me hate sex all together. He licked a strip and afterwards I kissed him and visibly cringed. I was on medication at the time so I thought it was the medication. The last time we had sex the smell got worse. Before my period started I had a weird discharge and thought I possibly had an STD since me and him hadn’t used a condom for a while. I showered and thought everything would resolve itself but no. Once he penetrated me it reeked. He was said “what’s that smell” and started fanning his face. I was so shook I left as quick as I could. That did push me to see a doctor and I found out I had BV. 

But the moral of the story is parents should talk to their kids about their sexual/reproductive health. I basically raised myself because my parents were always working, learned how to use a tampon from YouTube and the internet, didn’t know anything. I’ve learned so much since having sex and I’ll make sure every young girl I talk to know their sexual health. That was so attracted to me and I to him. And it’s a shame this happed with two guys but I’m glad I got the issue resolved. But seriously, parents talk to your kids."

I was previously in a 6 year relationship that ended about 4 years ago. In that time span, I wasn’t with anyone at all. I was busy with medical school and really wanted time not in a relationship. I’ve also never had a desire to have casual sex and always only cared about it in the context of a relationship. That also explains why I didn’t have sex at all in that time span of being single. 

Now I’m currently in a relationship that’s slightly over a month long. We’ve had sex several times and it seems like I’m dealing with premature ejaculation...like I’m lasting a few minutes (2-3 minutes). It’s terribly embarrassing and she is afraid to commit due to this. But she’s also giving me time and is trying to work with me on this but is still ultimately unsure about us as a couple. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Any tips or advice? Hell, words of encouragement would be appreciated at this point. It’s a horrible feeling because we otherwise seem to be compatible and get along really well...it’s just when it comes to being intimate, I seem to be...lacking?

I’m trying Kegels, edging, all of it. Not sure it’s making any noticeable impact. I also try to take care of her first, but I realize it’s not quite the same. I’m at my wits end honestly. It sucks, I’m otherwise very healthy, workout regularly, and do all the right things to take care of myself."

I've also had a harder time than most when it comes to sex and romance because of the toxic religious messages I grew up with, an abusive boyfriend in my teens, and a sexual assault last year.

I've been highly sexual and very romantic for as long as I can remember and am still making the journey to fully be myself in sexual encounters. I like people in general and find hookups are hard to navigate because to me, if you like someone and you liked the sex then you should keep seeing each other under those terms, right? But I know it's not like that for most people and that's okay :)

So last night was hard after meeting yet another cool, sexually competent man and having him slowly blow me off. I thought on it and talked to my friends and eventually came to a few conclusions that I think could help other romantics/HSPs/people who struggle with casual sex. There's one set of tips that are more of a list of theories to affect my outlook, the list I'm posting is those theories in practice. Hope this helps!

1. Be romantic in the moment; if it's who you are, you won't be able to hide it or be comfortable acting otherwise.

2. If you struggle with wanting a good thing to be permanent, then there are ways to commemorate great experiences without becoming clingy or desperate; try journaling about them, re-writing your experiences into erotic fiction or art, or even, if your partner consents to it, record sex tapes or videos (these are always very sexy to listen to later).

3. Don't drag out the inevitable end. It's easy to send a ""good morning"" text after a night of reckless sexual abandon but you're better off parting ways with a steamy kiss and a mental signal that what's done has been done and is definitely *done*."

But we both view it completely differently and need to figure out how to handle it as a team. 

My upbringing was to view it as something to not be shared with everyone. I have only had one partner my whole life and am currently married to said person. I was brought up that when you have sex with someone you are also doing so with everyone they have had it with. This is why stis are so rampant and why everyone for the most part has some form of herpes. I was brought up to cherish it, share it with those you love and not treat it as something to do when you're board, lonely, and looking for self worth. 

The main point only when you know someone, trust someone full heartedly and feel that they are the one that you want to spend the rest of your life with.

My partner on the other hand believes the opposite. They believe that a 15 year old will do whatever they want and believes in promiscuity is fine, everyone is doing it. My partner has been with about 10 partners and views it differently.

Some background, they where kicked out of the house at a young age and sent to live with grandparents after losing virginity. This has caused a hugely negative impact on there relationship with thier family, self worth problems, etc. Views sex as something to pass the time rather than something special.

Now that thats out of the way the next thing is viewpoints on sex workers (weather online. In-person, on a pole, etc) are viewpoints different as well. I dont want to tell my children that as long as thier happy, go for it is a healthy approach. My spouse on the other hand thinks there is nothing wrong with it.

How do you guys suggest we talk about it, and what are your viewpoints on the topic. Would like to hear the viewpoints of all because maybe I'm a prude, or sexually immature about the topic. 

I do not want to lose a relationship with my children, but I also do not want to promote sexual promiscuity. I dont want to tell my kids thinking ill kick them out of my house if they knock someone up or get pregnant, but I don't want to promote it either.

What are your thoughts on the matter, how did you deal with the same issues, how did it work out and what would you do differently if you could go back and change what you did, said, etc.

I hope that this will be a healthy discussion and that I can take something away from this that will help in the future. Who knows what the future holds.

Thanks to all who participated in the discussion."

I'm 19 M and recently I realised it's common for ejaculation to be a little explosive.

Whenever I masturbate and then ejaculate the semen volume is like 1/4th of a teaspoon and it just shows up at the tip from where I just wipe it off, it's usually never messy. Once in awhile it just flows all over my penis.

I did a little research and from whatever I found, weak pelvic muscle is what fit in with my situation the most. Besides the weak ejaculation, I've also had bed wetting problems up until my teen years and even today I don't drink anything 2 hrs before my bed time and make sure I pee before I gts. I had passed it as a small bladder issue up until now but it's also a symptom for weak pelvic muscles.

I used to take meds for my anxiety and depression but I've been off them.

Before we had sex, I asked if she had been tested as I take sexual health pretty seriously (and typically get tested between partners). She said yes.

5 months after we started dating I find out she was sleeping with a number of people around the time that we had slept together. I was surprised because we had never discussed this before, but my only real concern (other than a little bit of jealousy which went away) was if she had got tested and if there was something that I had to worry about. At that time she told me all people who she had slept with were people who she had slept with before and that we does not remember exactly when she got tested and did not understand why I was taking the situation so seriously because she had protected sex with them. I explained that STIs can still be transferred with a condom and I had specifically asked her if she had got a test since her last partner the night we had sex. I moved on from this, even though it really hurt me.

1 year into the relationship I find out that the night before we met and had unprotected sex, she had slept with some random guy from a bar. She says they used protection, but again I feel like she is not being truthful to me since the beginning (did not disclose multiple sexual partners when we first had sex and also lied about having slept with all the people before).

A part of me believes that she is naive and did not know that STIs can be transferred without a condom and another part knows she is really in love with me so she is scared this will seriously negatively impact our relationship. She also takes the position that the dating world is like this and “I am in for a shock if I ever date again”.

I am having problems because every time this is brought up it is framed as slut shaming – which is not at all what I have a problem with. I understand different people have different approaches to their sexual health, but I feel like my trust has been violated.  

Is this grounds to break up with someone?"

I've done some research and apparently, SSRI's, including Prozac, are notorious for causing sexual dysfunction, including anorgasmia. Today I brought this up with my psychiatrist but he won't listen to me. He thinks I'm being ridiculous and Prozac shouldn't give me anorgasmia. The guy also thinks I'm kind of an idiot, or ""I practice very poor judgement"" as he said. He didn't seem to care at all about my sexual health, since I don't even have a sexual partner anyway.

I've been off of Prozac a few times, and even then I couldn't get my orgasms back. I'm concerned that I won't ever get them back. I've heard there's medications that can help but he's not going to prescribe me anything.

32F I have an amazing guy 34M coming to see me in a couple of weeks. We met on a dating app a few weeks back and have clicked so well. We have kept it open ended on the possibility of sex when he does visit. In preparation, I got tested a bit earlier than my usual yearly checkups. He is in the medical field so when I asked him when he had last gotten tested, his response was ""I dont sleep around... I havent had any symptoms.... feel hesitant to get tested.""

We are going to talk in detail more tonight but I am thrown off guard - Not all STDs are symptomatic. You don't have to ""sleep around"" to get one.

Tbh, I am a bit disheartened by the response (especially from someone in a medical field) and would like to know if others share his perspective and can shed some light on it. I would still love for him to visit and get to know each other sans sexy times if he is willing to get tested before we meet the time after that. Is that more reasonable approach?"

First of all, I’m not sure if this is a forum I should be posting this into, so if this isn’t the place or it doesn’t apply to you, I apologize. For the last 10 months I have been shattered emotionally and physically due to a penile condition that doctors either seem to have no clue what the problem is, or don’t care enough to find out. My problem is located on the glans of the penis, or the head, and has been hell on earth, attributing to depression, sexual self confidence, and a lot of other mental and physical stress. I have been tested for the full spectrum of STD’s three times, in case there any false negatives, and every time it came back clean. Also was checked for hpv and cancer and nothing has seemed out of the ordinary.

My symptoms are as follows
- discomfort from any sort of friction on the head, meaning that even walking around causes slight irritation
- redness on the top part of the head and also on the edges, seeming to be where the irritation is primarily coming from
- occasional cloudy pee (but I think this is to sometimes being dehydrated due to me trying to be as active as possible without putting myself through 
hell)
- a sort of swelling around the pee hole of the penis, or urethral opening ( I have asked multiple doctors about it and they have all said it’s either normal or nothing to worry about when I know for a fact it hasn’t always been like that. Could be my mind really freaking myself out but it is weird)
- surprisingly, intercourse of any kind doesn’t really bother me, but I could see that even tho it may not hurt, definitely isn’t helping the problem ( I am also cut, can’t say the other because it is banned )

Through this whole process, I have seen two general practitioners, two urologist, and a dermatologist. I have been prescribed antibiotics, anti fungal tablets, anti fungal creams, numbing solutions, psoriasis and eczema creams, and also was scoped to make sure nothing was wrong on the interior of the urethra. None of these really helped whatsoever and I’m losing a lot of hope that I can ever have a normal sex life ever again. If anyone has ever had anything similar, or have any input on a possible next step, I would really appreciate it! It really sucks and worries me that I may never have a normal ever again, and any help, feedback, and or suggestions would go a long way. Thanks in advance."

I did find a few books to look into from the sidebar but wanted to hear some experiences as well, and I did not seem to find a past post relevant enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been with my wife for 11 yeas in total and after I shut down an attempt to just talk about a fun sex related thing to do in the future, like an asshole we realized that I do not pay attention to her ongoing sexual well being . Whenever we have sex I do make sure she has an orgasm and is well taken care of, but I do not consider their sexual health (as a part of their person, or on an emotional basis I mean). 

&amp;#x200B;

I do not think like ""Oh, it has been a few days, she probably is having a rough time"" or even ask her about how she is doing. Talking about sex for me is tricky due to being raised mormon and some things that come along with that. This means that her sexual side is only engaged when we have sex, and whatever foreplay/flirting comes before that. To make things worse, 

I get anxious about having enough energy for sex, as I previously used to overcommit and go through with sex (even if I was initiating) if I was exhausted, which resulted in a not great time for my wife, who often would be left hanging, or would get the auto pilot version of me, which is not a great time...

I am still a bit scared of this happening to the point if my wife tries to bring up something fun and sexy up as just as a conversation topic I will actively shut them down if I do not see sex as an option that night, and just say ""Sorry I do not have energy for that tonight"" or something to that effect in a very rude, and fast and blunt way, without even considering where the thought came from, or how my wife is feeling in that moment and realizing they are brining it up because it is on their mind and want to talk to me about it. 

This ultimately results in us only having sex on my terms when I either initiate, or ""allow"" my wife to do so if I deem myself having enough energy.  This on top of the lack of sexual communication, banter, and conversation ends up being very controlling, and my wife is understandably very hurt, and has no desire to bring up sexual things anymore, but is talking with me about sorting things out. 

I guess what I am wondering about is, What are some ways to keep a sexual relationship healthy outside of sex? We are married and live together with no kids. We have watched some cute and sex things together, same with some naughty comics and stuff, but I get nervous/uncomfortable when it is brought up unexpectedly, and lately life has been a bit busy and crazy for that, which probably means we need to make some more time to spend together. .. For a while I was reading a book and would talk to them about what I had read that day/night before which worked out well as I had a starting point of things to bring up, and did not need to cultivate a sexual thought. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks you for reading and I sincerely appreciate any help at all!"

I have had some good experience with dating, but when it comes to the bedroom, my experience so far has been mixed with women not sure what they want me to do or not having open dialogue with what they want. I always want to discuss beforehand, but end up getting shy about it and just kind of  'winging it'.

I had a very interesting thought today how wonderful it would be to date someone who is qualified and fully knowledgeable about sex, a sexologist for example. I find it such a turn on when someone is so knowledgeable on the subject, not just the mechanics, but the chemicals that are released in the brain, different ways you can be stimulated, how to improve your sex drive and for sure will know exactly what they want.

I have never had the opportunity to date such a person, I love to learn since I enjoy learning the small details about any given subject, I cannot express how comfortable I would feel with such a person knowing that they understand the subject inside and out to start with."
