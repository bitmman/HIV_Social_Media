Dear Reddit,
My brother and his wife are currently in the process of adopting a little boy from Uganda. They've been going through this process for a few years.
Here's a little back story.
A year ago, my brother and his wife realized how ridiculously comfortable their lives were. They felt convicted about this and decided to try to share their comfort with children who have literally nothing. They raised money and went to see orphans, both abandoned and parent less, in Uganda. Whilst in Uganda they met a little boy named Paul, who was HIV positive between 6 and 8 years old, who weighed around 30 lbs if I remember correctly. He stole their hearts.
They worked with people there to get him moved to a better orphanage, and started the process of adopting him. 
Sadly, the laws there prevented them from being the right family for them. Their hearts were broken, but they weren't ready to stop trying.
Some friends of theirs new of another little boy in need of a family, also HIV positive, in Uganda, available for adoption. They enthusiastically pursued this. 
Back to present day. The type of adoption is different, initially they were doing a private adoption, but for Levi, it had to be through the agencies. Meaning more expensive and much more fast paced, due to his condition and age.
Basically, what I'm asking is if you feel so called, help them out with 1$ and maybe if we get enough 1$ donations, they can meet their goal.
They need I $14,000 by September to be able to go and get their new son.
Also, wanted to include that HIV+ babies have a much harder time getting adopted even though the condition is completely manageable. 
here is a [link](http://www.projecthopeful.org/waiting-kids/matched-children-and-families#Levi) to donate tax deductible. The link provides more details.
My husband and I are both posting this for more exposure.


TLDR: My brother is trying to adopt from Uganda, Adoption is expensive. Looking to reddit to help out.

Thanks Reddit for being Awesome

I mean I don’t think she cheated, we’ve been together for 3 years and she’s proven to my on multiple occasions how loyal she is and I’m very loyal as well.

I mean we’ve done some unprotected stuff here and there. Most of the time   use a condom, but there were a few times where I went in raw for a minute, but then would put a condom on and continue. I haven’t felt any of the symptoms but I’m terrified.

In November there was then a 1-2 week period where I came down with what I though was a really bad flu: headache, fever, vomiting, oral thrush, swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, insomnia. After that cleared away, there was a long period lasting until very recently where my lymph nodes would randomly swell up (neck, under chin, armpits). I very recently also developed red spots dispersed around both of my arms, some even on my shoulder - I attributed this to a heat rash.

So I had sex with someone in a bout of depression after repeated mental pressure put onto me by my family. I got threatened with getting killed by my father at least 4 times and he almost did it and I ended up pretty much with a ptsd. I thought I was losing my mind, had bouts of depersonalization and derealization.

After a month of dealing with these issues I was with a friend and we had sex with a third person. I wore a condom the entire time, except took it off briefly after the first oral (before any penetration) and stupidly used the same condom again after. As far is I could see the condom did not burst and my cum was still in it after I removed it after sex. It all feels like a blurry dream since I was in such a bad mental state.

I got freaked out because we met the third person for the first time, so I did not know their background. When I asked if they had HIV through messages later they said no, but I also know they have a lot of unprotected sex.

I was put on pep a day later, but after 3 days when I went to the HIV centrum they told me the risk was so low that I should stop taking pep. About 5 days later I developed a rash on my inner thighs which looked like infected hair follicles. I was given an ointment by the doctor which helped it go away for the most part. I was also feeling itchiness all over my body which went away after 2 more days.

About 7 days later I started getting a small sore in my mouth that healed after 3 days followed by another sore. I also developed diarrhea. At the same time I also started noticing small rashes here and there that come and go within like 30 minutes up to 2 hours. They are very mild and disappear after a little while. I also experienced burning on my chest at night and acid reflux.

I've not had a fever or swollen lymph nodes, no tonsilitis, a little weakness but I had it prior to this as well (chronic).

I'm really not in a good state of mind. It doesn't help my mother noticed I've been going to the doctor more often and to hurt me she said ""I hope you come down with an illness so bad that all you can do is be fully dependant on my like a dog and you cry about it until you die"".

I had a test the first day after sex and I was HIV negative, I'm waiting for the 6 week mark. I went to 3 different doctors who didn't think much of the rashes and both said if it was serious it would be body wide and not go away so fast. As for the diarrhea they think it is something else causing it. I told them I was scared of HIV but they said my symptoms were unusual and they didn't really suspect that. I am awaiting a stool and urine sample result right now and waiting about 3 more weeks so I can get tested for HIV again.

The reason I'm typing all this is to see if anybody knows what might be going on and if maybe my suspicion of HIV is correct after all. I'm genuinely terrified guys."

Three days after I started having symptoms of sore throat, headache, nights sweats, fever, and swollen tonsils. Given the prevalence of the Delta variant I assumed I had Covid. After two rapid and two pcr I was negative on all of them. I also ended up being negative for strep throat and mono. Dr thinks it might be some other viral infection but still ordered me an STD and HIV test just incase.


From reading online I realize my chances of having HIV is very low, I get that. But test won’t come back for a few days so the mind wonders of course. My main question is whether it’s theoretically possible for me to have HIV symptoms after three days? Most places say 1-4 weeks but a few websites say it can happen a few days out. So some clarity would be appreciated. I’m also concerned about the fact that she was on her period. From what I read that increases the chances, albeit prob still small?

I had unprotected sex with someone I’ve been talking too on the 28th of last month (male on male, I was receiving). He claimed he was clean but last Friday I started having DRENCHING night sweats. I have no other symptoms whatsoever, not even a fever, but I went ahead and got tested that Saturday, of which I tested negative for HIV, but positive for syphilis. 

Now this is where things get odd, I nor my partner have had any symptoms whatsoever related to syphilis, and they never sent the test results to the health department. I had to blow the health department up for two days and once in contact with them they still claimed they had no positive results for me. The medicine they prescribed was also brought into question by the health department as they prescribed me the antibiotic that is only used in this situation if you have a severe penicillin allergy (I don’t).

My questions are do you all believe I should go ahead and get a second opinion from another doctor as something just seems odd about the situation? And how much could I trust a negative HIV result with only 3 weeks since possible infection? 

P.S. the reason I am hammering so hard on the fact of it possibly being HIV is because my ONLY symptom is severe night sweats, though I know a plethora of issues can cause night sweats I know it’s a very prominent sign of possible HIV infection, and from what I’ve read I see that it’s possible for syphilis to cause them as well but nothing I’ve read talks about it being within the acute phase.

I had a hookup with a man who’s hiv status I do not know of. Here’s what we did.
He rimmed me (main act) and he would occasionally put his finger on my hole &amp; his teeth I think. There was one instant with his finger where he kinda slipped it in but I told him to stop. 
     That is where my worries come from, he put his finger somewhat inside . I don’t know if he had any cuts or something.
    Also, he was begging to put just the tip inside but I declined multiple times, it was low-key tempting but I never let him NOR did I put my mouth on his penis. Which makes me feel somewhat in peace of mind.

I'm from India and I recently had a sexual encounter with a sex worker (girl). 

We'd multiple sex acts during that night: 3 vaginal intercourse and 1 oral sex(receiver).

First two intercourse happened during the night, and I was completely drunk so during the second time I didn't had ejaculation. She loosened the condom a bit to reduce the friction (what is the possible exposure?) . We left as it is and went to sleep. 

PS: All the vaginal intercourse were protected expect that intentional condom loose and the oral sex was unprotected. 

I got worried and visited a sexologist. He recommended taking PEP. I started PEP on the third day (50th hour).

Since the encounter I'm experiencing some DISCOMFORT/SORE (not visible) IN MY PENIS and TESTICLES continuing throughout the day. 

I'm bit tensed on my chances of getting hiv or any other STD's.

Please let me know what to do please."

So I’m 21 (F) and recently went to the OBGYN and got my very first pelvic exam and also got tested for STIs. Everything came back fine except for the HIV test. So the HIV 1/2 4TH GEN, RFLX CONF came back as reactive but the HIV 1/2 CONFIRMATION came back as non reactive. So right now my results are inconclusive.

Here’s the summary from the results: The sample was repeatedly reactive by a 4th generation HIV screening method but is non-reactive for HIV-1 and HIV-2 by BioRad Geenius HIV 1/2 Supplemental Assay. Per the algorithm promoted by the CDC, the patient should be considered INCONCLUSIVE for HIV antibodies and a sample with this testing profile should be evaluated by HIV-1 Nucleic Acid testing, (CPL order code 4141, HIV-1 QUANT, PCR).

Here’s some insight on my sex life. So in total I’ve had 3 partners. One was in high school and all he did was put the tip and and pulled out, he had no condom, the second was with my ex since 2019. We dated for about 3 years and had unprotected sex many times :/ and lastly was this guy I met at the gym, two times with the last time being 8/12/2021 with no condom at first but then a condom after but we always stopped before he could finish both times. The first guy was a virgin, the second had two partners before me but gets tested with the last time being a year ago maybe? I really doubt he cheated on me or would lie about his results. And the third guy, I honestly have no clue. 

I’m just scared shitless man, I have so much anxiety and I can’t make an appointment to get retested with an infectious disease doctor until October. My OBGYN referred me to this place to “rule out a false-positive”.  

Idek what I’m asking for on here. I just feel so fucking anxious and like my life is about to fall apart. Idk what the test results mean, so maybe if anyone has insight on that. I just want to prepare myself so if you have gone through anything similar lmk. Please respond if you can, I haven’t told anyone but my mom and I just feel so alone and scared."

1 year ago I was diagnosed with ureaplasma after experiencing urethra tingling, testicular pain, and lower abdominal pain.

3 weeks after diagnosis I got extremely sick. I had literally every Acute HIV symptom you could think of. At 30 days I completed a 4th generation HIV test which was negative. I then retested again at 50 days which was negative.

However, due to continued health issues with nothing to explain them I continued testing. I had a negative hep c antibody test and 4th generation HIV test at 6 months post exposure.

My most recent test was an HIV RNA PCR and antigen-antibody test 12.5 months after exposure with no other possible exposures. Both tests were undetectable and negative.

Can I conclude that HIV is not the root of my health issues over this past year and it’s completely different issue?"
