So I'm making an appointment at the local free testing center to get tested soon. I'm terrified it might be positive and not sure how to handle myself if it is. I've tried calming myself by remembering everyone I've slept with and confirming if they were STI free or not, but it still scares me shitless that I might be positive. So, my question for the HIV+ bros out there is: is life still the same for you with medication? Is there still a chance of it becoming AIDS even with medication? How 'normal' is life for you since your results? Thanks for responses in advance :)

Edit 1: Test is tomorrow at 12:30. It is the 20 minute oral test, so at least I'll know quickly.

Edit 2: Context because I didn't think of it and people are asking. I'm 25 now. Since I was 17 I've slept with 8 people, 2 of them women. 2 times I've had unprotected sex. Currently been with my boyfriend for 2.5 years. The whole ""Even once is enough"" stories are what scare me the most."

w36ea,Really beginning to think that HIV doesn't exist,http://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/w36ea/really_beginning_to_think_that_hiv_doesnt_exist/,[deleted],1,2012-07-05 11:35:36,0,/r/gaybros/comments/w36ea/really_beginning_to_think_that_hiv_doesnt_exist/,NaN,"After reading a post here on /r/gaybros from a fellow bro frightened about his HIV test result, I started to do some random HIV research. I've always had a morbid fascination with the virus because it is terrifying. It supposedly kills everyone who gets it. I started to watch some of the first news reports on AIDS and stumbled upon the documentary ""Deconstructing The Myth of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome"". Pretty crazy stuff. After doing more research and watching several of these documentaries, I'm really not sure if HIV does exist and if it does, causes AIDS. Here are some of the things that got me thinking this way (and as you'll see in the documentaries the microbiologists and docs on both sides generally admit true): 
   The western blot HIV test (considered to be the most accurate) tests for 10 antibodies to the virus, to test positive in America you need to be reactive for two or in some cases three to be considered HIV positive, in Australia you need to be reactive to four. Theoretically, you can test positive in America, fly to Australia and test negative. Your risk factors (the questions they ask you every HIV test, such as ""Do you have sex with other men?"") are considered to determine the likelihood of a positive test being accurate verses a false positive. Immune deficiency is not a new medical phenomenon, it can happen for a number of reasons. Most of the first cases of AIDS were found in gay men who ""lived hard"". Many were frequent drug users and had lots and lots of unprotected sex, a lot of the time on antibiotics to kill STIs that they'd caught. Karposi Sarcomas, (the ""AIDS spots"") were found 98% of the time in gay men, many heavy users of Poppers. The number of people infected who had not developed AIDS, skyrocketed after the first HIV test was invented. The AIDS number was small comparatively. There were also, something like 16 men in NY who had and were treated for AIDS but tested negative for HIV. The first medication prescribed for HIV was AZT, a failed chemotherapy drug from the 1970s that millions of dollars were wasted on. It was useless until AIDS came around. AZT is considered a blackbox drug by the FDA. This means all medications in this category is considered highly toxic and potentially lethal. Many HIV positive people have died from the drugs prescribed for HIV, not from the virus itself. The newest documentary ""House of Numbers"" (2009) tells the story of a couple that adopted an infant from Romania. The baby tested HIV negative in Romania but positive in the states. Doctors put her on AZT and gave her til age two to live. She almost immediately showed signs of HIV after taking AZT. Her parents, extremely concerned, wrote a prominent microbiologist that doesn't believe HIV causes AIDS; he advised them to take her off the drug. She had been on it for 22 months but after the girl was taken off AZT, the symtoms stopped as well. At the time of the documentary was shot she was alive, healthy, and 19. The drugs used today are less toxic but most still do essentially the same thing, kill cells, infected with the virus or not. This kills a lot of the body's regenerative properties. Coincidentally, I know a guy who tested positive in 1991 and is still alive and healthy. He attributes this to refusing HIV drugs. Read the side effects of any HIV drug, they are the very same illnesses that HIV is suppose to cause. 90% of all world AIDS cases are in areas of extreme poverty, lack of clean food and water sound like it could cause your immune system to fail? AIDS was not diagnosed by the western blot at first in Africa (they couldn't afford the lab tests), African docs were given a list of symtoms for diagnoses- many of which are also symtoms TB, etc. There's widespread debate on whether or not the pictures of the HIV virus are pictures of HIV and if the virus has been isolated or seen isolated in human blood. No test used today detects HIV itself, only the conditions or antibodies it's suppose to create. Basically, I'm starting to think immune deficiency isn't caused by HIV (if it exists) but by other factors like lack of clean drinking water, food, and illicit heavy drug use. I AM NOT ADVOCATING BAREBACK SEX. The scientists of this movement still maintain we should protect ourselves from STIs and exchanging body fluid with several partners. This is a good and interesting dialogue to be had in the gay community given that many are terrorized by the thought of HIV infection nearly every gay place we go or every time we have sex. I find it suspect that wealthy nations disproportionally fund HIV drug programs in poor countries rather than clean water and food programs. We give way more money to alleviate AIDS and HIV in Africa than we do to alleviate poverty. Also, that anyone who'd like to have this conversation, reputable microbiologist or not, is silenced. I'm sure one would die more quickly from lack of clean food and water than lack of HIV medication. The people of Africa are not dying of new illnesses, they are dying from poverty- it seems they call it AIDS now. I am presenting this here as something that would interest /r/gaybros. I'm not advocating anyone do anything different in their lives; just presenting information. As for myself, if I tested positive in the future I think I'd refuse the meds. 
   I already know a lot of you will see this as a dangerous conversation to have, but consider the alternative. We are a community continually worried about this deadly illness that is HIV. We are scared to death. We are told to take meds, many people die on meds. Scared people do as they are told. Many have gone decades without these meds and are alive and healthy. At the heart of the issue, aside from all of the strange science that has seemed to have gone on with HIV, consider this: what do scientists that have (for years) questioned the HIV research have to gain? They are advocating that we still have safe sex, live healthy drug-free lives; and we help areas like Africa with clean water and food, that we treat poverty- not throw drugs at them. And those who don't question the hypothesis that HIV does exist and causes AIDS, what do they have to gain? Research dollars, drug company dollars, and continuing their careers in HIV research. So bros, I hope you find this as insightful and interesting as I have, whatever conclusions you may come to. If you're going to post a comment- don't be a douche, lets have a real conversation about it. Here are the links to a coupe of the documentaries on YouTube. Again, ""House of Numbers"" is the most recent and well done. I'm also posting a link to the older documentary ""Deconstructing The Myth of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome"" which has more info but the quality sucks.

wgaau,"Bros, let's have an honest talk about HIV and STDs, shall we? (And... I need some of your advice, if you can spare some)",http://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/wgaau/bros_lets_have_an_honest_talk_about_hiv_and_stds/,bizarro_me,19,2012-07-12 10:43:54,127,/r/gaybros/comments/wgaau/bros_lets_have_an_honest_talk_about_hiv_and_stds/,NaN,"Disclaimer: this is a long and hard post to read. I'm very confused and I need to bounce a shitload of stuff off you.

I'm seropositive - found out 4 months ago. This is not my regular account but the one I use to post secret or disgusting stuff. I shouldn't, really, my main is pretty much unknown amongst my friends, but I'm still going through some self-shaming with this stuff.

For the record, I got it while being horny and irresponsible and a little stupid (do you feel identified?). More importantly, I was afraid of it and I was in denial of a couple of things. 

Here's my current mindset:

- Anyone can get it. Let me rephrase: anyone who has an active and / or promiscuous sex life can get it, even if they take care of themselves. There are always risks. There is safer sex and there is riskier sex.
- Unprotected oral sex IS a risk. If you choose to do it, accept the (possible) consequences.
- Any unprotected sex with ANYONE, regardless of their knwon / declared status, is a risk. They might not know they're infected.
- It's not currently that big of a deal, though it is a disease and it is for life. Most doctors compare it to having diabetes.
- Your best strategy for casual sex is to assume everyone is positive and act accordingly.

My previous mind-set (this might be important if you identify with it):

- I only had unprotected sex with ""good guys"" who declared they've been tested and were negative (I never asked to see a test because I thought it would've been too much to ask for). I wouldn't knowingly have sex with poz guys.
- I did gave (unprotected) oral sex to several unknown and barely known men. I thought it was not *that* risky, it's something I really like to do, I played the statistics, and what little risk remained in my mind, I denied it (ironically, because of my fear of getting HIV).

Again: anyone can get it, protect yourself, and don't be afraid if you do get it, it's not *that* bad (you'll still have a long life and most probably won't die of AIDS).

**Now, to my current problems and why I need your help**. I think I will sound dumb to some of you more responsible guys out there, but I ask you to give your advice and point of view instead of just confirming I am indeed a dumb fuck. 

As I mentioned in a comment earlier today, I haven't had sex the last four months. One issue is I'm not sure of the amount of risk I'm willing to take in a sexual relationship anymore. I felt so stupid and cheated by myself when I found out. Will I be confortable still giving oral w/o protection? Will I be confortable giving it WITH protection? It justs sounds dumb to me, I have never met a guy (or girl) who wants to give or receive oral sex with protection, and I find it very un-erotic. To top that off, I have a huge come fetish, so I'm trying to deal with the fact that I either control that (my cock-sucker come-whore kink) or I'm going to get re-infected. There's something of an idea that cutting those acts off my sexual life will make it boring and leave me forever unsatisfied. 

The second problem is, I feel that unprotected sex is essentially more intimate. Of course, there's a level of intimacy and trust that must be gained before a *healthier* unprotected sexual relationship between two guys. However, I get the feel that now I'm ""dirty"", no one will want to have an LTR with me because, in the end, we can't go the unprotected way, even if we chose to be monogamous.

Third and last, I'm not sure hot to go about sex and relationships, regarding the other party. 

Let's start with hookups: I've been told it's enough if I take care of myself, that is, have the safest sex possible for my own sake. The other guy will be protected by default. I've been told it's not necessary for me to come out as seropositive in every situation as it kills the mood and, anyway, any guy who's willing to have sex with an unknown dude without even asking about it, should be assuming the possible consequences and protect himself accordingly as mentioned above. 

However, I know for a fact that a lot of guys won't sleep with a seropositive guy just because they know about it. Even if they didn't care enough to ask before. Why would I tell them? Is it my responsibility to take care of them? (This sounds dumber, since the seropositive person has a bigger chance of being the most irresponsible one, like in my case - I've heard a stupid argument that it is illegal in the states for a seropositive person to have sex with another one without disclosing - stupidumbest thing I've heard in my life, putting on the HIV+ person the responsibility to take care of BOTH guys). 

And also, if you're kind of promiscuous and do hook-ups, AND you don't always ask / use protection, aren't you assuming that in some of those cases you're sleeping with seropositive guys anyway?

So, what I'm thinking now is: it's OK if I hookup and take care of myself, use protection, and, if the relationship develops forward to more sex or a LTR, and I mean, if we're having sex for the second or third time, no further than that, I'll disclose, that is, if they haven't asked before (in which case I will of course disclose immediately). I feel comfortable with those terms. Do you?

Be blunt and honest, but don't be a douche.

TL;DR: I got HIV and haven't had sex in a few months, I need to go back! But I'm not sure of what is the proper etiquette, and I don't want to be a fucking douche. Also, just sharing some experiences and things I've learned in the process.

Edited formatting.

Edit 2: Done for the day, off to sleep. You guys have all been great, very respectful and you exposed some good points I'm still thinking about. I love this sub.

I've been thinking for awhile now that it would probably be a good idea for me to take an HIV test for a benchmark.  Its been at least 2 or three months since I made the foolish mistake of having unprotected sex and I haven't shown any symptoms and all of HIV or any other STDs but I still am almost too scared to go get tested because I'm terrified of the possibility that I could be infected.  

I guess I'm just looking for reassurance more than anything.  On one hand I would love knowing that I'm clean and having peace of mind, but what if I'm wrong?  I'm only 18 so it's not like I could hide it from my parents.  How would I explain to them that I had hooked up via online (I've since deleted my Account because I am frightened of the road that that could lead to).

Advice?

[The Inside](http://i.imgur.com/HEZ8j) for those of you who don't want to read all that text, basically it states what test I took, how accurate the test but also states that if I was just recently exposed to HIV that it may not detect it yet in my system. 

Then it shows my name (that I signed) and the date of my test. It's one of the greatest things in this area because anytime I get to sexy time, I ask a guy and when they ask me I show them my card. It may be a bit strange but makes me happier to know when the last time a guy was tested.

After a lot of questions, I thought I would do a mini-AMA. Feel free to ask me anything and I will answer when I have the time. I will provide a pic of my test results, as I still have them after I get home from work. I have been positive since 2004 and am undetectable and in the best shape of my life!

EDIT: I am trying to finish up some work, but keep the questions coming and I will respond to each one after work!

EDIT: Okay, here is the proof I said I would send. This is my positive test result from Sept 2004: http://i.imgur.com/JGJG9.jpg

EDIT: One of the discussions reminded me of a Swiss study that was very interesting. As you know, literature in the United States about sex in general is pretty f-ed up. European countries are usually very progressive about things and while the study observed straight couples, it definitely is an interesting way to look at things. I present to you the study in its entirety: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=8035

UPDATE: Okay, so a lot of people have been calling me brave, which I don't think is the case at all because I'm doing this all anonymous-ish. I tried to answer every question that was asked honestly and the best way I can. I am heading to bed tonight, but will answer questions as long as they come in.
BTW, whomever gifted me 2 years or Reddit Gold and sent me the very kind letter. Thank you for the words and the gift!

UPDATE: I hope that at least one person learns something from this. That was my goal. Anyway, some takeaways that I have established: there is nothing wrong with sex. People, especially in the U.S. are very caught up on facts like number of sexual partners, ""sluts"", etc. If you are more open about sex and your sexuality, then you would be more comfortable talking about HIV. There is no shame in the game, guys. Just like it only takes once to get pregnant, it just takes once to become HIV+. Protect yourself but enjoy your life also. Most importantly, the original intent of this AMA, is ask questions, get knowledgeable and informed and challenge things when people say things that don't make sense. Give a poz guy a chance one day, okay?"

Had sex with a guy who informed me he was positive. I recently tested negative a week prior to sleeping with this guy. Things got hot and heavy and right at the end I stuck it in  for a couple minutes and finished, followed by the words ""OH GOD I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT"" 

The guy I had just fucked assured me his viral load was low. The fact I am circumcised, was the top, and only penetrated for a few minutes lead to a very low risk percentage. Nonetheless, I convinced myself that ANY risk of infection meant I had to do SOMETHING... and checked into the ER around 9PM last night, about 50hrs after the possible exposure. 

While the intake nurse and RN both seemed to be casting judgement on my poor choices, when the doctor finally arrived, he assured me I was fine and had less than a .05% chance of contracting HIV. I asked what my options are and he said he recommended  PeP, Post-exposure prophylaxis. This, he said, would cut my risk in half again, leading to a .005% possible exposure, odds I'm much more comfortable with, despite the side effects the drugs can cause. 

To the people of gaybros, and all of reddit: Be smart, use your head, and ALWAYS...I repeat... **ALWAYS** USE A CONDOM. While HIV is not a death sentence, and is extremely manageable with proper medication, avoiding exposure, getting tested every 3-6 months, and using condoms with new partners can keep you safe and in good health."

I talked to a few of you through pm's but I figured I would make a post so anyone who wanted a follow up could see right here. Since my post I have had blood work done and was told my cd4 count is 780, which is above average even for a non Hiv infected person. I guess my healthy habbits have paid off so with meds and regular monitoring I should be fine as far as my health is concerned.
mentally I have recovered from the shock of it to an extent but I'm not the same so I have decided to seek out counseling because quite frankly I need it.

A little back story on the whole situation since I was rather brief on that in my last post. I am 24 and I live in the dfw area. I live a healthy lifestyle and was never the sort to engage in unprotected bareback sex. About a year ago I had met a guy who was by first glance very straight acting and looking, and had no interest in being an out gay man. Lets call him M. M and I had relations for the past year and we always used condoms, even though he tried to go bare plenty of times. well one night the condom broke, that was a few months ago and he came in me. I didnt freak too hard because I figured he was not engaging in much sex with guys besides me. I guess I was wrong. You see we would go months without talking or seeing each other so he probably had a lot of time to meet guys online and probably was doing it bare. 

I got ahold of him the other day and told him the news and he acted surprised and denied knowing he had HIV, but did admit to sleeping with others unprotected though he said it was only a few times. He said he was going to get tested and that he would let me know what happens though I havnt heard from him since. I am really frustrated about the whole situation but I know some of the blame is on me. I should have chosen a partner who was more open about himself and didnt resort to secret hookups in order to satisfy his sexual needs. I may be able to retain my health but now I will have to live with the stigma of being positive, and no doubt will it affect my dating life. I was seeing someone at the time I got tested, and he quickly ended things with me after he got a negative test result. I am pretty upset about that but its honestly the least of my worries right now. 

I guess all I have left to say is thanks to everyone on here for your support and know that I am going to okay. Be careful guys, if you are unsure about a partner that you have you may be better off without them, because you can never trust someone on their word alone."

You might have seen a pretty popular AMA today about a gay man in an HIV vaccine trial.  Unfortunately he seems to be pretty misinformed about the trial, the vaccine, inclusion criteria etc.  I joined the same trial (HVTN 505) back in the fall of 2009 and and completed it this past spring.  I continue to be tested every three months at the study site because if I was given the vaccine (50:50 chance it was a placebo) there is a chance I could receive a false-positive result on HIV antibody tests, so the trial center offers free nucleic acid- testing for life (this test looks for the virus itself, not antibodies to the virus).

If you have any questions about the trial I'm happy to answer them!

Recently there have been posts about HIV, but this needs to be said (for my own mental carthasis and the good of this community).

On Monday of this week, I experienced a splitting headache and soon after a high fever developed. Next, a sore throat. Classic flu symptoms, I thought. Soon after, a rash. I thought that to be an odd symptom, so I scheduled an appointment with my GP. During the course of the appointment, the doctor asked all the typical questions and then delved into my sexual health. ""Have you had unprotected anal intercourse?"" Things of that nature. In all honesty, I haven't yet done anal, only oral. I thought that to be a low risk activity. In those intimate moments, I didn't even think about HIV. 

Next came the bloodwork. The phlebotomist handed me a pen and paper and asked for my signature at the bottom. I signed, not even looking at the contents of the paper. Thinking back on all the times I've had blood drawn, I had never signed anything. So, before handing the form to the phlebotomist, I read the first word that titled the printed page. HIV. I read it. Next, I said it lighlty under my breath as if trying to ward off this invisble monster. I broke down right there. I cried. I bawled actually. This couldn't be happening. I haven't even had anal yet. The phleobotomist was very caring; she hugged me gently and said, ""One way or the other, you need to know."" Of course, I knew she was right. After some convincing, I outstreched my arm and soon after three different vials were filled with my blood, looking so healthy. 

The wait. That was the worst part of this whole ordeal. Arbuably, this was the most scared I've been in my entire life. I couldn't tell my family. It would have become a sexuality issue rather than a health one. So, I waited alone. In bed, I thought and I researched. I went over every scenario in my head. After many hours of thinking, I thought I pinned exactly where I got it from.  

But, I didn't have it. I don't have HIV. The results came back negative for everything. They believe it to be some non specific eneterovirus. My GP did say, however, it could be too early to tell. ""You must be checked again and routinely after that if you continue sexual activty."" I am not yet out of the woods and that seed of doubt has been planted. I am going to be tested again becuase it is too important not to know. I am 21 and I plan to see my nieces and nephews grow and be married

Gaybros, though I don't know you, I want to extend my advice. Please do get tested. Regularly. Our generation was not affected by the first HIV scare. We did not see friends die. We did not catch the virus ourselves. We cannot possibly know the pain that older gay men experienced in the 1980s. I think I saw a glimpse of that scare. Perhaps, it was only one tenth of the scare that plagued the community in the 80s, but it was terrifying nonetheless. I urge you to know your status.

It literally takes 15 minutes of your time, and regardless of the results, it'll be the most valuable knowledge of your life. (and in some cases (like mine!) you can do it for free!)
-

I wonder how many stories start with ""So, I met this guy off Grindr""... well, mine is no different. He was twice my age and in a relationship, obviously the perfect man for me. After 2 weeks of dirty texts and such, we go back his place to do as educated fleas do. 

I don't know what attracted me to him the most, if it was the photoshopped pictures, the GPS he had on his partners phone, or the meth. Mmm. Meth. Whatever the reason, I didn't have the guts/self-worth/sobriety to leave, and embarked on my suicide mission of meth-flavoured kisses and bareback sex. 

I knew, sure as the sun rose that morning, that I was HIV+; and spent the next 6 months convincing myself I was going to die. Panic attacks and diminishing health became my new mantra. Every ache was cancer, and every cold was pneumonia. That's the beauty of stress. Every combination of the letters HIV or AIDS, every time Waterfall by TLC came on, and every advert for STD testing was the universe's way of telling me: I had the bug.  

This Monday I had enough, the random pains were beginning to push me over the edge, and if I was gonna die, I at least wanted to know. I googled free STD testing centres (because I, like many other Americans, have no healthcare) and found one at walking distance. I marched in, convinced of my death sentence, and walked out 15 minutes later, with tears of joy, a plethora of free condoms &amp; lube, and without HIV. 

While I rode my cloud back home, I deemed myself worthy of downloading Tinder, Grindr's better looking and seemingly less slutty cousin. After the second swipe, I got a match: a sexy british lawyer on holiday. *wut?*

(This is going to sound like an anti-grindr pro-tinder advert but...) A single swipe to the right, started the most romantic week of my life. Fast forward to his hotel room on South Beach- we're kissing on his bed and I notice he's a bit nervous. I ask him ""what's the matter?"" to which he confesses that he's ""never kissed a guy before, let alone...well, you know"" 

After melting on the inside, I suggest we cuddle and talk. Little did I know that it would last until the sunrise, 10 hours later. He told me he was leaving to the Keys in the morning, I suggested he needed a tour guide, dropped everything I had for the week and became Lana del Rey.

I took a 20 min home test that came back negative (i know its too early) and have an appointment to go to a clinic thursday (still too early) but I was wondering how boned do you think I am? TMI for advice I bottomed, he pulled out (i know that doesn't really matter). 
I'm handling the news fairly well, mostly because I know whats done is done, but he is very worried he may have given it to me. I'm frustrated because we didn't hook up right away, we had a discussion about safe sex and our partners before we fooled around, we both had, had recent negative tests when we started going out. We where fairly responsible about it and now what? Any advise is good advise!"

After eventually moving our relationship to a sexual level, I made sure to only have safe sex. Nonetheless, I quickly developed some symptoms I'd never experienced before. After the first few times we had sex, I felt very weak (I could hardly move across the house) and had developed flu-like symptoms. 

Naturally, I took to WebMD. I began to get severely worried, because the symptoms I was exhibiting were very similar to those who have contracted HIV. I went to the doctor immediately, and took a series of blood tests. The first test came back negative for the flu. Uh-oh. Why was I so sick then? During this period I began to become so severely worried that I had contracted HIV that it became so overwhelming that I broke down crying out of fear. Had I just ruined my life? Despite using condoms, what if the virus had been transferred through some other means, such as my mouth, a small cut somewhere, or what if the condom itself failed (after all, they're not 100% effective).

The height of my panic came at 8pm on a Thursday night. I had received a call from the doctor's office. While waiting on hold, I was freaking out. When does a doctor's office ever call a patient so late if not because of a serious issue? Once the doctor got on the line, he told me to come into the office the first thing the next morning. Due to protocol, he told me he could not tell me my test results over the phone.

Cue the panic attack. I became so worried that I, through a trembling voice, asked the doctor, to please, please, tell me my test results because I was panicking and would not be able to sleep. He paused, and during this moment I was actually shaking. He informed me that I tested positive. In that split second I envisioned having to tell my mother (who did not even know that I was gay) that I had become HIV-positive. He completed the sentence by saying that I had tested positive for mononucleosis. 

From thereafter I swore to never risk that type of panic ever again. And I've held up to that promise for two years because it was the most scared I've ever been in my life. Despite taking all the necessary precautions, I just felt that it was just never worth the risk (however small). I'm so afraid of being put through an experience like that again that I have not pursued healthy relationships because this fear is still so vivid. I have retreated from meeting anybody because of this fear.

I guess I just wanted to know if any other gaybros here have experienced this type of feeling, and how they've been able to move forward. Cheers.

When my doctor said I had diabetes, liver disease and several other diagnoses I stopped him and said ""I want a CT Scan and Ultrasound."".... Oh, you don't need that"" he says... and two days later I lost a testicle.

Trust your body. If it tells you something is wrong, and you've been stressed out and sick for years... long term damage, gradual damage, immune compromising damage doesn't just stop with exercise and multivitamins.

**TLDR: I have cancer.  Both cancer and HIV are qualifying conditions for the IL Medical Marijuana Pilot Program.**

**If you need to find a doctor in IL that will register you for a medical marijuana card you might find it very challenging.**

Rush and Northwestern Hospital stop their doctors from talking about marijuana as a treatment option with badly worded policies that put the fear into their doctors. Any healthcare provider that receives federal funding is caught between policy and patient's rights.  Denying me information about my treatment options is malpractice. I'm fighting the system.

Naturally, this was a rough time in my life, and took me a lot of time to accept the fact and to be comfortable in my own skin again. Since my diagnosis, I have been on a couple dates and have had nothing but very supportive reactions when disclosing my status, and really the guys who I was seeing were mostly just happy that I was being upfront and honest about my status, and it didn't change the relationship much. However, these were flings and really, the relationships just didn't hold water, and I was mostly going out to get used to the whole dating scene again. 

However, I met a guy recently whom I have began seeing. He's sweet and really sincere and seems like he would be very understanding, but I have yet to tell him I have HIV. I mostly have held off because we have only been on a couple dates, and he seems somewhat new to dating guys (told me he's not out to most of his friends and roommates). And I dont want him to feel like I am insinuating sex early in the relationship by talking about HIV...But I mostly am afraid that I will scare him, and I really dont want him to feel uncomfortable around me. At the same time, I dont want to wait too long, because I dont want him to feel as if I've witheld my status for some agenda (which I guess is sort of whats happening) or for him to feel like I've wasted his time (which I know sounds stupid, but sometimes I cant help but feel that way)

Anyway, what Im trying to ask here is have you guys had any experience with this while dating? Are there more appropriate times than others to disclose HIV status (besides in the bedroom). Also, as someone who doesnt have HIV, how would you like to be told? Right off the bat? or would establishing a connection first help decide if that was a crucial factor in the relationship?

I just really dont want to mess this up. Thanks for the time guys.

Update: it's been like 2 hours but I couldn't sit around and think about it anymore. He's in class so I decided to leave him a text message, one because it's easier for me to articulate my feelings without getting overwhelmed emotionally, and two I don't want him to feel pressured to have a logical and thoughtful response about it. It's kind of a lot to take in, he might want some time to think, but also I'm just a pussy about real talk. Anyway, I tried to explain why I waited to tell him, why I'm telling him now, what it means to live with HIV and how it's effected me. I wish I had balls to say in person how I felt but I don't. So I'm going to put my phone down and try not to freak the fuck out about what he's going to say. I guess I'll let you all know how it goes; thanks for all the responses, it means a lot to have a crew backing me with this shit. I respect everyone's advise, but I did what I thought was right in the moment. Later"

I have created a new community, called /r/ActUp to support a more pointed response to the clinical discussions that we have here.

The discussions about HIV here are valuable, but as the most recent HIV study represented (a study that showed that mixed couples don't transmit HIV, something that mixed couples have reported anecdotally for decades), we must have a place to discuss things that lead science to their conclusions besides simply being clinical and telling people that NO you're NOT HIV+. We need a place to be public, and be aggressive about our reaction to discrimination towards those with HIV and counteract those times and places. Please consider joining and contributing.

I decided to name the subreddit after the name of the famous reactionary group in NYC during the AIDS crisis because of their action and advocacy. If it's a terrible idea, then we can try a different approach with a same idea but a different name, and let me know.

I hope to see you all soon, and let's get HIV/AIDS to be a part of history!"

This came to a shock since he always uses protection and is still overwhelmed by the news and how he got to contract it. 

My husband told me yesterday, but my friend hasn't said anything to me yet. I am perplexed now because firstly I don't know what to do in the case he never tells me. Secondly, I don't want to treat him any differently than before but at the same time being an avid reader on HIV/AIDS research studies I don't see it as bad as my husband is, so I am not sure how to handle this. 

Lastly, I have always struggled with emotions so this specific case is... hard. Any tips from people who faced something similar? I want to be there for him and help him keep it together since I have noticed some signs of depression in him lately."

I wanted to make an update if you participated and might wanted to know what happened next. 

Last weekend my friend told me and explained to me that he didn't want to affect my daily work life during the week. We got to talk a little. I had the opportunity to ask him how he felt, reassured him that he can count on me for everything etc. It went well. 

He asked me and my husband to also get tested since we still don't know exactly how he got it in the first place. After we got our results (negative) he let me know that he was scared if something similar had happened to us also and was already feeling guilty. 

Now we are back to our xbox nights, fighting over what to cook and the occasional burp or fart competition. (I know we are disgusting xD) 

Again, I appreciate all the experiences and advice that you guys shared with me. Until next time :)"

I met this cool guy and we really connected.
I don't know how to tell someone my status right away. I am on medicines that make the possible transmission rate to ""almost 0% percent"". I know that it is wrong to put someone's best interest for statistics. 

But I did it anyway. I promised myself I would only give him oral sex (as this is the only way science has proven the virus can't transfer). However, one night we got really drunk and one thing led to the other and he topped me unprotected. Ever since then, we have used condoms. And I feel so terrible because it is so out of my moral compass to lie. I just wanted to be seen for me, not a disease. And things went to far and I'm so sorry.

This boy is in love with me and I am in love with him, even though of the situation. Lately I've just given him blowjobs because that's what I feel most safe doing for his health. But the elephant is still in my room. 

I already know what to do. And that is to tell him. I just can't break his heart like that.

Please don't hate me, I didn't mean to do this.

Needless to say my world just ended right there.
I know, it was a stupid decision to bareback someone I didn't even know but we all make mistakes sometimes.
It took me almost 48 hours to make a decision to run to the ER and ask for a Post-Exposure Prophylaxis, made a fingerprick Rapid Test just to be sure I was neg and the doctor prescribed me the meds. I'm taking Tenofovir+Lamivudine, Atazanavir and Ritonavir, 3 pills once a day.
I'm going on my 6th day of treatment. The first three days were AWFUL, I had to call my boss and say I couldn't go to work because I stayed up all night vomiting, with a pretty pretty bad stomachache, today I had mild diarrhea. I'm starting to feel kinda tired, my eyes are getting yellowish, my stomach rumbles 24/7 but if that's what I need to do to make sure I'm safe, that's what I'm gonna do.
The worst thing about the treatment is not the side-effects, it's the uncertainty, is not knowing for sure this will work and I can end up being positive in 3 months.
I feel ashamed of myself and my stupid decision. Thinking about sex literally makes me sick to my stomach. Every time I need to take those pills I feel so stupid, so humiliated... I'm sorry, I know that these pills help keeping people healthy if they're HIV+ but I really REALLY don't want end up taking them for the rest of my life.
I've gone through my phone, deleted all gay apps, deleted all past-hookup contacts, I feel like isolating myself for the rest of my life, seriously.
Please, be safe. Wear condoms, don't make stupid decisions you'll regret later. Ten minutes of sex can change your whole entire life."

My friend hooked up with a guy a month ago, who told him he was negative and on PREP. My friend is not on Prep, as he was not aware it could be imported from overseas unless under clinical trial (we are in Australia, but anyway it's semantics).

A few weeks ago he started getting very fluey symptoms and had a blood test which showed up as negative. 2 days ago he got tested again - bearing in mind he had not had sex with anyone else since that guy. The doctor called today advising there was a mutation occurring in his blood cells but could not 100% confirm it's HIV. He messaged the guy on Grindr telling him this and asked if he was definitely negative, the guy replied that he is actually HIV positive and had lied to him. He then blocked my friend on Grindr.


I have been able to find the profile on his account. In Australia the law is that you must take reasonable precautions to prevent transmission. Seeing as the guy initiated unprotected sex I believe he needs to be reported to the authorities. I want to know how we can go about reporting this so the police can locate him using Grindr. Should I just report it to Grindr and explain the situation? I am so fucking angry someone would do this. Also - stay safe kids, people are fucked up.

Any advice is appreciated"

This section stood out as I was reading: 

&gt;Most scientists now believe that risk of contracting H.I.V. boils down to a numbers game rather than a blame game: If the virus is not present in your sexual network, you can have unprotected sex and not get infected. But if you are in a community, like Jackson, where a high percentage of gay and bisexual men are infected with H.I.V. — and many don’t know it and go untreated — any unprotected sexual encounter becomes a potential time bomb. *This explanation of “viral load” helps dispel the stubbornly held notion that gay and bisexual black men have more sex than other men, a false perception embedded in the American sexual imagination and fueled by stereotypes of black men as hypersexual Mandingos dating back to slavery.*
“Black men are not just out here having unprotected sex willy-nilly; the science disproves that,” said Terrance Moore, deputy executive director of the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors in Washington. *He pointed to stacks of studies over the years, including a groundbreaking, exhaustive 2006 data dive led by Greg Millett that was published in The American Journal of Public Health. In this and other studies, Millett and his colleagues found that gay black men engage in risky sexual practices no more frequently, are as consistent about condom use and have fewer sex partners than their nonblack peers.* “It’s that the viral load in communities of black gay men is higher, which puts them at disproportionate risk,” Moore explained. “Plus, these are the same individuals that are dealing with structural barriers around lack of employment, lack of education and opportunities, transportation and, of course, very, very overt institutional racism.”

I do not doubt that high viral loads play a role in the HIV epidemic, nor do I doubt that high viral counts contribute to the higher percentages in HIV rates among black Men Who Have Sex With Men (MSMs), regardless of their self-identity.  The same is almost certainly true across racial groups, and not all or even most sexual networks are racially homogeneous.  Caucasian partners with high viral loads are more likely to transmit the virus to their partners, regardless of race, just as black partners with low or undetectable viral loads are less likely to transmit the virus to their partners, regardless of race.  You can substitute the race or ethnicity of the partner and that does not change.  This is nothing new, and that is one of the reasons regular testing and early treatment are encouraged alongside preventive measures like reduction of partners, reduction of alcohol and drug use before sexual encounters, condoms, PreP, and PEP.  

But as I posted in a comment reply here, my major objection to this is ""the science disproves that,"" a claim that is not challenged in an article that blames viral loads and lack of resources as well as institutional racism for the high HIV rates among black MSMs.  First of all, the cited article's abstract states that ""high rates of HIV infection for Black MSM were *partly attributable to a high prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases that facilitate HIV transmission* and to undetected or late diagnosis of HIV infection.""  Both the NY Times article and the man citing studies do not mention this finding.  It also does not mention that the quoted article is a literature of previous studies.  Nor does anyone question the reliance on a single literature review conducted in 2006 using data from surveys that are much older.
 

Even worse, the article does it mention that 2 of the 5 studies that had surveys of sexual behavior in the first decade of the AIDS epidemic *did* show differences in unprotected anal intercourse when comparing blacks to whites.  Other studies had different results, some showing that there was lower prevalence of unprotected sex.  The cited paper does not have the survey numbers for individual studies apart from noting that collectively the study evaluated 4000 MSM and the SF area study evaluated 250 black MSM, and that one found that 52% reported unprotected anal intercourse and that was higher than for white MSM in the same time period.  Of the studies published since 1992, one was discounted entirely because it did not differentiate between unprotected vaginal sex and unprotected anal sex, although that study found that black MSMs were more likely to have unprotected sex than white MSMs.  Discounting an entire study of MSMs because the survey did not distinguish between unprotected anal sex and unprotected vaginal sex is puzzling; although the probability of transmission of HIV in the latter case is much lower than the former, the fact that unprotected intercourse is taking place is of course relevant in any discussion of HIV transmission and risks among different populations.  

For the [latter study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2594963/), which was published in 2004, this is what was reported: 

&gt;African-American gay/bisexual men (n=12) were significantly more likely than white gay/bisexual men (n=32) to report unprotected vaginal/anal sex in the past six months (67% versus 22%, p&lt;0.01), **since diagnosis (42% versus 9%, p&lt;0.05), and to report a history of intravenous drug use (50% versus 3%, p&lt;0.01)**, but did not differ from heterosexual African-American men (n=15).

Again, these are MSMs reporting unprotected sex *after diagnosis*, which significantly increases the risk of transmission.  Yet the study is discounted because it does not differentiate between vaginal and anal intercourse, even though the population being studied has already been identified as an MSM population.  


Now the sample sizes of that survey are very small, but this leads to another issue: The surveys are all based on self-reporting.  There are many reasons why self-reporting in this area is not particularly reliable.  But we do have some reason to believe that this is a much bigger problem for black MSMs than white MSMs, at least during the relevant time periods: The studies analyzed in the 2006 literature review *overwhelmingly* demonstrate that black MSMs are far less likely to identify as gay or associate with gay culture/media/groups, and less likely to disclose their identity or behavior to close friends or casual acquaintances. 

But because only 3 studies that were considered for the literature review tested for associations between disclosure of sexual identity and HIV risk behavior, there was very limited data on that point.  One study published in 1992 with survey data from 1990 ""found that Black MSM who were uncomfortable disclosing their sexuality to others were more likely than Black MSM who were “out” to engage in unsafe sex.""  According to the literature review cited by the New York Times, [a 2002 study found the opposite](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12476265), but the abstract of that article states that ""results indicate that AAGBM who possess more positive (i.e., integrated) self-identification as being African American and gay reported higher levels of self-esteem, HIV prevention self-efficacy, stronger social support networks, greater levels of life satisfaction, and lower levels of male gender role and psychological distress than their counterparts who reported less positive (i.e., less well integrated) African American and gay identity development.""  Given this discrepancy between the meta analysis and the abstract, which is all that is available publicly, we can set aside this 2002 study as supporting what the literature review claims for now.  

The [final study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12588004) on this point, a survey of data from 1994 to 2000, distinguished between young MSM who do not disclose their sexual orientation (nondisclosers) and those who do (disclosers).  Several limitations apply to this study, first and foremost that it only evaluated young MSM 15-22, not MSM from every age category, and indicated that overall (not broken down by race) ""8% of 637 nondisclosers were infected with HIV compared with 11% of 4,952 disclosers."" Among blacks, ""the prevalence of HJV infection was 14% among 199 nondisclosers compared with 24% among 910 disclosers.""  But importantly, [this data was survey data collected](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5021a4.htm) in gay venues or, as the CDC puts it, ""public venues where young MSM congregate (e.g., urban shopping blocks, dance clubs, bars, and young gay organizations).""  All participants agreed to test anonymously for HIV.  There is no reason to conclude that this study is particularly representative, particularly for nondisclosers since we can safely assume that there will be nondisclosers who are not comfortable frequenting those venues in the first place. 

Not only did the study find that HIV prevalence was higher among blacks than whites, which any study will, but also that HIV prevalence *increased with age.*  Again, these age-based differences could be important causal factors when there is established and uncontroversial association with nondisclosure of sexuality and behavior and older age, at least for MSMs.  There was also a much higher HIV incidence rate (% who tested positive per year) for MSMs who identified as heterosexual, even though there was not a single recent positive HIV test result for those who reported only sex with women in the last 6 months By contrast, there was a 2.4% incident rate for those who reported only sex with men and a 4.3% incident rate for those who reported sex with both men and women. 

While the June 7, 2017 NY Times article cites a 2006 literature review for this proposition, no one can be bothered to examine  a [2015 paper that analyzed the results of a survey of black men who have sex with men](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24608176/) conducted between July 2010 and December 2012.  Taken at face value, the survey results would seem to support the NY Times article's suggestion that sexual behavior(and injection drug use) does not vary by race and, if anything, black men who have sex with men are *less likely* to engage in higher risk behaviors: 

&gt; Black men were younger, more likely to be bisexual and unemployed, had less educational attainment, and reported fewer male sex partners, fewer unprotected anal sex partners, and less non-injection drug use. 

So what's the problem? The very next sentence is the problem: 

&gt;Black MSM were **significantly more likely than white MSM to have rectal chlamydia and gonorrhea**, were more likely to have racially concordant partnerships, more likely to have casual (one-time) partners, and less likely to discuss serostatus with partners.

If a group is significantly more likely to than another group to have a sexually transmitted infection associated with high risk sexual behavior, in this case, unprotected sexual intercourse, the results have to be squared with the self-reporting of fewer sexual partners.   One way of squaring the results is suggesting that there are higher barriers to testing or treatment, but that is not the *only* way of squaring the results.  The 2015 study, which surveyed Atlanta, did not square with self-reporting in a 2010 paper that analyzed results from a [2006 survey in the same city](https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/psrh/2010/09/sexual-partner-selection-varies-race-among-men-who-have-sex-men):

&gt;In the six months prior to the survey, blacks had had insertive or receptive anal intercourse with a greater number of partners than had white men (mean, 5.1 vs. 3.6), but the number of HIV-positive partners with whom participants had had unprotected anal sex did not differ by race. Whites had had unprotected anal sex with a greater number of HIV-negative partners in the past six months than had blacks, regardless of whether they were the receptive partner (1.0 vs. 0.5) or the insertive partner (0.8 vs. 0.6). Blacks, on the other hand, had engaged in unprotected anal intercourse with a greater number of partners of unknown HIV status than had whites, both for receptive sex (0.2 vs. 0.1) and for insertive sex (0.3 vs. 0.1).

Taking all of the above into account, does the **2006 literature review** really stand for the proposition that ""the science disproves""  there are differences in sexual behavior based on race and sexuality identity disclosure? Absolutely not, and it is incredibly irresponsible to suggest otherwise, particularly when the ""science"" is self-reporting by willing participants and much of the data that supports the alternative conclusion is disregarded, downplayed and, in at least one case, potentially misreported.  

I have no doubt that the other factors cited in the article play a role, but it seems to me that the article and the quote want to present a narrative that isn't supported by the very data that they are citing.  And that's unfortunate.  Not only is that approach a bad strategy for addressing the risks facing MSMs of all racial groups, it also undermines public confidence in reporting on these issues when exposed, and feeds into a conspiratorial belief that large media outlets promote an ideological social justice narrative at the expense of accuracy.  High viral counts, sexual networks and barriers to prevention and treatment are always part of the story, but available studies and surveys simply does not and cannot support the proposition that there are no differences in sexual behavior and risks among different racial groups.  

While viral counts, institutional racism, cost barriers to prevention and treatment, unemployment and the effects of homophobia should of course be taken into account and studied, there is nothing in available literature to suggest these are the sole or even major explanatory factors for higher rates of HIV infection among black men who have sex with men. But instead of dealing with the conflicting and muddied studies and survey results that are available, the New York Times and an HIV educator chose to focus on an explanatory variable that fits a social justice narrative.

Anyway it’s been about 2months since I found out I’m positive. Honestly it’s not a shock to me, I have had unprotected sex with men more times then than safe sex. I’m 24 years old  and never have been in a relationship boy or girl for that matter. When I was younger I was not happy with myself so I chose risky behaviors because I did not care about my life or my future. Now that I look back I was depressed and felt extremely lonely. I should of gotten help instead of seeking strange men to make me feel wanted.

I don’t know why I’m writing this everyone knows of HIV and it’s seriousness I just hope that someone else will make a better choice than me or be strong enough to seek help when they need it.

I’m HIV+ now and nothing can change it now but you can still be safe.

I want to start this off with if there's any interest, I would chronically describe what I'm currently going through in hopes of someone like me, is doing a search, can find this post and see that it's not as lonely as it may appear.
This past Wednesday, my doctor called and asked that I come in to see her. I didn't think much of it because I was sick recently with what I thought was the flu, but without the stuffiness, just the feeling like I was hit by a bus. She tells me that I tested positive for HIV.
The purpose of me writing this post is because after the initial shock and wanting to vomit and pass out, I started a search on Google and Reddit to see what experiences other people have had when they found out. Unfortunately, I did not find many current results, and while there were many supportive comments in different sub-reddits and threads, none really talked about what you can expect to feel in the now.
And that's just it. When I was told by my doctor that I tested positive for HIV, aside from my shock reaction, I immediately became afraid. I knew it wasn't a death sentence, even though I could tell my Dr thought that was what I was afraid of. No, my immediate fear came from the feeling of being alone. It felt like all of a sudden, my family, my friends, just vanished, and I was completely alone with no one to talk to. My doctor immediately called an infectious disease doctor to set up an appointment to begin treatment, which is tomorrow (Monday). That day, I went back to work, even against my doctor's wishes, because I needed to feel normal. I had to go back to what felt routine. Had I simply taken the rest of the day off, I would have gone home, and spent even more time reading articles and other peoples experience and drive myself even more crazy trying to figure out whom I could have given me this. To be honest, whenever I read an article (not a thread like this), I get depressed. So back to work I went. It helped a little to get my mind off of the recent news.
I still felt pretty sick to my stomach though. I had to tell my bf, and have him get tested because we've been together for years and no longer used condoms. That was one of the hardest conversations I've ever had. He was concerned, but was not upset of my diagnoses in the sense that he thought I had cheated on him. Rather, he was reassuring that everything was going to be okay. Which, as I mentioned before, was my fear of being completely alone. I thought this conversation would be the first instance of people in my life leaving me. Luckily, the clinic was still open for free HIV/STD testing, so we went together to get tested. On our walk there, we discussed where I could have contracted this, and while I was racking my mind, he reminded me of a threesome we had where I had bottomed for a guy (the guy used to be our friend, not anymore for more reasons than just this), and being drunk, I can say now with certainty that we did not use a condom.
We get to the clinic, and there's no line, so we get seen immediately. Thankfully, his test came up negative, but has to go back in a month to get re-tested. I decided to get tested again. I guess to squash all hope of a false positive. When I tested positive again, there was not any shock because I already knew my status. I spoke with the counselor for a bit. I told him that I was already diagnosed earlier and why I was there. He told me of some support groups, but I am not ready to tell people yet. He tried to reassure me that everything is confidential, but I said that I did not want to talk to someone that I could potentially see out in public (I live in a walkable city). I did ask if there was anything online that I could reach out to in terms of support, but he said he did not know of any. He gave some information that once I become undetectable (low viral count), it would be difficult for me to transmit to my bf, but we should still be safe (wear condoms) and that he should get on Prep. (On a side note: if you're in a committed relationship, consider Prep. I had considered it before, but my bf began asking why if we're in a relationship, unless I planned on cheating on him. So I never pursued it.)
The pamphlet wasn't as helpful as I thought it would be. It was actually rather depressing. Aside from the information that I already knew (i.e. don't have sex, and if I choose to, don't have unprotected sex, get treatment, etc.), it made mention not to drink, smoke, do drugs, or share needles. I don't do any of those except drink. And I only drink in social settings. I'm very much an introvert when it comes to settings where there are a lot of people and where I know very few of the people there. So I have a few drinks to relax. My feeling right now is that my life is going to be extremely boring if I can't drink. I have tried going to bars/clubs with friends and not drink, but I end up feeling very uncomfortable and sneaking away at the first opportunity. As a matter of fact, a lot of my current friends, I have met because I was relaxed enough to talk to them. I'm hoping that the ""no drinking"" rule is more for those alcohol dependent, and my infectious disease (ID) doctor will tell me my drinking habit will be okay. Just to be clear, I don't drink everyday. I would say on average, I go out to happy hours maybe once a week in the Spring/Summer season, and even less in the Fall/Winter seasons. I rarely if ever get black out drunk anymore, but if I had to put a number to it, I think I may get drunk (not black out) maybe once or twice a year. I'm getting anxious about seeing my ID doctor tomorrow to answer my questions about living a ""normal heathy life"", because the latest article (I think it was sourced by the CDC) said that HIV is no longer a death sentence, and that someone catching it at 20yo, can live into their 60s. Well, to me, that was extremely depressing. I looked at it as, I'll work right into about the time I should be getting ready for retirement, then what? Get sick and die? What's the point? If that's true, then so many other life long goals are now shot. I guess what I mentioned in the beginning about feeling alone, also meant that my long term goals in life were gone. One thing that has motivated me through life is having short term, moderate term, and long term goals. One of my long term goals is buying a house. Another is traveling for months at a time. I often thought that I could quit my job at any point and travel, but now I'm going to be dependent on my job for the insurance benefit.
I'm not writing this to make this positive, nor am I writing this to make it negative. This is simply what I'm going through right now, and if anyone else is searching to see if anyone else was just recently diagnosed, they can find this. I know if I had found something similar, I would feel a little better about this situation. Maybe it'll make someone else have slightly less anxiety.
TLDR: Just got diagnosed with HIV, letting you read my experience, especially if you just found out about your status."

After that I tried to go back in but couldn’t get hard again (from being with a random) and eventually stopped after about 2-3 mins, never going back in. I took the condom off by pulling it from the base evenly with both hands and making sure the outside didn’t touch me. 

I asked him a couple of times about his status to be sure throughout the hook up and before we met. He said he’s negative and also ensured I bought condoms before I showed up. I haven’t had any symptoms or problems but I still can’t help but to think about it. I wanted to save actual sex for a guy I date in the future, not someone from Grindr.

We both were trying to apply for something that required us to have a full physical exam and my results were negative - everything was clean.  However, we had unprotected sex somewhere between the exam and the results, and I'm terrified. I don't know what to do.  I know this is the most recent time I was exposed and that was roughly two weeks ago.

I mean obviously I know I get tested in three months and once again in six. But I mean I just don't know what to do I feel sick to my stomach. 

So here's the thing, my boyfriend was a lying dirty hoe bag and I was a stupid fool in love. And I know we've all heard this story so I'll spare you the drama. 

My question is: How likely is it that I have HIV? 

We've been together almost two years and I tested negative. This is a good sign considering I've had two years to basically contract it right? He doesn't know how long he has had it. So he also lied about being tested and knowing is HIV status when we were first dating. So assuming that he's had HIV during the entire span of the relationship I have been extremely lucky and is that a good sign that I I won't actually have it?

 ... Or of course the fact that he's a dirty lying hobag means he could have gotten it at any time from anyone and it has just recently taken hold in his system meaning I'm pretty much fucked ...

And it's at this thought that I comepletely break down and freak out every time.

I don't know what to do - I have no one to talk to. I feel like my life's going to be over. I don't know anything about this or where to even start I can't believe I'm so stupid. Someone please help me I need advice or something, I don't know. I feel so lonely

In September 2017, the Center for Disease Control (CDC)[ issued a statement](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/library/dcl/dcl/092717.html) in support of a growing body of research that indicates that HIV+ people who have undetectable viral loads cannot transmit HIV to their partners. 

&gt;Across three different studies, including thousands of couples and many thousand acts of sex without a condom or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), no HIV transmissions to an HIV-negative partner were observed when the HIV-positive person was virally suppressed. This means that people who take ART daily as prescribed and achieve and maintain an undetectable viral load have effectively no risk of sexually transmitting the virus to an HIV-negative partner.

Here is a screen shot of the letter.

This is the only place where I can ask for help for this situation. It seems contradictory since my last post on this forum was about how I hated anal sex. This post might seem stupid for some people, but please understand me.

On June 19, I had a hook-up with a guy I met on Grindr. He insisted on anal sex and I said no but anyway we went to a motel. I put half of my penis inside of him about three times for about 10-20 seconds each time. I tried to penetrate but he couldn’t take it. I rubbed it against his cheeks a few more times and we did oral. No condom was used. No visible ulcers or blood of any kind, his butthole was squeaky clean. We decided to switch to mutual masturbation. I ejaculated on my hand and he ejaculated on his abdomen.

On June 21th I arrived to Monterrey (Mexico) for a business trip, the weather was a little bit cold by their standards (25C / 75F) with lots of rain and I was walking under the rain for about 35 minutes.  The next three days the weather went back to normal for Monterrey (37C / 98F).  I arrived back to my country on Monday June 25th and started feeling unwell with some fever (not too high) and headache (not too strong). 

I began to read about initial HIV symptoms and I don’t have skin rash or swollen lymph nodes. No fatigue, no joint pain, no diarrhea and no fatigue. But I do have a sore throat.

I know I need to get tested at 3 and 6 months just to know. I don’t have a very active sex life, so I usually get tested once or twice a year.

Now, how high is the risk I have taken? Obviously, I won’t do it ever again even if I like the guy a lot. I usually stick to oral sex, mutual masturbation and frottage.

I think he said that he is currently 'undetectable' whatever that means

I really want to help him, as I'm under the impression that if properly done, there is little risk involved. The biggest issue is that he cannot do Prep, as they are struggling financially, and he won't accept my help :/

Are there any forums/subreddits I could introduce him to, so he can gain more confidence and more knowledge on the subject, and if actually can have sex with his bf. He loves him so much it kills him inside that he can't please him"

I'm 33 y/o but still pretty inexperienced sexually and have only been with a few women, the last was close to 10 years ago. I stumbled coming out of the closet about five years ago and went back in. I finally came out and stayed out about a year ago.

Well, loneliness has finally gotten it's hold on me and I am starting to go out and try to meet people. This weekend, I went to a local gay bar for pride. ""No better time to meet someone!"" I thought.

I made some ground rules before I went out and repeated them over and over to myself so that drunk me would remember. In hindsight, the order is wrong.

1. Tonight is the night I suck my first dick.
2. No sex with anyone that's HIV+, you are not on Prep!

-

Well, I met a handsome older British man at the club and we drank, danced, and once we were both wasted, he told me he was HIV+. I insisted that I would not have sex, especially unprotected because I'm not on Prep! He was clearly not into the idea and continually pushed and whispered his desire to fuck me bareback, but I knew my rules. I was happy to leave it at dancing and kissing.

After dancing together and making out a bunch, the bar closed. ""Just walk with us, we won't do anything"" so I went. ""Come up and smoke with us, nothing else will happen!"" and I followed, what could be the harm in a little weed and conversation? 

When it came time to leave, ""let's take a shower and you can wash my back,"" again with assurance that nothing else would happen.

In the shower, he was more forceful. He did not abuse me or anything, but he pushed my head down to his cock and I put it in my mouth. I was so excited for this moment for so long, but this was not what I wanted and he was very rough and fucked my face. I stopped him after a minute and he sucked me for about 20 seconds, but whatever magic was there before, was now gone. Neither of us had cum.

I left shortly after and let him know that he was too pushy. I was clear where my line was all night.

- 

That was Saturday night (Sunday morning), today is Monday and I am freaking out. I was able to get PEP and took my first dose 36 hours after I performed oral on him. I know that the odds of contracting HIV from performing oral with out ejaculation are pretty low, and PEP lowers the odds even further, but my panic will not go away. 

But the odds feel incredibly high once you are facing them. I just can not let myself relax and forgive myself. Today, I have gotten symptoms of a sore throat and a very low fever (99.2) and now I'm really loosing it. 

-

My hope is that talking about it with someone will ease my stress, but I also want to give my story as a word of caution. I've waited my whole life because of fear and anxiety and the first time I acted on something, it went as bad as it could have.  Make your rules while sober and not horny make them conservative!  The thought that I ruined my life over a momentary lapse in judgement and over a guy that I really only liked because of the accent is tearing me up. There is no rush, it doesn't have to be TONIGHT, it can be tomorrow, next week, next month, whatever it takes for you to stick to your rules, especially in the heat of the moment.

Pray for me Gay Bros, I fear that I will need it.

Scenario:

Two guys barebacking, they are regular fuck buddies. They both say they are being exclusive but won't commit to a relationship. 

Neither of them are on prep and basing their choice on trust alone.

*My mates view is - This is fine, you eventually have to trust someone and take their word for it, so pending trust you go for it.
*My view - That's insane, get prep at least.

I'm trying to find an article that shows HIV statistics, I'm sure I've read that most cases are between people who know one another....

Anyone got any recommendations?

I need to get it off my chest and as stated in the rant I don't have much support right now. There is nobody close to talk to about this.

So I blew a guy I met on a dating app. We talked for a few weeks  before we did anything and discussed std status. He said he was all clean and so was I since I had never been with anyone before.

After we were done we talked some more, and some things he said didn't line up with what he told me before mainly number of partners. The difference wasn't a guy or 2. So I got scared that he had lied about his std status too.
Thinking better safe than sorry I booked an  appointment on friday for a general std check.
Saturday I get a call saying I need to go to the ER because the screening came back positive for hiv.

At that point I start to panic my family drives me to the hospital. They take blood and keep me waiting for 5 more hours before sending me home with no results.
I text the guy he panics too starts calling me names. I didn't want to be the guy that made somebody sick so if I did in fact have it he can start on pep right away.
During the wait I was racking my brain to think were I could have caught it. Being an anal virgin and all and having given head for the first time 3 days before.
Since it has an incubation period it couldn't be from the guy I blew. Chances of getting it that way are low too.

The next day I call the ER and the results are in. It was negative.
They sent me to the center that handles std tests and hiv medication for the region were they test me again to be sure. Everything comes back negative.

Everybody happy that I'm negative. 
Now they all just think I'm some kind of slut who goes around fucking multiple men. Even my gp thinks I'm a slut now. She warned me about sleeping around like I actually do it.

If anybody says ""I hope you've learned your lesson"" again, I'm punching them. That's all I've heard since getting confirmation that it was negative. 
Some even asked why I went to get tested in the first place because if I don't sleep around I don't need to get tested.

Not once did I think about hiv when I booked the test. I thought maybe ghonorea or chlamidia. I didn't see it coming at all. I just wanted to be safe by having it checked out.

The whole thing was scary af.  But I did learn that if it comes down to it I don't have anything to fall back on. They will handle me with a 10 foot pole if anything happens.

Currently I'm a mess. I'm happy the test was a false positive. But I'm dissapointed in the people in my life. I really thought they had my back like I have theirs. Seems I was mistaking."

It was a miss on Malek's part not to recognize the disease that took Freddie, a rock and roll legend and HIV/AIDS icon.   I'm not suggesting some sort of career controversy but it was a faux pax nonetheless.   Frankly, I'm scratching my head a bit as to how there wasn't a coordinated recognition and positive capitalization of this moment on the timeline of HIV/AIDS history especially given Elton John's place in Oscar culture with the AIDS Foundation after party.  I'm old enough to have a best friend who lost a brother\* to AIDS at a time of intense secrecy and isolation and even greater stigma.  A time when people wouldn't shake my friend's hand so they wouldn't catch the ""gay disease"".  I'm so grateful to have seen those days pass and we now see greater awareness and inclusivity.   Now we see medical treatments that can reduce the virus to a level of undetectable.  There are even meds (Truvada) available to help reduce to the chance of transmission.  But this is not a virus or disease to be slept on and I'm disappointed Malek did not use his platform to offer some acknowledgement of a disease that while not nearly as lethal still very much can be.  Hey, his speech was one of my favorites of the night.  People who remember to thank mom first always rank high with me. And, I thought the rest of it was sincere and heartfelt but this would have just been the most wonderful cherry on top.  If this was some sort of oversight associated with the nerves of being on TV in front of bazillions I will lighten up, but it just seems that it might have been pretty high up on the list of points of recognition.  I guess I'm just saying if people can remember to get in a well earned tRump jab, one might bring a little light to a lethal disease.   HIV is still a thing.  We still need to be reminded that it can be prevented.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I'm being overly sensitive, but it could be that AIDS was the ""polio"" of my generation.  While there is plenty to be grateful for there is much to be on guard for as well.  As we can see by the measles epidemics from Madagascar to Washington State, USA things will come back to bite ya in the ass (thanks anti-vaxxers - GFY).  We have to be vigilant.  Get tested.  You are wanted, needed and loved.

avz1hp,HIV+ diagnosis. Need help.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/avz1hp/hiv_diagnosis_need_help/,owlcitizen44,63,2019-02-28 17:51:37,30,/r/gaybros/comments/avz1hp/hiv_diagnosis_need_help/,Health/Body,"Hi guys. I’m a 23 year old male.

Yesterday, I was diagnosed with HIV. I gave blood about two weeks ago and that’s how I was informed. The Health Department tracked me down. 

Initially, I was terrified. I knew that HIV wasn’t a death sentence, but I didn’t know how I got it. I’ve only ever been with one person, who I’m still with as of this post, and I’ve never used drugs or drugs with needles. Also, I’ve donated blood numerous times before and it has never turned up anything.

So, you can imagine my confusion. My boyfriend has never been HIV+ and we were both clean. He reassures me that he’s never cheated in the two years we’ve dated which leads me to think he got it before he met me and unknowingly gave it to me. 

He is very beat up about it and inconsolable.
Myself, I’ve accepted that I have it and it is 
life-long. 

But I do need help. I don’t know where to start. 
I haven’t told my parents and don’t plan to. The lady from the Health Department assures me that there are avenues to get medication for free. But my insurance is through my parents. 

I know I’ll feel better once I start medication. But I just need help and resources. 

Can anyone help me?

TL;DR - I’ve been diagnosed with HIV and I need help and resources to get the medication I need."

I'm not normally someone who hooks up at all, let alone have unprotected sex, but I just had a terrible lapse of judgment.

The guy I went on a date with last night was really sweet and trustworthy. We went for drinks and a bite to eat and ended up back at his place. I didn't expect to go further than a JO sesh at most but it ended up being full on bb sex, albeit only for 10ish seconds when I came to my senses and told him to stop.

He didn't ejaculate in me nor did I notice any cuts or bleeding, but he did have a good amount of precum. He told me he was negative the last time he got tested (a month and a half ago) and that he hasn't had any partners since, but I can't help but be a little paranoid. His last sexual encounter was in December (a month prior to his test), so couldn't he still have a potential strain in him to transmit?

Me being the bottom adds to my worries as the statistics I've found shows that bottoming has a much higher rate of transmission.

I want to ask him to go get tested with me but he has work and I don't want to be that guy. Should I suck it up and go to Planned Parenthood or an urgent care for pep? I'm terrified of the side effects but it'd be better than living with this constant state of panic..."

Yesterday I did one of those oraquick hiv tests. It came back positive. Like a lot of guys, hiv tests always scared the hell out of me. Though I took a lot of precaution, this all feels like totally my fault. 

I live in a rural area in Mississippi. I was desperately trying to get prep, but none of my doctors here knew anything about it. I was working with one of those online companies, but it’s apparently against the law in Mississippi to have these medications mailed to you. 

I was trying to pioneer ways for people in my area to get prep by trying everything. In my job I work with a lot of young gay men who also want prep, so I thought if I discovered a path I could share with them it could help protect them. 

But now I feel like a statistic. Like my body is tainted and infected. It wasn’t supposed to happen to me, you know? But here I am. Fortunately my partner of six years had a negative result on his. I know that doesn’t mean he’s out of the woods yet — but it’s a relief for now. 

I recently left my job in April to start my own business. Which means my health insurance will be running out soon — I can’t help but worry about what this means for me financially or if I’ll even be able to find a health insurer that won’t deny me for this new “pre-existing condition” I have. 

I feel so undesirable. So broken. 

I appreciate the opportunity to vent and be a little dramatic here. Aside from my partner, I have little to no gay friends due to the geographic area I’m in. I work in mental health, so most of the gay men I do interact with are clients of mine, so it’d be inappropriate to have friendships with them. It feels so isolating right now. 

It wasn’t supposed to be me. And you might feel like it won’t be you. But I hope you take my experience and know that it could be you, or any of us. Protect yourselves the best you can, friends. Take care."

&gt;  
&gt;**After eight years of follow-up of the so-called serodifferent couples, the study found no cases at all of HIV transmission within couples.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**The study proves, the researchers said, that using antiretroviral therapy to suppress the AIDS virus to undetectable levels also means it cannot be passed on via sex, the researchers said.**

&gt;**""Our findings provide conclusive evidence for gay men that the risk of HIV transmission with suppressive ART is zero,"" said Alison Rodger, a professor at University College London who co-led the research.**  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;The study, published in the Lancet medical journal on Thursday, assessed the risk of HIV transmission between serodifferent gay male couples - where one partner is HIV-positive and one is HIV-negative - who do not use condoms.  
&gt;  
&gt;Its findings add to an earlier phase of the study which looked at HIV transmission risk for serodifferent heterosexual couples in the same circumstances. It also found zero risk.  
&gt;  
&gt;**While 15 of the men among the 972 gay couples in this phase did become infected with HIV during the eight years of follow-up, genetic testing showed their infections were with strains of HIV acquired from another sexual partner.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Since the start of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, more than 77 million people have become infected with HIV. Almost half of them - 35.4 million - have died of AIDS.**

I'm really sexually inexperienced and had only had sex (topped) once in my life, and didn't cum either.

My second sexual experience happened on the weekend with a married couple after I'd been out drinking. I've never even liked the idea of a threesome so no idea why I agreed to go back with them.

There was penetration both ways but it wasn't until I woke up sober that I realised they didn't get a condom. Like wtf didn't it occur to me at the time?

I went to get PEP the day after but the only reassurance I have is that they've been married and exclusive for a long time and had only had a threeway themselves once, BUT it was a week ago... If they also went unprotected then and caught HIV, would it have been able to be passed to me in that time frame?

When he tried to top me, it hurt too much even just the tip so I instantly made him stop. But it made it bleed...

The other bottomed for me... well sat on me for about 30 seconds before getting off.

UGH. I pray that I haven't got anything bad from this, and if not it'll be a lesson forever.

Hopefully you can reassure this idiot."

When we were hooking up we flip fucked and it was fine, then when it came time for him to fuck me I asked if he could use a condom, he said “I’ll just tease your hole”. He then shoved the whole thing in but didn’t really do anything. He just left it there and we started making out. Then he takes it out and starts jerking for a minute, then he cums. I came a few times earlier that day so I was kind of tapped out, so I didn’t cum and we just parted ways. 

One thing to note is that we did use poppers a few times while fucking, so I’m not sure if that has any effect. I’m also not on prep since I’m still on my parents insurance (I’m 20) and they are very Christian and conservative so they would definitely never let me take it unless I payed for myself. I would then of course have to come out to them, so that’s a whole other issue. 

Anyway, it’s been two or three days since we hooked up and I feel slightly under the weather and I can’t help but worry a little bit about whether or not I contracted HIV. 

What do you guys think? Is it too soon to tell or should I not be worried about it since he is on prep? 

I think I’m still going to get a test but I just want to hear what you guys think. Thanks! :)"

Note that I have never had unprotected sex before in my life.

June 1st, I went to a gay bathhouse and I met this attractive 30 some year old there. We had fun with each other and he had a little bottle of poppers and I did it (only done that a few times before) and I got really really high for a bit. During that time, the guy started riding me bare and it felt really good. It was a total of about 30-40 seconds that I pulled out and I didn’t ejaculate.

I am getting nervous now. I have not talked about it to anyone and I am not on Prep. How soon can I get a HIV test and what are the chances of getting HIV from short bareback encounter?  All responses will be sincerely appreciated!"

It's an overwhelming feeling and I need to share somewhere safe.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 25 years old and I live in Portugal.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never had a real relationship, and I haven't tried in a while. For the past year I haven't been able to structure my life in a way that would allow me to manage a relationship. Lack of time and stress made it so I had no interest in even talking to anyone. But I focused on friends, work and school and I was fine. Lately some circumstances changed and I was finally opening up, talking to people again, having the occasional hookup.

&amp;#x200B;

This week I noticed my butthole was sore and it wasn't going away. Further inspection revealed what seemed like an herpes rash. The next open STD appointment was 4 days away and It was hurting to the point I couldn't sleep, so tonight at 4am I went to the ER.

&amp;#x200B;

The doctor confirmed the herpes diagnosis, and given the obvious risk behaviour he decided to run some blood work. I had been tested about 3 months ago and everything was fine. I went back in the morning to get the results from the doctor. I tested positive for HIV.

&amp;#x200B;

My hands are still shaking. I've read multiple times about how theses days the physical manifestation of the virus is perfectly manageable with one pill per day. The doctor herself told me that. I'm hoping that in a few months I'll be undetectable.

&amp;#x200B;

What scares me the most, is all the emotional part from now on. I've had some difficulty starting relationships in the past. How will I deal with this extra hurdle. How does life change in this regard.. I was hoping someone could share a little bit about their lives regarding HIV and romance and help me better understand the challenges ahead."

Started out with struggling to eat, every time I would eat something I would get a knot in my stomach that would cause nausea and discomfort. Then the body aches began, I was able to manage them with ibuprofen and Tylenol for a while until my body would reject them. These were not normal body aches, this was extreme pain that would keep up all night, when I would get pain pills to stay down I would be able to sleep for a couple hours just to woken up to night sweats. Dealing with this for about 2 weeks, I figured that it was time that I should go to the doctor.  

&amp;#x200B;

They started by taking a scan of my spine to figure out what was causing the pain, came back that there was some sort of infectious growth. They did another scan of the rest of the spine to make sure they hadn't missed anything, and they found that there was a second infection on my spine located on my neck and this one had a mass. Being a spinal infection, I was transferred to another hospital where there was a specialist, and ended up doing a biopsy on my neck.

&amp;#x200B;

They sent in the results, and in turn for about a week left we waiting in suspense on what it could be. They also in turn trying to eliminate suspect did standard blood test related to the symptoms, and early on discovered that HIV virus was present in the blood stream. Upon hearing those words and not knowing what else was coming my way, I was shocked.  Then after waiting for almost a week for the results to come back, turns out that I have cancer on top of having HIV.

&amp;#x200B;

I just moved out of my home state, and I have made only a few friends, so it feels like I'm dealing with the HIV side alone. I have told two good friends about it but I don't plan on telling my family until I get through the cancer treatment. so I guess why I'm writing this post is to get some thoughts out of my head, get some feedback and maybe support. I know that both of the things are treatable, so that is keeping my attitude pretty positive, but I'm just scared of when everything is going to hit like a train emotionally.

Today he messages me early in the morning, and just by the way he was sending the messages I knew something was bad. I was expecting the worst. My heart sank into my stomach.

I told him that he should have told me before, and not lie to me just BEFORE we were about to have UNPROTECTED sex. He says he doesn't remember that. I said I remember it word to word. And then he says ""I was just playing, I wouldn't have sex with you anyway"", which is an obvious lie. 

I told him I still intend to see him, but when I do, first I'll rant to him about lying to me because, what the fuck? How dare you make a decission for me if I'm going to sleep with you without me knowing your condition. Sure he cannot infect me because of the pills, but how do I know he's not lying about that? What if he's not taking his pills regularly?

He was so afraid I'd ditch him when he was texting me this morning but I'm an understanding person. I told him I JUST WANT TO BE SAFE. 

Also, I'm 21 years old, and he was my first partner, so if I managed to get HIV from him, I'd literally kill him. My immune system is already very very bad as it is, and all I need is him to kill me with HIV. 

Remember to stay safe, and ALWAYS use a condom. That night, I asked him if he has condoms because I was rethinking of having sex with him, but eventually I just decided to stick to my first decission."

“Tests that detect the p24 antigen generally have shorter window periods than tests that only detect antibodies. This is because most people have detectable levels of p24 antigen by 20 days after infection, which is generally earlier than antibodies can be detected. However, levels of p24 antigen in the blood begin to decrease three to four weeks after infection and are no longer detectable five to six weeks after infection. This is why fourth-generation HIV tests were designed to also detect anti-HIV antibodies, as antibodies generally remain detectable for the entire course of HIV infection.”
The issue is that I took my hiv test 35 days after unprotected sex which is roughly five weeks. Does this mean I still may have hiv?"

I texted him this morning and let him know that I'm here if he has any questions and that I will respect any decision he makes. 

I'm sad cuz we had such good chemistry before I told him this. Maybe I should have waited longer to tell him or maybe told him over text? We didn't have sex yet btw. I know he has never had any experience with hiv and what it all means to be undetectable (u=u) and I'm afraid I overwhelmed him. It's there anything I can do or say at this point? 

I'm also wondering if he decided he is not comfortable with it and breaks up. How should I tell someone about it next time I meet a date? Any tips from both side of relationship? If your partner is positive, how would you like to find out?"

This is extremely important.However, I’ve also noticed a lot of unkindness and vitriol towards people in our reddit community who are either ignorant about the issues, or are asking questions about HIV in a way that reveals maybe a different value set or ignorance towards HIV positivity. 
An example: in the Garrett Thomas thread, someone got downvoted multiple times for asking, “why don’t people just stay monogamous and always use protection.”
And while those of us with maybe a different or slightly more complicated view of the situation might interpret this as ignorant, I don’t think it’s right that people just kind of downvote without explanation. I don’t believe that the OP of that comment had ever had the chance to think about things in a different way, and it’s probably really confusing that people like him are being downvoted for what might otherwise  be considered “common sense” ideas.
What I’m saying is, don’t just downvote these people. A lot of the time, all it takes is a little bit of explanation. Sure- there will always be people who don’t understand, and believe strictly in monogamous/protected sex as a means of prevention. But if you disagree, I don’t think the answer is to downvote automatically, but try to engage in a way that allows you to discuss the issues in a meaningful way. 
The LGBTQ community is divided enough as it is. There’s no reason to bite back when we can work together to educate each other."

Backstory:

* I recently had unprotected sexual intercourse and was concerned about potentially being diagnosed with HIV.
* Many doctors seemed judgmental, but claimed they didn't really know enough about Truvada (medication to treat HIV) to prescribe it. The Urgent Care wouldn't even take me in, so I had to go to the Emergency Room.

&amp;#x200B;

Important Part:

Anyways, I went to the pharmacy and was told that AFTER insurance, it would've cost around $250 for Truvada and around $250 for Timicay for only 15 days worth of tablets. ($500 every two weeks = $13,000 per year!!)

I just wanted to let everyone know that Gilead (maker of Truvada and Timicay) has a coupon program where they will generally cover the copay (what regular insurance doesn't cover). There's no monthly limit and you shouldn't be able to hit the yearly limit unless your insurance doesn't cover enough.

**Bottom line: I was able to pay $0 for HIV meds. If you have HIV and are prescribed Truvada or Timicay, you can go to** [www.gileadadvancingaccess.com](https://www.gileadadvancingaccess.com) **to see if you're eligible for help!**

They have programs for people with or without insurance. Not sure about the non-insurance option since I have health insurance. They don't cover government health plans since usually the government provides almost all of the coverage itself.

Disclosure: I take full responsibility for my actions. It was just unfortunate that regular doctors wouldn't prescribe the meds for me. Also, I get nothing for providing the link. Just trying to be helpful. :) You can look it up on a search engine if you prefer (rather than clicking the link).

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: If this isn't allowed, please let me know. I just didn't want anyone to pay more than they have to if they're in a similar situation."

There is - what I would call - a sad part of the gay world that wants to get HIV. They talk about how -even worse- they like spreading it.

Have they given up hope? They seem to often have untreated mental illness.  They say they're dumping their HIV meds and hope more unsuspecting twinks will get pozzed.

I just think it's sad that those that got HIV say back in the 80s 90s etc or even some recently and want/wanted to live, didn't survive. Yet there is what I call a warped part of society that wants it, and wants to waste away etc and spread it. Some guys do things to deliberately make their anal area susceptible to infection. Very odd

I don't 100% trust gay guys re their status or if they say they're neg and or neg on prEP.

It’s been about a week since then and I’ve just been worried to death about it since it was a casual hookup. My groin has been hurting a bit on the sides, but I don’t see any visible swollen lymph nodes but I don’t have any fever, or sore throat. 

Am I overblowing this by thinking I’ve been exposed to HIV? Super worried here 😰"

How did the Democrats react to the statement? [They are harshly critical, of course](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-world-aids-day-budget_n_5de42205e4b0d50f32a42bc4?utm_campaign=hp_fb_pages&amp;utm_source=main_fb&amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;ncid=fcbklnkushpmg00000063&amp;fbclid=IwAR2YIRcq-vc_D2_O-Q2KuVgPnhMc1AKv_hgAHz8mBe07dYsvzTdKcf7x4Is). The Democratic National Committee said that Trump is “no ally of people living with HIV, who are disproportionately LGBTQ and people of color.” To translate it from political-hypocritical into plain English, Trump is yet again called a racist -- because there are “people of color” who suffer most from HIV, and a homophobe and transphobe – for the same reason.

Then comes a bizarre “explanation” of this statement: “His \[Trump\] administration has proposed cutting global HIV-prevention programs and attacked health care services that people living with HIV rely on, including the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, and Planned Parenthood,” DNC Chairman Tom Perez, DNC Disability Council Chairman Tony Coelho and DNC LGBTQ Caucus Chairman Earl Fowlkes said in a joint statement.

As is usually the case with Democratic rhetoric, there are some major gaps in its logic, making it simply fallacious, and, therefore, leading to the wrong conclusions.

First, while indeed the Trump administration has proposed slashing the budget for the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) by almost 24 percent, with particularly steep cuts to humanitarian aid, refugee assistance, and global health programs, it is only a half-truth about the Administration’s policy on HIV/AIDS.

I’ve never been with a guy, never kissed a guy, and I next to never have been in a situation where I’ve flirted with one. But as of recently I’d decided to try to and get over that and have been talking to a couple of guys on tinder who live in my area. I’ve been talking to two guys for a couple weeks now and I think I finally want to meet up with one of them and lose my virginity.

The thing is, even though I will be using condoms, I’m worried about getting caught up in the moment and doing something stupid. I’m worried about giving someone a blowjob that I don’t know and getting gonorrhoea or worse HIV (I know the risk of getting HIV through oral is incredibly low but I still have to worry about STD/STI’s). 

All of this mixed in with the fact that I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder is just making this whole thing so much worse. I’m not scared of being assaulted or not in control, I’m just scared of the loud voice in my head that says “What if?. Sure, have fun now but is that worth the weeks of anticipation before you can get tested and then a lifetime of medication on top of the 7 and a half pills a day you already take for your mental illness!”

This is more of a rant/asking for your opinions post. I wanna be sexually active and safe, but I also wanna give one person a blowjob without thinking my throat is gonna be riddled with herpes or I’m gonna get HIV. I also know I don’t have to do the hookup thing, I don’t have to do anything I don’t want to. But I really wanna give a blowjob and not think the absolute worst."

You only have one partner, right?” I said that I am seeing several guys and my primary physician feels that it is recommended for me to be on it. When the doctor left the room briefly, I had to do a quick, slightly embarrassing, explanation of what PrEP is and what it dies to prevent HIV. Fortunately she chose not to ask many questions. She is smart. She can read between the lines. 

Unfortunately this is the third time I have seen a medical professional who immediately jumped to that conclusion without bothering to look at my chart which does not say anything about HIV on it. Why would a doctor be that unthinking about talking about that when my mother is sitting with me? It is a good thing that my mother ceased to he embarrassed about me awhile ago.

I have not had any sexual encounters since. Almost immediately after this sexual encounter, I developed an intense fear that I had been infected with HIV. 

I had three tests that all tested for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV: 10 days after encounter, one month after encounter, and finally, six months after encounter. My general practitioner specifically told me that if anything showed up in my results, they'd call me in. As they didn't call me in for any of the three tests, all tests are to be assumed negative.

Unfortunately for me, these negative results didn't stop HIV-related anxiety. Since my 3rd and final test, I have had a persistent fear that I may have been infected anyways and not know it. What if my doctor is intentionally or mistakenly withholding this information from me? What if there was an issue with my tests? What if the results weren't sent to my doctor? What if there was some other unknown issue? Because of this, I fear my tests were erroneous even though I should know better.

I'm able to deal with anxiety better than I was able to even a year ago, but I haven't been able to shake this feeling that I may have been infected and not know it. I know that anxiety can cause this sort of thing to happen, yet I'm powerless to stop it. Does anyone have any advice for me?"

Detailed Summary (or just read the article lol):

* Who:  Adam Castillejo is still **free of the virus more than 30 months after stopping anti-retroviral therapy.**
* How:  **Stem-cell transplants appear to stop the virus being able to replicate** inside the body by replacing the patient's own immune cells with donor ones that resist HIV infection. Specifically,  ""CCR5 is the most commonly used receptor by HIV-1 - the virus strain of HIV that dominates around the world - to enter cells. But a very small number of people who are resistant to HIV have two mutated copies of the CCR5 receptor. This means the virus cannot penetrate cells in the body it normally infects.""
* My first question was, is he just undetectable like current, more widespread treatments can manage, or is he actually cured? : ""The tests suggest 99% of Mr Castillejo's immune cells have been replaced by donor ones. But he still has remnants of the virus in his body, as does Mr Brown. **And it is impossible to say with absolute certainty his HIV will never come back**.""
   * this is a little confusing to me, because the article says they can't detect HIV in his semen, blood or tissues, but then they are talking about remnants of HIV remaining. How are they declaring can't detect HIV in his body, but at the same time detecting it? Regardless, it kind of reminds me of the cold sore virus herpes, where the virus will lay dormant but we can't be sure if it might ""wake up"" again.
* Will the treatment come into widespread use? ""**it will not be a treatment for the millions of people around the world living with HIV**. The aggressive therapy was primarily used to treat the patients' cancers, not their HIV. And current HIV drugs remain very effective, meaning people with the virus can live long and healthy lives. Prof Gupta said: ""**It is important to note that this curative treatment is high-risk and only used as a last resort for patients with HIV who also have life-threatening haematological malignancies**. ""Therefore, this is not a treatment that would be offered widely to patients with HIV who are on successful anti-retroviral treatment."" **But it might offer hope of finding a cure, in the future, using gene therapy.**""

Even though the story has a good ending, I still have guilt over it and I realise that I need to address some issues with my partner. This story is built on Mistakes because looking back I did not make any single move that was right until the very end.

**Mistake 1: Cheating
**

The story started 8 months ago when I had an oral exposure outside of my relationship. This happened after a busy night of drinking and snorting cocaine. I was giving the BJ and the guy came in my mouth which I spat out after few seconds. Now you need to know, when I drink and take drugs I usually get a lot of ulcers and I chew up my lips and tongue pretty badly. It's disgusting and painful the next day. Anyway, in the following weeks I did not think too much of this event and went on with my life.

**Mistake 2: Having casual sex with my partner
**

About three weeks later something very unusual happened, my boyfriend initiated sex (which has not happened in a long long time) and I went with, but without informing him about the cheating incident. I also did I initiate to use protection because that would have been weird. (And now I know why so many professionals recommend condoms even for supposed committed relationships!)

**Mistake 3: Obsessive Googling
**

Then came quarantine and I started noticing weird rashes on my feet after showering (now I admit these were probably always there, I just never noticed). Then about 6 weeks post-exposure I developed a case of seborrheic dermatitis. Now this was definitely not just fantasy as I still have pictures of it (although it's self-diagnosed). Proper large scales with red patches underneath. As the quarantine went on I kept Googling the possible causes until I arrived to the famous connection between SebDerm and HIV. From this point things went mentally out of control. I spent the good part of the last 6 months obsessing. Googling of studies, statistics, anecdotal evidence and all possible Reddit threads on topics like:

- higher chance of oral transmission with cocaine
- chances of HIV transmission if I chew my lips when taking cocaine
- How long after HIV transmission Seborrheic dermatitis appears
- Do men in their 30's seborrheic dermatitis 
- severity of Seborrheic dermatitis after HIV transmission
- and literally hundreds of similar others...

This Googling obsession did teach me a lot of useful stuff, but the bigger impact was that I fully convincingly diagnosed myself as an HIV patient. At the same time I was paralysed and coming up excuses as to why NOT to get tested. In my head I got infected through cheating AND also infected my partner. I literally cringed every time I heard him sneeze or complain about backaches. To me it was all HIV symptoms.

**Mistake 4: Driving myself to full blown panic
**

Very recently the situation escalated so severely that I practically did not eat or sleep for a full week. I made up numerous scenarios as to how to tell my partner about the issue, how to get tested, how to sell the house and move on with our lives. Who's going to keep the dog and will the other one pay an allowance? Can I even go on with life after this total moral failure? In this moment I understood the supposed meaning of 'Headspace' because I had literally none. Not in my dreams nor in waking life. A total mess.

**Resolution: getting help and getting tested
**

A week ago for the first time I finally spoke to someone that is not myself. It was a phone helpline and I can't be grateful enough for the guy who took the call, because was incredibly patient and helped me to see myself from the outside for a moment. I was still sure of my positive status, but I gained some suspicion that I might be wrong. After this I also called an old friend who I knew I could trust and it also helped a lot in coming to terms with the situation and the possible outcomes. Both conversations ended on the note that there's no other way forward, but getting tested. I looked up a nice-looking, gay-friendly clinic and asked them a few questions over the phone. When I arrived I was not sure if I would take the test. It took a total of two hours of chatting with two different people. They could not have been nicer and more patient. I was still a mess, telling them all my theories and internet knowledge (I imagine it must be really annoying, but I had to hear what they had to say about my 'findings'.) They were both quite convinced that I was not being rational and chances of a positive test were really low and probably zero. Basically they said there has never had a pure oral transmission in this city. The more interesting part is that they spoke to me about the process in case I do have HIV and how it would be living with it. It suddenly did not seem so scary. At least the positive vs negative outcome did not seem like two polar extremes. More like an ideal scenario and an alternative. I apologised to them if my fear was disrespectful to any HIV patients and of course they reassured me that it was OK. I arrived as a mess, but felt like sobering up by the end. And also being somewhat OK with either outcome.

By the time we got to the test i felt surprisingly relaxed and confident. It turns out the test result was negative and while I definitely prefer this result, I gained some understanding and acceptance of the alternative outcome. I can't be thankful enough for the people who helped me get through this mess. And I gained a new appreciation for what I have in life too. I feel it was a much needed exercise to put things into perspective.

The next step for me is to come clear with my partner and decide where to take the relationship.

My advice would be to everyone, don't try to correct a mistake with another one. Don't waste your or anybody's time. I feel like I was robbed off nearly 8 months of my life due to being in 24/7 mental prison. It should not have been so bad if I did the right thing early on."

So I havent really been on a date in ages because of self esteem issues, COVID and to be frank... i'm kind of a picky bitch because I have reached that age where I am thinking about meeting up dudes in regards to whether I would want to date and marry them rather than a quick hook-up. During the pandemic, I had some body issues so I deleted grindr for 6 months and lost 40 pounds. After I got back on grinder, within a week I was talking this this absolutely gorgeous guy who was a bit younger than me. Their life was a bit of a mess, they were one of those incredibly hot guys who were modest and didnt think they were cute and liked being called cute. They were also a massive nerd so for me it was like, +1 +1 to a lot of their qualities. We ended up on a date for 12 hours and near the end I was teasing the hell out of them and we ended up fooling around in basically every way imaginable. About an hour after I drove them home they sent me the dreaded message... they were HIV positive.

Naturally I freaked up but tried to remain calm around them. I can't really risk contracting HIV at the moment because of 3 things. 1, I have medical issues and I was recently hospitalize for having a nose bleed for an hour and vomiting blood. 2, I work with kids and it would be a huge disaster if one bit me and as a male I'd run the risk of the whole sexual assault thing. and 3, I have a messed up immune system. So I told them ""thank you for telling me almost immediately because this is an incredibly serious thing, especially with me. Im upset you told me after because I would have been able to prepare myself better healthwise to be safe. And thank you for being honest about your condition rather than keeping it hidden. Long story short, I went to the county clinic the next day, was forced to make an appointment the day after because the hospitals are a mess because of COVID, went in, my RN chewed out the lady making appointments as mine was urgent, and they sent me to the hospital. Right now I am on day 5 of 28 days of prep. 

The guy told me he is undetectable and gave me a lecture about U = U, but at the same time... I felt incredibly suspicious of him because he told me AFTER we fooled around. and the after part just made it too risky. Like he is a cool guy and we have a lot of similar interests, but for medical reasons I'd have to slow it down a bit and get on PREP first to feel comfortable and maintain my HIV negative status. At the very least, help reduce my own anxiety about HIV by providing myself a sense of control over it. I talked with the RN's at the clinic and I just feel like a mess. I like the guy a lot, but I am just livid about what he did."

Hey guys 

firstly this isn't an ad, just an awesome show I'd love to share 

I just watched all 5 episodes of [‘It’s A Sin](https://twitter.com/redproductionco/status/1339604396812996608?s=21) a new gay drama that focuses on some late teen/ early 20-something gays/queers navigating their lives and sexuality in 1980s London, as a mysterious illness (HIV/AIDS) begins to spread through the LGBT community. The show was written by Russell T Davies (writer of Queer as Folk &amp; Cucumber), so if you do decide to watch you're in good hands. 

The drama works so well because it doesn't paint this period with one shade of doom, death and gloom, but rather takes a deep dive into the varying attitudes of those who lived through it and those who unfortunately couldn't. From denial to conspiracy, activism, and campaigning. This could be viewed as almost a coming of age series for gays who are forced to develop at a later stage in life.  We watch how the nuanced characters try to manage their romantic/sexual desires and a lingering fear that echos louder and louder as the narrative develops. It's packed with hedonism, pain, laughter, lust, tears and 80s music staples!

As a 23(m) I believe I live in a time where we are *somewhat* over the hurdle in terms of HIV/AID- what I mean is it no longer being a complete death sentence (I acknowledge there is a lot of work to still do). Obviously, I don't know what this time was really like, but what was highlighted to me was 'people ACTUALLY  lived through this'! Silly I know. It just made it seem less distant and removed...Like these people lived, loved, fought, danced whatever it might be and some died very young maybe alone...leaving families, friends, lovers etcetera. And kinda made me realise the rate at which this was happening- friend groups shrinking and the lack of action taken by leaders. However, as frank and tragic as the drama is, it’s also a celebration of life! The lives lived, lost and forgotten of a generation that was decimated by prejudice, fear and illness.

And he apparently came inside me but I saw nothing and ge said it was not much cause he jacks off a lot. Anyways, we later went for round 2, he wore another condom but it didn't break that time. Btw I had to really ask him to always put one on cause you could tell he likes to do it raw, even in the second round of it all we just ended it mid way cause I wasn't feeling it anymore(I didn't get hard all night but it was prob cause of the anxiety or cause it was all so new to me) and he said he wasn't close to finishing cause of the condom and how it's not doing the job for him. But anyways, he dropped me off at home and on the way I asked when was the last time he was tested which I should have asked earlier obv but I didn't cause he always said he is not sexually active and I am the first guy he has had ever sexually and I sadly trusted him. He said he hasn't gotten tested recently cause there is no point if he is not sexually active. Anyways I was dropped off and that's when it hit me, what happened, the condom breaking, everything. This is all so new to me and I was paranoid as hell, he was literally my first kiss, oral and anal encounter, he was my first everything. I was sweating that night and idk if it's cause of the wine or the anxiety or cause I caught something. The next day I went to work and was still super worried and was sooo tired, and had an emotional breakdown at work and started crying cause I swore I caught something so I clocked out and went home. I couldn't even go to any clinic cause they were closed and it was a Saturday, I felt sooo hopeless and doomed. I then went to the clinic on monday only to find out that's not where you get the tests done and I have to make an appointment cause clearly std's wait till you make the appointments to then harm you(stupid health care system) so I made the call and apparently I have to pay cause I have no Medicaid or any thing. But gotta go next monday. So here I am already feeling so anxious and paranoid and also angry and searching up symptoms every 3 secs. And all this week I have been feeling sooo tired(like I never have before) my arms feel weak and tired even after waking up from bed. I have some small aches in my back, neck and shoulder area, feel so weak and weird in my chest area and arms and even my head feels weird and heavy but it's not a headache at all so it's odd. But I am scared it could eventually turn into one. It's like I feel ill but have no fever so it's all so odd. And I hve been crying so much and staring at every little thing that feels like a symptom. And I swear it feels like everyday I have one. Like I just feel horrible and doomed. Even today I woke up kinda itchy in parts and am scared I will get rash. I feel like I am in hell. I cannot handle all this stress. And the ill kinda feeling isn't helping me feel any better. Can someone please help me with some info or reassurance idk :( this was literally my first sexual encounter and I feel like I am 4ever doomed now. Please help.

I forgot to mention the guy blocked me the next day cause I confronted him about how I felt and he assumed I was calling him sick and said he was offended at what I was telling him and he blocked me. So I am also dealing with the heartbreak through all of this."

I don't get it. How can two HIV negative men just somehow produce HIV just by having sex? Unless it originates somewhere else and a gay man accidentally caught it and spread it. If that's the case then the issue would not be gay sex but rather promiscuity."

I'm a new inexperienced bi-curious man, I have had only one sexual encounter with a man 8 months ago ( it included a condomless receptive anal intercourse I was the bottom)..



After two weeks of this encounter, I underwent this pcr test (which they told me it's conclusive at 14 days but I'm having a hard time believing that) and it turned out negative..


After a month of this encounter, I took the pcr test again and it's negative again, and the doctor told me it was not necessary and you're negative..



Now and after 8 months of this encounter, I'm having a sore throat but with no fever, so I went to the clinic again and asked them to take the ""hiv antibody test"" and now I'm waiting for my results which will be ready after 12 hours..



My question is, do you guys think my status will still be negative? 
Have any of you underwent the pcr test before? 
And last question is the sore throat a definite sign of hiv?"

So the other day I did something incredibly stupid. I got intoxicated and before the night was over I was on Scruff trying to get somebody to come over and relief my sexual needs. After several messages this guy had agreed to come cover and we just engaged in oral sex. During the event, I noticed that his mouth started to bleed because I was going hard and he said he bit his tongue. No anal sex was done, but just the fact that I had his blood on my penis (I had shaved prior he came over) I been extremely paranoid that I may have contacted an STD or even HIV. I know I shouldnt just “assuming” his status. So I reached out and the guy was nice enough to carry a conversation about his status. He mentioned that he was negative and has been on PreP for the last four months. He even showed me his negative status that showed him being negative a month ago. Can someone please tell me I’m overreacting? At this point I can’t seem to get myself together. I’m not sexually active at all, and just by doing this I’m beginning to question myself. It feels like I can’t concentrate or do anything cause my mind is taking control of me at this point. I’m sorry if I have offended anyone to blatantly prove that the stigma is still around. I’m a premed student and if I ever make it to medical school I’m going to become an advocate for HIV patients.

ot0s33,Thesis: You are more likely to contract HIV from someone who says he is Neg than from someone who says he is Poz,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/ot0s33/thesis_you_are_more_likely_to_contract_hiv_from/,huntersays0,1,2021-07-27 19:21:49,82,/r/gaybros/comments/ot0s33/thesis_you_are_more_likely_to_contract_hiv_from/,NaN,"Hear me out before you tell me I’m crazy.  We know the following things are true - 

1. U = U.  (Gay bros should know what that means. If you don’t know what that means google it, I’m not putting a link out of spite.)
2. The vast majority of HIV+ people can become undetectable. https://www.hiv.gov/blog/when-undetectable-unachievable-study-offers-insights-hiv-persistence
3. The vast majority of people who don’t become undetectable are those who fail to stay in and comply with treatment. https://www.sfaf.org/collections/beta/undetectable-your-burning-questions-answered/
4. The vast majority of people who become undetectable stay undetectable. https://www.sfaf.org/collections/beta/almost-but-not-quite-hiv-undetectable-is-that-a-problem/
5. Even if you miss multiple doses every week you will likely stay undetectable as long as there is no prolonged lack of treatment. https://www.poz.com/article/can-hiv-treatment-taken-just-4-days-week
6. HIV is most infectious in the weeks after infection, when you’re least likely to know you have it. https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids

Now, think about the characteristics of a person who discloses immediately (i.e., in the profile or before you go home with him) that he’s HIV+.  That disclosure makes it far less likely for him to have sex.  And lying about being HIV- is essentially costless if he’s just looking for a hookup - it’s basically unverifiable unless you ask him for papers or raid his medicine cabinet for oxy and find biktarvy. So the only reason a guy would disclose he is HIV+ is because he cares more about you, a random stranger, and your right to know his HIV status, than his own desire to get drilled.  (Yes, he’s a bottom, there’s no such thing as tops.)  

Now, how likely do you think it is that this scrupulously honest person is so poorly adherent to treatment that he could be infectious and not know it?  Even if he didn’t care about you, he’d still take his pills to save his own life. And people who take their pills don’t (or at least very rarely) magically become infectious after becoming undetectable. And even if he experienced treatment failure, he would learn about it within a few months, since HIV+ folks who are in treatment get blood work multiple times per year. 

And then, think about those HIV+ people who know they are positive, but still are infectious. We know the vast majority are not adherent to treatment.  (Truly not trying to shit on my brothers with treatment resistant strains - I love you and you’re perfect.) Someone who isn’t adherent to treatment for something that invariably will kill him, when the treatment is widely and freely/cheaply available in essentially every western nation, even in the USA where a pregnancy costs more than a Porsche.  Do you think that guy is scrupulously disclosing on his Grindr profile that he’s HIV+? 

Finally, it’s been well accepted for years that you are more likely to contract HIV from someone who doesn’t know he’s positive (and thus obviously couldn’t disclose) than someone who does. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21928097/  I’m not saying everyone who says they’re negative is lying, but we do know lots of them are unaware they’re positive. 

So although it’s difficult to test epidemiologically, I’d be willing to bet that you’re more likely to contract HIV if he says he’s negative than if he says he’s positive. Ok, now tell me how stupid I am."
