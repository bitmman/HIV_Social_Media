f7tik,Who here is living with HIV? What's your story?,http://www.reddit.com/r/hivaids/comments/f7tik/who_here_is_living_with_hiv_whats_your_story/,Monyet,10,2011-01-23 18:51:57,14,/r/hivaids/comments/f7tik/who_here_is_living_with_hiv_whats_your_story/,NaN,"My wife and I were only diagnosed recently - late last year. She was taken into hospital with what turned out to be toxoplasmosis encephalitis and so was tested for HIV. She had extremely low CD4 levels (55) and an extremely high viral load (5.7 million!)

My CD4 levels were around the 350 mark so we both started treatment pretty sharpish.

Looking back, I'm pretty sure I picked up the virus around 5 years ago. I was sleeping around a lot back then, and remember coming down with a mystery illness which included fever, swollen lymph nodes and a white coating on my throat. I did worry form time to time about a possible HIV infection but comforted myself by telling myself that if it was likely the doctors would have suggested a test. 

Although I'm originally from the UK we live in a developing country. The basic medicine is free but hospital visits and tests are expensive. Also the treatment here is more limited than it would be in the UK. For example my wife is currently on stavudine which I know is no longer recommended by the WHO. Also the doctor is not very forthcoming with information, he didn't even talk to us about possible side effects of any of the medicine.

We are considering a move back to the UK, but it's not that simple. We have jobs, housing, friends and our pet cat here to consider!

Anyway, that's my story so far in a short rambling post. Sorry if it's not that interesting but the process is really a cathartic exercise. If anyone has any questions I'll be happy to add more info. Also, it would be great if others shared their stories."

In college I was premed and learned about the disease and how it affects cells. Immunology was something I really enjoyed, and this disease that tears down your immune system was something I was very interested in. Though I completed all my premed requirements, I chose to move to LA to become a filmmaker, for better or for worse (probably worse). Since then, I have been wanting to make a film, not about the science behind it, but the ramifications socially/emotionally etc of learning that you have HIV. Another reason I find HIV so interesting is that it's not a disease that you can just get by being next to someone, the disease is often transferred via a willful act, so I can imagine that questions of responsibility often come up. These are things that I'm interested in exploring further. I really want to put authentic emotion into this film, and because I do not have HIV, I cannot use my own experiences.

Though my story is about a heterosexual family, I cannot imagine that the feelings might be any different.

So, if you are willing, I would love to hear your story, and do my best to translate it into film.

If you wouldn't mind talking to me, please PM me. Everything you say will of course be kept in the strictest of confidence, you don't even have to tell me your name.

Thank you.

Also if you guys have any ideas of where to cross post this I would appreciate that as well.

2 weeks ago, I made a terrible mistake and went home with somebody I met at a bar. It was post break-up, alcohol induced, and not my finest moment. I bottomed, he wore a condom, but I remember looking down at one point and he had taken the condom off. I freaked out, left and walked home alone. He did not finish, but there was direct contact for a while. 

2 days later, I get a massive case of strep throat and fever. The strep clears up with antibiotics, but ever since the strep has been gone i've had constant nausea for about 8 days. 

I want to get an HIV test but I know it's pointless with it being only 2 weeks after the experience. I've been instructed to wait about 4-6 weeks to make sure the test is accurate. Also, my doctor doesn't know whats wrong with me and I'm trying probiotics so I've already sought medical attention. I'm just terrified because I've never had constant nausea like this, and my bacterial infection I got 2 days after the sex is freaking me out. 

My question is, is it likely these are early symptoms of HIV? Is it likely that any amount of precum could infect me, and is it possible to show symptoms 2 days after exposure? Those both don't seem likely to me, but I've never had symptoms like this before. Any help would be greatly appreciated. "

The blood tests were taken 8 weeks after the incident. How likely is it that these results are accurate? If I was having symptoms a mere 5 days after the incident, and the test was 7 weeks later, would it have likely shown up as positive? Or is it highly likely that the test wouldn't be positive until much later down the road?

EDIT:

Symptoms were as follows:

5 days after the incident I had a severe case of white spots on tonsils, high fever, aches, pains, etc. Went on antibiotics and it went away. After the infection cleared, I had a weird nausea feeling in my stomach and was very tired. Then, I started having diarrhea about 2 weeks in. For the past 4-5 weeks, Ive had severe fatigue, very weird stools that go back and forth between dirrhea and thin, mucusy stools. I'm still very tired all the time and have some joint/muscle aches every now and then. The most noticable symptom is a bloating in my stomach and the loose stools.

I did some stool cultures with my doc, they came back okay. Then I got the HIV and Hepatitis blood tests 8 weeks in, they just came back negative. I still don't feel right, and have been battling whatever I'm sick with for a total of 7 weeks now.

not sure if this is really the right place to be asking or talking about such things, but i'm getting myself a little worked up over stressing about this.
so last month i met a guy and we had unprotected anal sex on two occasions (fucking stupid i know, but i trusted the guy), i was active both times and didn't come inside. well a few days after we were talking and it came out that he is hiv+ and has known about it for about a year and a half. i freaked out. i didn't know what to think, i'm not educated in this area enough. he tried to calm me down saying that he was on antiretrovirals and his virus wasn't 'active' anymore. i'm fairly sure it doesn't work this way, but he said his doctor said that the risk is extremely low and that he has firends who have been together 5 years with the passive guy being + and the active remaining - even though they don't use protection.
I really have no idea about the ease with which hiv infection occurs.
i am getting the test on monday, but i know that it takes up to three months for the test to be accurate..
give it to me straight, am i fucked?"

I don't know what the acceptance requirements would be. I don't know what the moderation should be like. I just know that I have no one where I live that I can express myself openly about my illness and have honest and frank conversations without repercussions... and that's something that I think would help me on my own recovery and potentially help others here. I'm very interested in other opinions and possibilities on the idea.

I am a member of some other private subreddits, and while they are not highly active, they allow one to express yourself very openly to a group that you know can relate... and that has been very therapeutic for me on other levels.

I don't want to slight this subreddit, this is a great place for information. I just don't feel comfortable sharing some things in such an open forum."

I have a job offer in Ontario, Toronto specifically.  I want to move there.  This job offer would represent an 8% salary increase and a career advancement.  
  
I've discovered that Ontario has no HIV drug coverage whatsoever (unless I was disabled or on welfare).  Without coverage, my meds come in at $1400/month, no generic options available (Isentress and Truvada).  
  
My work does have insurance, though it only covers to 80% of the medication cost.  To change my plan, I have to wait until January (the other available plan is 90%).  They let me change my plan if there is a major life incident... but only within 31 days of said incident.  Since I didn't adjust it at the time of diagnosis, that window has closed.  
  
With the increased cost of living (rent, specifically) and the additional cost of medication in Ontario, my move will be a net loss of several thousand dollars per year.  This seems absurd to me.  
  
I'm at wits end.  Moving to Ontario would be a bad financial decision.  But I can't stay in Alberta, I am miserable here.  
  
I am stunned at how shoddy and inconsistent HIV medication coverage is across this country.  I pretty well have to figure out what I am doing in the next 2 days.  
  
Anyone else experience this?

Only thing that bothers me is 
1- Obviously a worker in that industry contains a higher risk of having HIV
2-Im not sure what type of condom it was. It was out of the wrapper on a towel when she came back into the room.
3-Clarity of test at 7 weeks. 

I dont know the accuracy percentage of this test. But would like insight. This was exactly at 7 weeks. My encounter was on 7/16. test on 9/3

I'm not sure if this is the correct place, but considering it's World AIDS Day, I thought it might've been appropriate. 

In a total lapse of judgement, I performed unprotected oral sex on a guy back in July. There was no ejaculation, but from what I recall, there was precum involved. I didn't know anything about his HIV status (except for just his word), but assumed the worst for a long time. Towards the end of October (about 3 months since the encounter), I had the finger prick rapid HIV test performed and it returned a negative result (as well as for all other STDs). I was relieved to say the least. 

But now, after doing research, I'm not sure if I'm out of the woods. From what I've read and if I understood it properly, it can take 6 months to appear?

Should I still be worried? There was no other sex act performed aside from the unprotected oral sex, and he didn't ejaculate. I haven't had any other sexual partners since, or any other form of unprotected contact. I don't know if this is just nerves taking over or if I do really have a cause for concern still?

The HIV counselor at the clinic where I was tested said I should be fine, and that a 6-month retest wouldn't be necessary because there was no penetrative act performed and no ejaculate present. And that even if he had ejaculated in my mouth, I would have to move manually it onto an open sore (if I had one) and leave it there in order to really be at risk. I mentioned the precum to him and he said that it wasn't possible to contract HIV via that (which contradicts everything I've read) and that more than likely, what I encountered was a fluid that leaks out to clean the urethra to prepare it for ejaculation.

The scariest thought I have, though, is that, after the encounter was over, I asked for a glass of water (after rinsing my mouth out in the restroom) and he left the room for a long few minutes, and that in that time, he would've ejaculated into the glass of water before giving it to me or something because he is a crazed HIV spreader? ಠ_ಠ (I'm hoping my mind is just running away with me on this one). I mean, I met the guy off of cl so I didn't know him, and afterwards, I just kept assuming the worst.

The irony in all of this is that I never have unprotected sex. I'm always adamant to my friends and family that they need to protect themselves to be safe. I've prided myself in being knowledgeable about safe sex. And I've never done anything like this with a stranger. So the whole thing terrifies me. 

So any advice, kind redditors? I'm sorry to have rambled. But I appreciate any and all responses. 

Thanks. "

I have seen that there can be a great deal of anxiety while in the lurch of test results and I would like to think I can help some.


I'm HIV negative, though for two weeks I had a test result that said I otherwise. I went to Planned Parenthood to get a rash on my groin looked at, turned out it be just an allergic reaction to some materials from work. While there I figured I would get tested for HIV for the first time, no big deal I thought. I have had a handful of partners, and only once had unprotected sex. I'm about as low of a risk as a mid twenties male can be, short of abstinence. I took a quick result mouth swab test. I was content to walk out the door before the result came back, but they stopped me while leaving and said that they couldn't discern the result, i.e., it is not clearly negative.

I was stunned. They asked me back into the exam room to draw blood. They said several times that it's not a big deal. They told me that there was a 90% chance that it was a false positive. Not surprisingly, I focused on the 10% chance that I was indeed positive. While simultaneously wondering why in the hell they would use a test that, if they weren't lying, was terribly unreliable. If there were lying, they were trying to comfort me until the blood test came back. I just sat there, unable to reason my way out of the situation, thinking that this is how people are told that they have HIV. It turned out I was negative two weeks later but in that moment I felt some sense of peace. There was nothing in the world I could do to either know if I had just taken a unreliable test or if they were comforting me and granting me two weeks before handing me a positive blood test.

It was no holiday waiting two weeks, considering I have essentially no support network. No family, and at the time, only one pretty close friend who was one of my sexual partners. She was the only person I told and thankfully supportive. I came to realize that for me, my anxiety was not a result of, nor would be fixed by the  result. Since even if it was positive I would have been positive for months or years already at that point. In that time there were many good days that weren't affected at all, and that could continue to happen. I mostly felt fear and sadness for possibly exposing partners, people I cared about, to hiv. I think those two emotions were the source of the mild depression and paralyzing anxiety I felt at times. I was, to a mild degree of success, able to stay functioning and not worry all too much about the result.


I personally think that HIV tests themselves can neither cause not solve your anxiety, though I can certainly relate to it's presence at the time. By the end of the two weeks I was ready for either answer, I 100% wanted to know if I was positive to, at the very least, inform my past partners. In the end being negative was a wake up call to transgressions in my life that I was not happy with and ignoring. In any case, talk to a friend or a trained therapist/counselor if you are having a troubles coping. And remember to breathe. 

Possible cause of the false positive: I was offered a dum-dum lollipop by the receptionist. I reasoned that might have been the case as my then partner was told to not put anything in her mouth besides water, for at least an hour before her oral swab. I received no such caution and it's possible that the candy threw off the test.

While I know everyone situation is different, I hope this was worth reading, sorry for making it so long, I wish I could figure a way to more concisely relate the story. I'm happy to answer any questions."

This is somewhat of a continuation from the first post that I did.

So I finally got to meet up with my partner yesterday for the first time in real life since disclosing to him about my newly found status. It was a double date with two of my other friends who also acted as a support system in case I needed it.

So we went to the MET in the city and he seemed to be enjoying my company, even holding hands almost the entire time while there. However when I tried to chance it and moved in for a kiss on his cheek, he seemed to not like it too much, for which all I could do is apologize. The original plan was to roam the museum, and then go outside to Central Park closeby in order to really discuss where our relationship was going. However, knowing that he had to leave somewhat early and mentioning how he wouldn't need much time to talk about it with me, that sent so many red flags off in my head, to which I told him that we need to go outside and talk now then.

So we go out still holding hands and find a bench where we can finally let it all out. I start talking to him first, basically explaining how my status dosen't mean I've changed, how I'm still the same person through and through and how as long as I take my medication, I'll live just as long as I would've being negative. He starts to get really emotional, talking about how he knows all this already from reading articles online. He starts crying with his head to his knees, talking about all the stress and paranoia he's felt because of this, and how he tried taking the date to see if he can still see me the same way he did before my HIV results. He said that he just couldn't do it, and feels that it's best if we just end it, while being emotional, crying, and constantly saying how sorry he is.

Whether I'm being selfish I'm not, I hug him, telling him how he shouldn't be sorry for how he feels and how I personally feel like that he needs to take more time to really think this through, being that it's only been a week and a half since knowing, which is definitly not enough time to be able to clearly process your thoughts in my opinion.

To give a little background on the bf, he isn't out to his family at all, so I wonder if a lot of his paranoia is his fear of coming out to his parents if he were to come out, along with the possibility of also having to tell them about my HIV status. I don't see a reason at all for why he would have to tell his parents about this at all, being that I think it would cause a lot of unnecessary stress that he dosen't need at all. Along with that, all the stress from this got him sick all of last week, which also dosen't help in terms of being able to make a clear decision I feel like. If he were able to tell me with a straight face that he dosen't want anything to do with me anymore, then I wouldn't question it. But the fact that he was saying it while being extremely emotional and crying, I want to think that he was saying it more out of being scared than anything. He also kept talking about how it's not me, it's him, it's not me, it's him. HOW IS IT NOT ME IF IT DOSEN'T WORK OUT THEN??!!

So at the end, I'm able to convince him about the possibility of going to see a counselor together to talk about his fears, and what we could possibly do to save this relationship, if there is still a chance of it being saved. Along with that, I'm telling him to take as much time as he needs in order to clear his head, along with possibly going on a couple more fun dates to see if he feels any differently.

I apologize for the super long post and for the many grammar errors that are probably present, but I really do want to fight for my life to try and make this relationship work. I would feel like the happiest person alive if he were to give me a chance and have our relationship be as close to what it was like beforehand as possible. If it dosen't work however though, I know I'm going to feel very lost, feeling rejected because of my status and wondering where I could go from here.

I am actually a tiny bit worried. I've only had two sexual encounters in my life. The first one happened about a year and a half ago in which my anonymous partner (him and I being both males) and all that occurred was oral sex, ejaculation occurred outside of our mouths, can't say the same about the bits of pre-ejaculation. 

The second encounter happened sometime near the second week of September in which I had a hook with another person but only oral sex occurred as well along with the casual making out. He did not ejaculate in my mouth, neither did I let him have the pleasure of having me do the same to him. Though there might have been pre-ejaculation...but I remember running through the structure of my mouth for any cuts or abnormalities before the encounter...none being there.

Though about a week and a half after the encounter, I had a really bad stomach flu. I understand that the early symptoms include a fever and other things like sore throats, swollen glands, etc. But my symptoms were just a stomach ache, a fever, and diarrhea, nothing else. This lasted for about five days.

At the time I assumed it was just something I ate  prior to the day I started feeling sick (probably the hot dog from that street meat vendor, or the bacon wrap I had, in which I may have to point out I don't eat bacon frequently...and now I started thinking about that HIV could be a possibility?

As of now though, I feel completely fine. I am not feeling many of the symptoms that occur about months after exposure I would assume. I've had muscle pains in my back but that's probably because I luggage around 3 textbooks in my backpack around campus. I haven't been tired without reason through out the day. The only time when I've caught myself sleepy eyed (or tired) during the day include sitting in lectures trying to pay attention with little than 5 hours of sleep because of the previous night's completion of assignments and readings. 

Other than that, my usual anxiety problems have existed even before I had any sexual encounters, so that's probably not any of the symptoms. 

I've heard that catching HIV through oral sex is really rare...but I am not sure how to feel. I'm not worried about that encounter I had year back, more about the recent one. Should I get tested? Should I even feel worried when I feel fine? This is probably me just worrying way too much, but better safe then sorry. 

What do you guys think?"

Its clear, HIV cases are rising all over the planet. If you believe what you read. 

##Let's Assume HIV cases are in fact on the rise

When a person is diagnosed with an illness that they don't understand, that has volumes of information ranging from testing regimens to various drug treatments, they are likely going to be doing a bit of research on the topic. In today's world, this translates to Google searches. Most people who have HIV, have googled something about HIV at some point.  In addition, the friends and family close to one diagnosed positive are additionally probably going to google something related to the topic at some point.

This means, if HIV cases truly are on the rise... we should see a rise in searches pertaining to the disease. If Greece has a growing HIV problem, then we're likely going to see a rise in searches on the topic originating in Greece.

Something that is growing in influence over people, should be reflected in search data.

##Some Examples
Its well known the prescription Adderall is being over prescribed to a degree that many psychiatrists are calling it an epidemic. If this truely is the case, then the google searches for Adderall should be on the rise as well... 

[When we look at the data - this is exactly what we see. As much as a 3-fold increase in the volume of searches on the topic in the last decade.](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=%2Fm%2F02_ggb)

[Image](http://i.imgur.com/rb6KKmm.png)

Its clear the studies showing an epidemic of over-prescription of this drug are backed up by the searches done pertaining to it.

On the other hand, right after 9/11 the topic of Terrorism was very popular. 9/11, we suspect, was ""peak terrorism"". Since then, interest in the topic has waned just from our everyday observations. 

[When we look at the data - this is exactly what we see. Roughly a 6-fold decrease in searches on the topic.](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=Terrorism)

As a final example, we know that Polio has recently been eradicated from India.  Less people with polio in India should equate to fewer searches about polio originating in India.

[When we look at the data - this is exactly what we see. Roughly a 5-fold decrease in searches on the topic over the last decade. This is what the graph of an eradicated epidemic looks like.](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=Polio&amp;geo=IN&amp;cmpt=q) 

[Image](http://i.imgur.com/ilYczHv.png)

##So What About HIV?
HIV is on the rise the news would have us believe... so the searches about the topic should also be on the rise.

[When we look at the data worldwide, however, we see roughly a 2-fold decrease in searches on the topic in the last decade.](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=HIV)

[Image](http://i.imgur.com/i6KL4rM.png)

Worldwide might be a bit too inclusive. Lets investigate searches where we've been told HIV is rising at pandemic rates... where government policies supposedly let HIV run rampant... Lets look at South Africa.

[When we look at the data, we see a 40% decrease in interest on the topic in the last 10 years... a period when the PM of South Africa supposedly caused the deaths of over 300,000 people. More HIV in South Africa, should equate to more searches on the topic. But thats not what we see.](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=HIV&amp;cmpt=q&amp;geo=ZA)

In fact, when you look at most of the African countries where HIV is running rampant, we are seeing a decrease in interest across the board. Granted, internet services are a fairly new addition to the infrastructure of these countries... but trends in interest in those with access are clearly on a downward trend. 


* [Greece on the decline.](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=HIV&amp;cmpt=q&amp;geo=GR)

* [Austin on the decline](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=HIV&amp;geo=US-TX-635&amp;cmpt=q)

* [Australia On The Decline](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=HIV&amp;geo=AU&amp;cmpt=q)

* [Kentucky on the decline](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=HIV&amp;geo=US-KY&amp;cmpt=q)

* [Hong Kong on the decline](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=HIV&amp;geo=HK&amp;cmpt=q)

* [China is the only one that shows an increase in searches on the topic... the only problem is, the increase happened AFTER the story was published that HIV cases were on the rise. At the time the story was published, interest in HIV was decreasing... which is not what what we would expect if there was a rise in infections in the year prior to the story. ](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=HIV&amp;geo=CN&amp;cmpt=q)


Its clear that whats being claimed in studies is not backed up the data - ACROSS THE BOARD. This is the tale tale sign of media/propaganda attempting to influence interest when there is none. 

[In fact, things related to HIV, such as the HIV test are also on the decline. Which is interesting since the new Oraquick product was released in the last decade with a full-on media blitz. Yet the data shows people don't care.](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=HIV%20test&amp;cmpt=q)

[And when HIV Test is graphed next to ""HIV"" we can see that while people are interested in the mythology of HIV... they aren't actually concerned with partaking in it.](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=HIV%20test%2C%20HIV&amp;cmpt=q)

[Perhaps the one search term that has rightfully popped up from nowhere in the last decade.... HIV Conspiracy](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=HIV%20Conspiracy)

###Conclusions
A search on a topic is an expression of interest in the topic. Its clear, that across the board, interest in HIV is waning. Yet the sensationalized media coverage of the the topic is not. The epidemiological studies are coming to conclusions in direct conflict with the empirical evidence.  When there is a disagreement to this degree between what is being reported vs. what is being observed... it begs the question, what could be behind a disagreement of this magnitude.

Even more concerning, is the rapidly increasing in US funding to the HIV industry.... in spite of clear decreased interest across the globe. The US will spend 40 Billion dollars on HIV related projects this year. Nearly twice the budget of NASA. The US will spend roughly 2.5 million dollars per domestic AIDS death this year.  Since the AIDS epidemic started, the US government has spent roughly HALF A TRILLION DOLLARS in HIV related funding.  At a liberal estimate of labor at $200/hr... we have funded 250,000 MAN-YEARS of research into HIV. We have dropped 51 Million dollars per base pair in the HIV genome. 

All a lawmaker knows about the topic is likely the content of the stories mentioned at the top of this article. So getting ever increasing budgets through congress is simple. 

What has happened is a small group of scientists have been given tenure over a deeply engrained, 40 billion dollar taxpayer funded enterprise.... without oversight by the taxpayer. This group uses this money to generate volumes of content... and with the blessing of the government, they are able to push agendas by amplifying their manufactured content through a highly organized and efficient propaganda distribution network.  

Quite simply, the HIV industry is the very definition of a criminal enterprise. A criminal enterprise, where the criminal uses their credentials, their positions,  and a labyrinth of scientific content, propaganda, and clever marketing to convince the layman lawmakers to do their bidding.  They in effect convince the lawmaker, to allow them to steal the taxpayers money with their pseudo-scientific mythology.

Furthermore, they cement themselves at the top of this industry, by creating a whole infrastructure of employment around them.  HIV is a huge job creator. From test manufacturing, clinics, drug research, testing labs, research labs, publications, to patients.... a lot of people depend on the incurable, ever-increasing nature of HIV for their livelihoods.  

Quite simply.... HIV is too big to fail, and too big to cure. HIV is too powerful to cure. 

The words of Ronald Reagan, 27 years ago... are still true today... one can't help but think he knew they would be true for decades to come.

&gt;I wish I could say that the vast amounts of money and effort that we're putting into AIDS research will give us a cure in a week or a year or by an absolutely certain date. The truth is, none of us knows for certain just when a cure will come. It might not be until the late 1990's. It might not be until later. That's why prevention and treatment are so important now. But in the spirit of hope, let's not forget, a cure might possibly arrive much sooner.... I don't know if the day will come when such progress will be in the cards for AIDS research, but that's my hope.

She has been very secretive about the whole thing and only admitted her disease 2 years ago. I've never been super close with her because she is 20 years older and lived pretty far away from me for most of my life.

Now that she finally told us, she brushes off any questions, but a recent visit to her in the hospital gave me some clues. Her cell count was below 200, she has pneumonia (I'm assuming pneumocystis pneumonia) and her memory is very impaired right now. She didn't remember that we visited her, 5 hours after we'd left and it took her 40 minutes to order lunch. Her main concern while we were visiting was why her phone wasn't working, and she couldn't remember if she'd paid the bill. She didn't even remember when she came to the hospital.

I'll tell it straight: she doesn't take care of herself. I'm positive she doesn't take her meds like she should. II'm just worried and I need some answers or some comfort. My whole family could use it. 

Is it possible that she has AIDS acquired dementia? If so, does it ever get better? It is so hard to find information online in an ELI5 format, haha.... 

Also, while there the nurse made it sound like she would be OK just by taking the antiretrovirals and drinking Ensure. Is that a fact or some common bs they spew to make everyone feel better? Sorry for any typos. I am on my phone. Also, sorry if this sub isn't the place for my questions.


Edit: I've gotten some great responses, so far. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Truly.



**Edit 2: I just asked my niece(her daughter) if she is still in the hospital. On Wednesday they said she would be going home in a couple of days. Well, now I'm really freaking out because she said my sis is doing really bad and is hallucinating. Her cell count is 2.0. Still fighting the pneumonia.**

**Edit 3**June 27 : Sis is going in to a hospice facility tomorrow. She was eventually diagnosed with AIDS(I guess she'd just had HIV the whole time, and now it was finally diagnosed as AIDS), AIDS dementia, something called Cryptosporidiosis, pneumonia and something else. It doesn't matter now. It's all starting to blur together. It has been a hellish 4 weeks. I really hope that members of your community keep reaching out and encouraging HIV+ people to take care of themselves. This has all happened relatively quick and we were not prepared for it. 

Oh and her doctor said the dementia seemed to get so much worse because of a thing she called ""unmasking dementia"". We knew she's been forgetful, but I guess you can be doing just fine when you are in your own environment, but when you get taken out of it, your brain can't cope."

I was just curious and I was out last night and decided ""fuck it I want to try it.""

Aprox. 6 months ago I filled some empty vitamin bottles with these tablets (separated buy type / colour) as I was traveling over seas. I left the silicon gel sachet in the bottles. Will these med's still be okay to take? Does anyone have any links to HIV med's shelf life or related please?  
*
p.s Here is the email I received from my HIV nurse:
'its the truvada (blue one) that can be problematic, but if the silicone is still in the bottle they should be OK. it would be good practice to write the use by date on the bottle next time. they are usually 12 months at least when we get them in.'

A whole bunch of conversations branched off on the Reddit BIG BROTHER board about HIV and how apparently people are 100% sure CBS do not consider any applicants who are HIV positive since it is a huge liability and would be a risk to other House Guests. Upon further research Reality TV casting does not fall under any anti-discrimination legislation. It's considered free speech and protected under the first amendment, so it's not illegal for them to exclude HIV positive contestants. What do you all think about this? I know on the Real World we had Pedro, and on RuPaul's Drag Race we have had multiple characters share their status and story, but do you think this is ok for CBS to do in the casting process for this one particular show? Are they adding to the stigma that society associates with the disease? Do you think with this breaking news maybe they will reconsider their options and provide a platform and a voice to the HIV community to explain and educate the masses by casting a Positive individual on the show?

He has yet to get started on combined antiretroviral therapy at this time but one of his biggest concerns for the future is not being able to get his medications reliably.  My questions are

1.  How long is your supply for HIV medications? For example are you limited to a 30 day supply or is a 90 day supply or longer possible?
2.  How do you get your medication?  Mail-ordered, pharmacy pick up?
3.  Does the delivery/pick-up method have any say on how long the supply is?
4.  Do specific medications only have a certain quantity given at a time? For example for people on atripla do you always get 30 day supply at a time or is it variable?  Or for others like complera are there limitations on supply etc?
5.  For people who have to travel for extensive amount of time for work what is your experience with obtaining your medications while away?
6.  How much does your particular type of insurance or medication assistance program have to do with your supply?

Thank you so much!  I really do appreciate the help.  Haven't found much on the internet about this?"

More specifically, I find that after I've had about three drinks, if I take a shot afterwards I 90% of the time find myself rushing to the bathroom to vomit.  It's rarely because I actually drank too much.  
  
For context, I am a 22 year old male, and never had an issue holding my liquor before.  I wouldn't consider myself a frequent heavy drinker, but I would consider myself 22.  
  
Only recently did it occur to me that this may have something to do with either HIV or Stribild.  I asked my doctor about this, and she said that it *may* be some of the Stribild-induced nausea, but that it isn't something she often hears.  
  
My question is, does anyone else with HIV or on Stribild experience this as well?  I don't find myself really experiencing any other side effects, but this one is a bit... annoying.  Obviously, if this is my only side effect, I can deal with it and my situation could be WAY worse.  Just wondering if this is an experience shared by others, and if there's anything I could do (besides not drinking, of course) to reduce this.
  
In other news, I recently became undetectable and my CD4s are in the 900s!  
  
**EDIT:**  For anyone newly diagnosed who is coming to this sub with questions about medications... don't let this post freak you out.  Stribild has otherwise done wonders for me, and as mentioned earlier I've never had any other side effects besides some vomiting my first month of taking it."

Before 2 weeks exactly, I had sex with an escort, I don't know anything about her at all. Anyway, we used a condom, but then when I finished, I found the condom was broken and I cum inside her. 

I freaked out, I cleaned myself, and asked her if she's negative, she assured me she is. But can't believe her.

Went after 30 hours to a doctor, unfortunately, where I live the rate of HIV is very low, so he gave me two medicines (lamivier and efiver) for HIV treatment. I take 3 pills a day.

But I read that they might be bad for the heart, or might cause liver problem or something else. Since 2 weeks I take them. I don't know, should I stop?

I'm going to meet him in the next 48 hours, but I wanted to hear your opinion. 

BTW, I'm sweating at night. It's not excessive. But it's winter here, but my t-shirt is ""cold"" and I freaked out today when I knew that. Couldn't go back to sleep.

Please advise. What do I have to do? do I stop taking the treatment? I don't want to have a new problem of something that might not be a problem in the first place. 

And to all of you out there who have HIV, I wish you the best of life. Now I know the importance of body. I didn't care before, but now I feel the pain. So it has been a good experience for me. So I wish you speedy recovery and a life full of health. 

Will make a donation too to HIV organization online. What happened to me changed me completely. I do care for other's now and I want to help.

I'd like to get feedback on the game from people on this forum. 

Development first started at the Games for Health game jam, which was sponsored by the CDC. The theme was HIV awareness and prevention. A game jam is an event where people get together to make a game in a short period of time. 

Our game was one of the 5 winners selected and we've been working on improving the game since. The CDC will choose one of those games to do a study on, in mid December. 

The title of the game is, ""I'm Positive"". 

The game is a branching text based narrative, interspersed with a series of mini-games. You play as a young man that finds out he may have HIV from a former partner. The player then makes a series of choices to get treated. The game length is about 7 to 15 minutes. 

Our aim with the game is to encourage testing and increase knowledge on HIV, with the hopes of reducing some stigma.

Neither I nor my group members have HIV, but I hope we treated the subject matter with the sensitivity it deserves. 

The game is free and is available for desktop operating systems (OSX, Windows, Linux), as well as a
download for Android devices. In the future, the game will be available for iOS devices in the App Store and in Google Play for Android devices. 

The game isn't computer intensive, so you shouldn't have any problem running it. If you do, please let me know. 

Here's a link to the site for downloading the game, a trailer, and screenshots.

www.impositivegame.com

Let me know your thoughts, what you liked, disliked, and any advice or criticism you may have. Feel free to PM me, if you prefer. 

Thank you very much!

So basically, I'm Australian, and I met my girlfriend / SO, a Thai citizen, when I spent a year studying in Thailand in 2012. She's awesome, love her heaps, it's always been an easy &amp; happy relationship. Anyhow, in July 2014 she was diagnosed with hiv, and after testing we discovered that I don't have it. Of course, my first priority was supporting her through all the things that people go through after being diagnosed with hiv. She's probably one of the strongest people I know, but the emotional fallout from being diagnosed with hiv will knock anyone over.. and I've been doing my best to support her. But now the dust has settled a little, and due to external factors, I really need to figure out what what this means for me.

So, in no particular order, these are the implications; is there a question around infidelity, her migrating to Australia will be difficult, and what about kids.


I should preface the following questions (and thoughts) by saying I've not been able to bounce this off anyone. My partner, quite understandably, didn't feel comfortable talking to friends or family about this sitation. That's fine, but it just means I have absolutely no point of reference. Some of the following seems so absurd to be asking, but because I'm involved in this, I honestly don't know whether they are fair questions, or just the product of emotion and anxiety.


*Re: infidelity*

I've been trying not to think about this, but if I'm really honest with myself there has been a 'nagging doubt' since her diagnosis. Given the timeframe of her diagnosis, after we had been together for approx 2.5 years, does this suggest infidelity? I'm sure that to anyone reading this, this sounds like a dumb question coming from some insecure posessive type, but again, I honestly don't know if this is a fair question. It would be horrible to find myself, years from now, discovering that it's almost a certainty that my partner contracted hiv from a sexual partner during our relationship. I guess I'm expecting to be told that it's not possible to accurately discerne whether someone has contracted hiv more or less than three years ago based only on their CD4 count. I'm ok with that, I just need to know that her CD4 count isn't a strong indicator of infidelity.


I don't think this is really relevant, because I know that here in /r/hiv you all know that having hiv doesn't mean that someone is some kind of slut, but I'm feeling a bit exposed telling you all that my partner has hiv, so I'll also tell you that she's a good woman, not some kind of 'bar woman', and had only a few sexual partners before me.


*Re: kids*

I've not really looked into this, but she has. Basically it seems like we would be able to have children via some form of IVF, and there would be a negligible risk of the child contracting hiv. So that's cool.


*Re: residing in Australia*

This one is tricky. However, I've looked into this in detail, and I'm in the process of getting professional advice. To put it briefly, her most recent holiday visa application was declined because she's spent too much time here apparently, which basically means we have to apply for either a defacto or fiance visa. Again summarising, we will fail the defacto application because we don't have any shared finances or anything. So that leaves us with the fiance visa. Basically we need to get married so she can come to Australia.

I'd been thinking of asking her to marry me back in June before we found out about the hiv, and again when we applied for the holiday visa a few weeks ago, I was thinking seriously about whether or not to ask her to marry me in the next few months. But it just sucks so much to think that immigration is basically telling me I have to propose before they will let her come to Australia again. 

So I think that's it.. thanks for listening. I'm not really asking for any specific sort of advice here, just needed to tell someone what's going on while I try to figure it out. Having said that, any insight anyone can offer would be nice.

Looking for perspective of people with HIV, questions are bolded. Answers and information greatly appreciated. :)

Hi, I'm a college student currently working on a mobile game that tries to educate about the dangers of HIV via a side-scrolling shooter. The game itself is an imperfect metaphor for the mechanism of action of HIV, and the UI surrounding it helps emphasize the danger of HIV and how to prevent yourself from getting it.

I am, however, having some trouble getting actual demographic research done. As in, actually being able to interview people about HIV and their experience with it. This is important to me and the development of this game, so I'd love it if you guys could share your experiences with me!

Really, the big question I'm trying to answer is this: **What would you have needed to hear to avoid being infected by HIV? Would you have needed more education (eg. how is HIV transmissed, etc)? Would you have needed a deeper impression of the importance of protection during sex? Or a more urgent sense of the importance of you and your partner getting tested before unprotected sex?**

My experience is that I was dating a man that discovered he was HIV positive midway through our relationship. I was very fortunate that I had not been infected (I had an IUD and stupidly did not make him get tested)! So even though we are no longer together, this is a game I want to reach the public, and I want it to be as effective in educating about the dangers of HIV as I can make it before then. 

I saw an article about the stigma of getting tested for HIV. I originally supposed the article was about the stigma against having HIV, which I would assume is a thing. So additional questions I have are:

**Have you faced discrimination because you're HIV positive? (I can think of at least one person that would end a relationship based on that, I'm sure there are more) What would be the most effective ways to help combat that discrimination? (I'm thinking of starting with effectiveness of preventing transmission via condoms and PreP)**

Finally, while I'm still a little ways from doing wide-spread playtesting (I need to make playtesting forms and reports, haha!), I've been trying to reach out to various HIV/AIDS support groups so I can bring my game there and watch people play it and get their feedback and reactions to it. Uh...unfortunately, there are a lot of confidentiality issues with that. **So I was wondering if anyone knew of some support groups in the Seattle area that I could maybe see if they were open to the idea of playtesting my game.** I'd appreciate some pointers in the right direction, anyhow. There doesn't seem to be a lot of them around.

Thanks a bunch for taking the time to read this huge thing, especially if you take the time out of your day to answer! I'd be happy to put a build up on the internet for Reddit to absolutely tear apart in a month or so (^^;), but I'm not sure what the best way to do that would be. It's a Unity project, so I could push a web player build, but I don't know if/how I could distribute the Android build. And I can't currently push to iPhone, sorry Apple users. :) So you'll have to give me some time to figure that out.

Thanks again everyone!"

The next day after i was a bit better. I took Oraquick at home and was tested negative, but i don't know the accuracy of it. I went to the doctor after that and she ordered me some tests since im still worried. Now the only problem is that my lymph nodes feel a bit weird. They arent swollen at all, they just feel worked, the throat lymph nodes, under the chin. Throughout the course of it, it felt as if I had a loss of appetite.

I'm so scared right now. What do i do? Am i just overreacting now? Is it just the flu? What happens if I have it? Can I have a normal life? How can I get a girlfriend if I have HIV? "

I'm starting to brainstorm about an HIV advocacy project/event that I can host on my college's campus this Spring.

My school is traditionally very conservative so there may be that hurdle.

Anyway, about six months ago I found out that I am positive. I know that there are other guys in my town infected that don't know it yet, and I would really love to host some sort of testing/awareness drive. Does anyone thing this is a feasible idea? I know it would take a lot of planning and execution to achieve enough privacy and such, but it seems worth it to me.

Any ideas/thoughts/comments welcome..."

AFAIK I've never been with someone who was HIV+ so its really new to me.

I'm not really worried about my risk of exposure right now since we haven't had penetrative sex. I do feel he should have told me before we had any sexual contact, but that's neither here nor there. I'm more worried about him. I have an ex who I was still friends with who died of diabetes-related issues at the age of 35, and another who attempted suicide while we were together less than a year ago. I really don't want to go through something so scary again when I'm not even 30.

I guess the most important thing I should ask is what should I do to support him? We haven't been together very long but I don't want to end the relationship over it. He told me he hasn't taken his medicine in a while since it's so expensive, makes him feel like crap, and has some serious side effects. Are the drugs really that awful? If its something that could save his life, wouldn't it be worth it?! He also confessed to not going to regular check ups for some time because they take so much blood. If they can test for HIV infection from just a drop, why would they need so much from an HIV+ patient? I just think he isn't doing a good job taking care of himself and that scares me.

I'm also wondering about depression related to HIV. He seems to sometimes think he's a dead man walking. He never wears his seatbelt despite me nagging him. He doesn't take care of himself as I already said. He eats super unhealthy. He said every time he gets sick he wonders if it will kill him because of his disease, though he didn't say it has progressed to AIDS. 

Should I insist on him getting blood work to check his viral loaf and that he gets back on his meds before I engage in penetrative sex? I know condoms are very effective, but they aren't perfect. This whole thing is very new to me and I don't really know who to talk to or where to find good, accurate information, so any help would be appreciated.

Tl;Dr my SO is positive, and I know very little about the virus. Pls help."

I'm an Australian citizen, and my HIV positive partner is looking to migrate to Australia. I've looked into the situation in detail, and have a fairly good handle on the migration process and the likelihood of our visa application being successful.

One part of this process runs thusly:

 * my partner's offshore doctor does a health assessment which is sent do the department of immigration and citizenship (DIAC) as part of the application.
 * the DIAC asks the Medical Officer of the Commonwealth (MOCs) to develop an estimate of the healthcare costs of an individual with the same infection and severity as my partner. Usually they come back with a figure of ~$250,000 for someone in my partner's situation.
 * we then engage a medical professional to consider the MOC's estimate, and revise it down to a more appropriate figure. I've seen many other cases where such an appropriate figure is more like $70k or $80k.

My problem for the moment, is finding such a health care professional.

I've contacted a few non-profit organisations in Australia which assist people with HIV, but strangely they seem unable to direct me to someone who is appropriately qualified and would be willing to issue such an estimate for an appropriate fee. I should say that these organisations have tried their best to be helpful in their own way, buy giving me a boatload of information about the health care needs of people living with HIV and the costs of that health care. But it wouldn't seem appropriate for me, a layperson, to issue a cost estimate revising an estimate developed by a qualified health care professional.

I'm pretty stuck with this, so I'd love to hear from you if you have any thoughts at all.

I have several piercings myself from years ago, and this was the first time I had been in a piercing studio since I found out my status.

The question popped in my head so I asked, ""Does your protocol change when a client is HIV positive?""

""Absolutely. I don't pierce people with HIV.""

Ohh ok, that's alright I thought...maybe it's a piercers choice.

""So does anyone pierce HIV positive people?""

""Not anywhere around here...I don't think anyone really does, because they don't want to have to deal with the health department."" ""If I pierce you, I'd be putting myself at risk and all my other clients."" ""I mean your immune system is really compromised, so you could technically die from an infected piercing.""

At this point I'm scratching my head...how fucking ignorant can one person be??

""I'm HIV positive."" I tell her, as my friend is sitting in her chair about to get pierced.

I figure that biting my tongue instead of starting an argument was the best route. It was clear this lady thought she was super educated with her facts...unfortunately all of them were wrong.

I was in utter disbelief.

**Does anyone have any knowledge on the subject they'd like to share?**

The doctor believes it is either lymphoma or HIV. 

My friend has had a lot of sexual partners and rarely uses condoms, so she's definitely at a higher risk. 

Anyway, while we wait for the biopsy/blood test results, all she can think about is how this is going to ruin the rest of her life. Some of the things she's been saying:

- I'm not going to be able to have sex until I'm in a committed, long-term relationship and they'd have to be willing to have sex with someone that's HIV positive
- No one is going to want to date someone with HIV
- I'm going to have to take a pill every day for the rest of my life
- I'm only going to live for 50 more years
- I'm never going to get married 
- I'm going to have to use a condom every time I have sex, even with a committed partner

As an outsider, I believe that she will find someone that she can have sex with that truly loves her. I know that if the guy I'm deeply in love with told me he has HIV I would still be in a relationship with him, and I know there are plenty of people that are the same way. 

I've said this to her several times but she still doesn't believe it. I know that it's still a new issue to be dealing with and it will obviously take a lot of time to come to terms with it, but what can I do to help her right now? For those who are HIV positive, what would you have wanted to hear from your loved ones when you were in her position? "

It was only about two minutes and he did not ejaculate. Still, after six weeks I got the 20-minute antibody test and tested negative.

That was Monday of last week, and on the following Wednesday and Thursday I had day-long headaches that culminated in muscle aches and a fever of 103 on Friday evening. Saturday I felt better.

I've read about the ""HIV flu"" that comes on 1-2 months after infection. My question is: if I tested negative for the antibodies on Monday, is it possible that they were undetectable on Monday but came on fast enough to cause the flu-like symptoms I had starting on Wednesday?

There are other potential causes for my flu (exhaustion, new medication, the gym) but I want to know if this is reason enough to get the antibody test again, or just wait until the 3-month mark.

Thank you."

If yes, this article my help you. I’ll show you how to know your HIV status and overall health at home. You just need to have general blood test results. It’s mostly likely that you have some recent blood test results at home. If you don’t have, you can visit your nearest clinic and get some.

General blood test results show your blood cell counts and the condition of your blood chemistry. There are three blood cells in a human body: Red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC) and platelets. The normal RBC count ranges from 4,000,000-6,200,000/ml while WBC ranges from 4,300-10,800/mm3. The platelet count for a health person ranges from 130,000-440,000/mm3. If the counts of your blood cells are below or above these values, you are not in good health. You may be suffering from a serious infection like HIV or TB.

Moreover, these cells have other components that can tell you more about your health. For example, RBCs have components, such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. On the other hand, WBCs have lymphocytes, granulocytes and monocytes. These components are further divided into subcomponents. All these components and subcomponents have their normal levels. Want to study your blood further and know your HIV status and overall health? Visit [How to Know your HIV Status and Overall Health at Home Using Blood Test Results.](http://jansaints.hubpages.com/hub/How-to-Know-your-HIV-Status-and-Overall-Health-at-Home) to learn more about the cells and their components and subcomponents. Blood chemistry also tells a lot about your health. Get to learn everything you need to know about your blood chemicals.

The wholesale price of Stribild in Canada is approximately $16,600 per person per year; this is considerably less than the wholesale price in the U.S., which is about $28,500 per person per year.

Triumeq is about the same at an average $28,000

If you have a co-infection of Hep C which as many of us know is quite common:

Solvadi sells for $1,000 a pill in the U.S. That price means a three-month regimen for hepatitis C costs $84,000.  $168,000 for 24 weeks.

In this current system there will always have to be a strong measure of profit and this allows for more research and innovative study/development but I think these kind of margins are just insane.

Maybe to get people on ART and or governments providing free medication is simply allowing the price to be reduced.  Maybe they can find a sweet spot where with price reduction more is ordered and they can make money back on the supply side.

I'm no expert but I feel there has to be a lot better than this..."

I cannot lie I lived fast and didn't take proper precautions I have never done any IV drugs but a few women I was with were doing them for sure. How it was contracted I'm not sure when or from whom but I guess at this point that doesn't matter.
I am going thru it right now . I am very alone and very closed off. Since I've found out I am soo nervous around people and I was once a very outgoing guy. I am becoming so socially awkward which I feel will pass once I come to full terms with everything and become comfortable in my own skin again. A main concern I have is the fact that HIV is profoundly in the gay community and being a straight male I feel so alone. The rate of women with hiv has to be significantly lower and finding a. Hiv+ female partner might prove a daunting task..even more daunting is convincing a hiv- person that love can still be had. This disease has changed how I see my life and honestly it has helped put things into perspective and my general outlook has become better. I am a better man for it but alas I'm alone. I'm depressed and working to the bone ignoring the fact that my immune system is killing itself (I am not on meds yet) I was diagnosed 6 months ago. Probably been positive for a year or more. Flawed healthcare system has delayed the process (I have no insurance) I need advice. Where do I go. What do I do. I'm lost, I'm scared and I am alone. I left my parents place at 15 I have had my own place for multiple years now. My family is estranged. I got evicted from my last apt. and when the only ppl I told about my concerns(roommates) they took me to get tested and kicked me out because they couldn't ""risk it"". I was broke and homless I lived in a tent from Feb. To April. I worked all day everyday at my job and bought myself a new vehicle. 2 days later I got an OVI and had to relocate due to the cops(license suspended) and I lived in my car (sorry have to drive) now I have a new job and am crashing with a dude I met at a bar who was kind enough to allow me to stay (in exchange for cash) but he is still kind of a stranger. I have relocated and am so sheltered . Friends are non existent trust me it's a lonely life I lead and things are piling up on me to where I'm here at 5 in the morning posting my life story on reddit looking for any suggestions to help a young man not collapse under the weight of himself"

Since then, I have had medical assistance, and been able to go to the doctor regularly. This has saved my life, over and over again. How can that be?

Well, I have chronic asthma, allergies, diabetes, epilepsy and ichthyosis. That's a pretty long list of chronic diseases, all of which were not enough to qualify me for medical assistance. Left untreated, these conditions made it impossible to keep a job for the 90 days required to get coverage, or lead to being fired for taking too much time off for doctor's appointments. I was on a two-decade spiral leading directly to death by way of high sugars, asthma attacks and seizures.

Then I was diagnosed.

Then the insurance came.

Now, I'm better than I have ever been, but I'm by no means ""well"". Managing these conditions is possible, but it takes most of my time.

But at least I can try now. At least I have the resources to live. Without a positive HIV diagnosis, I would be dead of a heart attack, or strangled to death by my own lungs, or wrapped around a phone pole while seizing in a car while driving.

That's as close to a ""positive attitude"" I can have. Thank you for listening."

Edit:  I'm not a doctor, and I never presume to ""know better"" than qualified health care providers.  I work in the community and with a caseload of HIV positive people to keep them engaged in care while making sure that they are as healthy, happy, and well-adjusted as possible.  It's also a huge part of my job to show patients that you can lead a healthy life with HIV - I've been positive for 10 years and I'm doing great.  I'd really love to field more questions related specifically to my experience as an HIV Peer Educator and less of a discussion on the efficacy of treatment, as that isn't my speciality."

First off let me say that I am not a scientist or a researcher, but I have committed my computing resources to these projects to aid those researchers and scientists because I am HIV+. You can do this as well and it is very simple to do; all you need is your home computer. In one project I understand that they are utilizing a PlayStation 3, but I am still looking into this one. The research is happening on multiple computer platforms including Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and VirtualBox.


This has apparently been going on for a few years now, but I just learned about this a few days ago. It starts with Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing: AKA: BONIC. A program that was originally designed for SETI program founded by Carl Sagan and Frank Drake. This program is now used by researchers from a variety of fields to (and I quote from the University of Berkeley website) “use the idle time of your computer (Windows, Mac, Linux, or Android) to cure diseases [such as HIV], study global warming, discover pulsars, and many other types of scientific research. It’s safe, secure, and easy.” It caught my attention and quick!


This is where you can obtain the BOINC software and learn more about it: http://boinc.berkeley.edu/index.php


You will also receive credit or at least mentioned; even if it is anonymously, for allowing them to utilize the resources of your computer to conduct their research. Most of these studies appear to be working on full-atom molecular simulations of the HIV proteins namely the protease and reverse transcriptase.


The notable projects using BOINC software to conduct their research on HIV proteins include:


Rosetta@home being conducted by University of Washington Baker Laboratory

Their website is: http://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/

Rosetta is currently conducting at least three studies on my computer at this present time and here is a graphic of one of those studies. [Rosetta Research Graphic](http://i.imgur.com/iqFAm0G.jpg)



GPUGrid.net being conducted by University Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, Spain

This one I am still looking into. The project shows as “active” and is the one that is utilizing a PlayStation 3. I have added it to my list in the BOINC program, but nothing is running as of yet. I just don’t have many details on this project.

Their website is: https://www.gpugrid.net/

FightAIDS@Home – World Community Grid being conducted by IBM Corporate Citizenship.
This one I have not yet added to my BOINC project list, but I am working on it.

Their website is: http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/research/faah/overview.do

There are about 70 different projects going on out there that utilize the BOINC program and they cover a wide variety of scientific studies, but these were the ones that I noted conducting HIV protein research. So join in the research by committing your idle computing time to one or more of these projects to stop HIV in its tracks. The more people that commit to this the greater and stronger the computing grid is. So spread the word!


If you have any questions regarding the BOINC software, the projects, etc. post to this thread or send me a private message and I will be happy to share any knowledge that I have.

We are long-term survivors of the AIDS pandemic, the most devastating health crisis of the modern era. We are all affected by, and many of us are infected with, HIV.

We come from diverse races and ethnic backgrounds, genders, incomes, ages, and physical abilities. We are all impacted differently by decades of living with HIV and surviving the AIDS pandemic. 

Since the first instances of ""gay cancer"" posted in our community in 1981, we rallied together against an indifferent world to care of each other and collectively fight back against HIV. With courage and compassion, we strive not only to survive HIV but also to thrive into full, meaningful, and productive lives. In the face of significant adversity, individually and collectively, we learned that we are resilient. 

There are a few definitions of Long-Term Survivor (LTS)

• Pre-HAART LTS—Longest-term survivors are individuals who acquired HIV in the 1980s and 1990s, before the advent of highly effective antiretroviral therapy (pre-HAART) when having HIV was considered a death sentence. Those living longest with HIV have physical and psychosocial implications that are vastly different from those who acquired HIV later in the epidemic.

• Post-HAART LTS—those who tested past 1996 and living with HIV for over 10 years. 

• There are long-term survivors of a different stripe that are often left out of the discourse. They are the survivors who remain HIV-negative. They were lovers, caretakers and frontline healthcare workers. They were lesbians who stepped in to take care of people with HIV and AIDS. They too suffered enormous losses. 

It has been over thirty years since the Denver Principles began the self-empowerment movement for people living with HIV but long-term survivors now find our voices muted. Our issues are sidelined by the agencies we helped to form. Conferences devoted to HIV are focused on newer topics while relegating long-term survivors to the sidelines and affinity sessions off the main stage.

Our marginalization exacts a toll our mental health, which in turn affects our overall physical health and quality of life. The White House updated the National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the U.S. in July 2015 with no mention of the experiences or the lived reality of long-term survivors. 

Now is the time to reclaim our silenced voices and insure that long-term survivors’ perspectives are not ignored. With talk about the End of AIDS and campaigns like Getting To Zero, it becomes vital that we take care of and acknowledge long-term survivors.
 
We are into the fourth decade of the HIV epidemic and half the people living with HIV are age 50 and older. By 2020 that number will be 70%. This is a wakeup call to focus on the needs and reality of older individuals aging with HIV. Because we had the audacity to survive we now face a host of challenges few of us could have predicted. 

The Challenges 
Long-term survivors face a myriad of interconnected psychosocial, practical, and medical challenges rooted in HIV-stigma, aging, ageism, and economic distress that impacts functional health-related quality of life (HRQoL) issues. 

Psychosocial 
The AIDS epidemic has been a series of traumatic events. We now know that surviving can also have trauma-related implications. The legacy of our past is having an effect on our lives now, and too many survivors are unaware of what is happening to them.
 
The effects of sustained trauma now present in combinations of depression, anxiety, emotional numbness, anger, survivor guilt, insomnia, nightmares, hypervigilance, hopelessness, substance abuse, sexual risk-taking, emotional numbness, low-self esteem, avoidance, social withdrawal and isolation, and/or a lack of future orientation.

We call this AIDS Survivor Syndrome (ASS). It exists on a spectrum and varies by degrees of intensity and it affects long-term survivors differently at different times.

It is a natural response to posttraumatic stress (PTS). It often occurs years after the trauma ended. We stand with the movement to Drop the D in PTSD because a perfectly human response is not a ""disorder"".
 
Healthcare practitioners do not look for ASS among older clients thereby missing the bigger picture and impacting the quality of care survivors receive. They treat individual symptoms without seeing the larger dynamic at play.  

We need to let our tribe know the problematic feelings people are experiencing are authentic and legitimate and that they are shared by many among us. We need to inform the people charged with our healthcare that underneath our depression may lay a forest of co-occurring psychological symptoms that are easily misunderstood. There is an urgent need for cultural competence training for everyone working with older individuals with HIV including trauma-informed care with an awareness of the experiences of the early days of the HIV epidemic. 

Often hidden behind an angry mask is a person terrified by the idea 
of growing old after decades not imagining it would happen.

There are a substantial number of women long-term survivors who are often left out of the current HIV discourse. Trauma-related issues specific to women include intimate partner violence. Especially vulnerable are transwomen and women of color. Medications are most often studied on men; few have been conducted on dosing women.

As survivors age, we tend to isolate. Those living longest with HIV pull away just when we need to lean in and lean on our community. If we still have any semblance of a community left after so many extraordinary losses, we must make every effort to build new social networks that were once the hallmark of our response to HIV.
 
Living in isolation makes finding a sense of meaning and purpose difficult. It can breed a despair that can be devastating and may lead to suicide. Isolation increases the tendency toward depression. Survivors also feel a sense of guilt that they lived when so many of their loved ones and community died. 


HIV stigma remains an onerous, hideous problem. Stigma resulting from fear of contagion has morphed into laws criminalizing sex with HIV-positive individuals. Combating stigma requires employing active, multipronged strategies, not just simple slogans. 

To battle it we need to reject stigma and strengthen empowered networks of long-term survivors. Being HIV positive is nothing to be ashamed of—it never has been. Though disclosure for some, especially HIV-positive women of color and transwomen can be especially perilous. But when it is safe, we need to stand bravely in the light and not hide our HIV-status. The more visible we are the stronger we combat stigma. 

The face of stigma may be changing now due to the new prevention options, Pre-exposure Prophylaxis
 (PrEP), Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP), Treatment as Prevention (TasP) has joined condoms in the new prevention toolbox that has that added potential for reducing stigma is opening the door to a kind of connectedness possible before HIV made sex fearful. In that environment, the ones being stigmatized may well become the ones who do are not testing and do not know their HIV status. We need to make HIV testing as routine as testing for cholesterol and CBC. 

Long-term survivors are now encountering ageism. We never imagined we'd live long enough to that face that ""ism"", so it is challenging when it occurs. It is too easy to feel invisible and useless in a youth-obsessed culture. But, again, we do not have to participate. Much of ageism has to do with our own perception, given that the majority of people with HIV are older. We must make an effort to acknowledge one another and not treat each other as invisible and yet any older adult has felt the sting of invisibility. 

People who were once courageously at the forefront of activism years ago are now feeling invisible as we age. Since many people with HIV have returned to health, the community has shifted its priorities. The assumption is that we have regained our physical wellbeing and no longer need support, attention, or resources. Those assumptions however are far from our lived reality.

There's an urgent need for affordable, culturally-aware mental health services from professionals who understand our rich, complicated histories as well as the possibility of trauma. We need to insure that the peer-to-peer support services that have long been a staple of HIV stay focused to the changing realities of older individuals with HIV. 

Socioeconomic 
Long-term survivors never imagined living long enough to reach ""retirement age” and many if not most have no money saved. For years retirement was a euphemism for being on disability. Often survivors live below the poverty level crippling their ability to be engaged citizens of the world. For many that only gets worse after they reach 65. If they have been on disability for years (or in some cases for decades) the future looks frightening. Without ""paying into the system"" they only qualify for the minimum Social Security benefits once they reach retirement age. 

Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is antiquated and in need of major reforms. It doesn't allow for saving of more than $2000 in assets. As if it were possible to save on a limited income. Social Security Disability (SSDI) income is not enough to live on. Our options are limited. Living month-to-month and not living well 
are the soul-crushing reality survivors face today. Survivors on disability are treated as suspect and forced to prove ongoing disability to insurers. We are guilty until proven innocent because our disability is often 

invisible. That suspicion creates stress that affects healthy aging.
 
The long gaps in our work histories and lack of skills to work in the modern digital world present a high hurdle to reentering the work place. Combined with ageism, returning to work for the majority of survivors nearly impossible. Even survivors who have remained working are ineligible to purchase long-term care insurance, making their financial future distressingly precarious. 

In urban settings, the lack affordable housing impacts our lives and our ability to stay in treatment. Many people are isolated from biological families and have lost many of their ""logical families"", lovers and friends, and therefore face these challenges alone. 

Long-term care is only available to those of financial means and not those living on disability incomes. It will be up to the community to care for older individuals with HIV.

Medical 
Our ongoing economic distress is correlated with poorer health outcomes and impacts our ability to get to and stay “undetectable” or virally suppressed. Treatment as prevention (TasP) is an important component in the Getting to Zero campaigns, yet getting to undetectable attainable for those without the means and determination. Class, race, gender, access, and poverty remain barriers to the goal of getting to undetectable.
 
Detectable or not, survivors are dealing with accelerating aging from persistent inflammation. We have ramifications from years taking medications that were often ineffective as well as toxic. In those years before highly effective antiretroviral therapy (HAART) combination therapy was available many individuals took mono therapy and built resistance. Today many long-term survivors are on ""salvage therapy"" and are left with limited drug options.

For decades we have lived with stress that would break the hardiest of people. Untreated and often hidden stress can become a killer. Unfortunately, many survivors self-medicate with alcohol and substances that do more harm than good. We need to revisit proven, healthier ways to deal with stress.

Long-term survivors are once again on the medical frontier, facing accentuated aging and increased frailty before our time. Comorbidities factors like Hep C, diabetes, increased cardiovascular disease and strokes these and other HIV related ailments all present a complicated medical situation that continue to have a devastating impact on survivors’ health. It is well known that ongoing gastrointestinal problems occur early in HIV infection and many long-term survivors live with debilitating neuropathy. Contradictory and ever-changing predictions about our life expectancies are enough to make our heads spin. We survived the odds before so must remember that as we age.
 
In the U.S., the majority of people living with HIV are over 50. There is a strong need for understanding of the scientific and medical complexities associated with the biology of HIV and aging. We need more research that requires ongoing and sustained funding as well as stronger leadership on LTS issues. We face a crisis in long-term health care sensitive to long-term survivors.

A VISION FOR OUR FUTURE

Let's Kick ASS was formed to raise awareness about the invisible but very real effects of AIDS survivor syndrome and posttraumatic stress. However, raising awareness is not enough. The reason for our formation was to overcome ASS so that we can make the next decades the best they can be.

Long-term survivors often have a hard time wrapping our brains around the idea of a future. Decades of believing that that our lives would be cut short have trained us not to consider ""what if"", yet here we are facing the conundrums of midlife and aging with HIV. 

Ours is not a movement simply about nostalgia, pain and grief. It is also a
 testament to the resilience of the human spirit, to humans who rolled up their sleeves 
and refused to accept our death sentences.

The result of that resilience is we are living longer. It presents tremendous opportunities and our calls on us to be creative, compassionate and passionate. If you are not yet in touch with that idea that you are resilient, it is ok. You have to notice it for it take root. If we stop focusing on all the times we nearly died and the loved ones we lost but recall instead at how we got back up, how you survived. That begins to change our perspective. We need a more nuanced view of resiliencies and focus on the ways to increase resilience as we age. 

It becomes important for those who survived to tell our stories, to speak our truth with compassion. Our legacy rests in our hands. We must write new, more accurate narratives that reflects the complexity of our history and the richness of our lives ones that honor our past, but does not weigh us down in it. Our histories are more than simply our histories, because the stories we tell ourselves about our survival are an important part of the healing of our lives. Our stories hold the key to richer, fuller lives. Re-writing our stories are vital to our survival.
 
We must engage in intergenerational dialog in a meaningful, respectful conversation that stresses our example of resilience and survival as well as our struggles then and now. The generations we have much to learn from each other. 

We find ourselves underrepresented in the decision-making AIDS institutions, boards of directors, or executive positions, reminiscent of the earliest days of AIDS. Yet we have the knowledge, experience and wisdom to make a meaningful contribution to the discussions and programs affecting our lives. This requires long-term survivors to speak up and demand a seat at the table. Not just an advisory board for show but meaningful inclusion about matters related to our lives.

We must battle against cynicism, judgment and infighting because we are all in this together. We need the most creative ideas for tactics and strategies for healthy aging and what it means to live a good life. We will no longer be ignored as we empower each other and ourselves to find meaning and purpose in the aftermath of the HIV epidemic. We assert our right to return to work, volunteer, and be involved productively in society. 

It is critical that AIDS survivor syndrome (ASS) and the effects of PTS be acknowledged, evaluated, understood, and studied. We know enough to know the phenomenon is real. While we see it among our cohort every day. We are the catalysts to creating change.

In the quest for the End of AIDS, the lives and experiences of those longest affected by the epidemic must be prioritized, not minimized or ignored. It is now time to become fully engaged elders, teachers, and leaders. We've learned valuable lessons about survival and community empowerment that implores us to share it with the world. 

The realities of the older generation are excluded from the decision-making bodies as younger, well-intended, often HIV-negative individuals have taken the helm at HIV service organizations. They are ill-equipped to provide services to the now majority of those living with HIV. We must insist that providers of all stripes, including aging providers, become culturally competent so that our needs and issues are placed front and center.

We must come together to defeat the twin scourges of stigma and ageism. Studies suggest the best approach to reducing stigma is focusing on personal contact, education, and empowerment. It also happens when we refuse to be shamed. We must revisit the idea of empowerment and what it means now. We reduce stigma by building strong connected networks of long-term survivors. We owe that to each other by working together and being strong in the places we hurt most
If our history teaches us anything, it is that when we come together we can make a difference in peoples' lives. With courage and compassion, we strive not only to survive HIV but also to thrive into full, meaningful, productive, independent and connected lives. We want to continue a respectful conversation among peers and educate the world about the existence and power of survivors. The power of a grassroots movement is that it is from the bottom up not the top down. 

This declaration is a call for additional ideas, dialog, solutions and action for long-term survivors and those aging with HIV. Use what you want to of this document to help create dialog and action. We do not have the luxury of time. This is urgent that we improve the lives of survivors. Our work will continue as long as there is one isolated survivor left in that lonely room.

I have started dating, and have gone out a few times with a guy who is HIV positive person. 

He told me that he had a one night stand with a guy he met at a bar, and they didn't use a condom. For guys who are positive, is this how most people get it or do their partners lie to them about their status or do most people not ask before hooking up?

While I like him, I am trying my best to stay negative. I want to have oral sex with him, but not sure beyond that. I'm afraid he'll want to have sex with him without a condom. Is there an easy to bring up my concerns to him? I'm not afraid of him, but I also don't take this lightly. 

Do most HIV + guys date other positive guys? Are most people with HIV open with status or do most not know? Am I in over my head?

So I know the law here doesn't *generally* require it, but my circumstances are a little different, I think?  I'm concerned not only with legally required disclosure but with the moral side of whether I should disclose too.

I work in a pretty rough blue-collar job where we frequently get minor cuts and scrapes, since we're dealing mostly with small metal parts and piping that are often quite jagged.

My coworkers and I get cut bad enough to bleed a bit at least a few times a week.  

I've had some pretty nasty lacerations on my hands and arms in the past that have bled badly, including one a few months ago on the back of my hand that was stitched on site by one of my coworkers.  Another coworker wiped up the blood with a rag, again no gloves.  It's not uncommon for a bit of blood to get on our tools or whatever, and no one seems to show any concern about it.

I know HIV is a fragile virus that doesn't survive long outside the body, but it seems like if someone who might have open or barely-scabbed over cuts on their own hands are literally wiping up fresh HIV+ blood that there's a risk they could get infected?  Is that at all a realistic concern?

I feel like I should tell the guys I work with, but much like how I haven't come about my sexuality, I worry that it could lead me to losing my job.  It's not exactly an enlightened crowd that I work with."

I did have a sore throat about a week after sex with him, but I was coughing and sneezing some when we had sex and he got a cold a couple of days after me. So I'm too worried. The other guy scares me the most. At the time he cared about me enough that I don't think he'd lie to me, and he told me he was clean.
We had unprotected vaginal and anal sex a few times. But one day, when I didn't want to have sex he assaulted me, I guess is the best way to put it. I said no and pushed him away and he kept trying. He started anal sex without protection until I cried then he got off and left me alone. I was bleeding some after that.
That was last summer and I had a couple of partners since, but all protected. I'm currently seeking a relationship with someone and want to get tested before we get sexual, but I'm nervous I'll be positive cause I wouldn't be surprised if he lied. How can I calm down? Please help....

We've Already created synthetic Bee Venom, for larger and less expensive doses.

**Procedure** :

* Safety- Staff are to use proper safety equipment.

* Prevention- Staff must be on drug PrEP, due to high exposure.

* Patient with HIV **not aids syndrome** must not be allergic to millitin, and be young enough to tolerate treatment * for first Trials* 

* Patients must have optimal blood sugar levels and normal heart rates.

* Anesthesiologist are to put patients to sleep *treatment will be painful*

* Intensive care unit equipment must be applied to patient, **patient must have breathing support, blood sugar monitoring, epinephrine standby fluid filled for cardiovascular system standby** 

*  **intravenous infusion** Mellittin injected into blood stream *Independent Variable*.

* Treatment to be administered similar to treatment of Cancer.

* After treatment, HIV patient must be taking treatment, perhaps PrEP may be an alternative.

* HIV testing two months after treatment/s are completed.
* Record data

**Hypothesis** : Based on evidence, i'm finding treatment incredibly likely to successfully eliminate the HIV virus from patients. More information must be gathered such as dosses, how many times patients should undergo therapy, and the negative side effects of treatment. Perhaps we can create based off melittin a synthetic non allergenic, painful, or inflammation causing version. Also I believe PrEP during treatment may help the patients bodies become retarded to the HIV virus that may be lingering till the following treatments to make sure the virus does not multiply during down time. FDA approval seems likely, they've approving many things.  


May the universe bless you all, stay positive.

I found out she had an HIV+ sex partner before me and I doubt they ever used protection. All of this was unprotected and I've been sick recently. This is mostly scary because I haven't been sick since I was 12, my health is usually tip-top. My symptoms are very ARS like and I only just noticed. I'm going to go get tested today. If I am positive, I'm 3 months from being 18 and feel like waiting til then to accept treatment so I don't have to involve my mom, she's very homophobic and we've never gotten along well.

I was diagnosed about 9 months ago and have been trying to get back into dating (*actually was before my diagnosis*) and since then have been exploring the sites out there that are designed for us POZ folks. I put together a quick Imgur [preview list here](http://imgur.com/a/2QyRO) which gives you an idea of 9 that come up in Google searches all the time. If you've used them or if you just look at the image previews of their home page I just linked I think you'll get an idea of what I'm about to talk about.

**What I've found has been (IMO) wholly disappointing. Here are my reasons:**

**1)** Nearly all of them look really old and lack features you expect in a modern dating site. Some of them were even created in the late 90's and don't look like they have been updated since then. I could only find one that actually has a native iOS app and none with an Android app? Hello? People have been downloading apps to their phones since 2007!

**2)** Some kind of look scammy. For example Positives Dating, HIV People Meet and Positive Singles all look the same (*again old*) but they all say they have been featured in the same media outlets. I realize they might look the same because they are using the same back-end software but when you start making claims that you have all been featured in the same media outlets, etc. I think you are probably just making shit up. Why would I want to buy a membership to that? 

**3)** Here comes where I think I'm going to create some controversy next. There are no strong hookup apps out there. Let's face it people like to have NSA sex and that is exactly why Grindr, Tinder, etc. are all extremely popular. I feel that positive people should have all the same stuff as everyone else. 

I was trying to explain this to a friend and the only way I could put it was like this... with us POZ folk there is a moment where ""**the question**"" comes up or whatever you'd like to call it. That moment of truth where we have to disclose our status and wonder for 30 seconds if that's going to be a go or not. Explaining it to my friend I said something like:

&gt; *""it would just be really nice to have a POZ friendly hookup app where I didn't have to explain to someone my status because we are all either POZ, POZ friendly, on PrEP or whatever but the important piece is everyone using the site/app knows that going in so it moves a layer of pressure. We can take a collective sigh of relief because we know going in to the app/site that barrier is taken down.""*

**HUGE DISCLAIMER:** I am by no means saying this is an excuse to not disclose status.

**But... instead of just bitching... I have a potential solution:**

1) I'm a software guy, I've been working in tech for a long time and I know how to build this stuff. It's probably part of why I'm so frustrated with what is out there. I know it can be better. I'm half considering building a new app/site in my downtime which addresses the items I mentioned above.

The reason why I wrote all this out is I want to get a litmus check. Am I being realistic in my complaints? If I took the amount of time to build something new (*it wouldn't be trivial*) do you think other people would use it? Do you have other complaints not listed here that I should think about if I do this? 

Lastly... if I'm wrong and I'm missing a really awesome site PLEASE TELL ME where it is so I can start talking to my future boyfriend. :-)

Any advice or guidance from the community would be very much appreciated.

The reason is, I consider everybody to be HIV positive. So I always use protection. I recently met a guy that flew to see me. We have been chatting for a while and I told him we are not going to have sex. Unfortunately he was amazing to talk to, and there were sparks between us like in nuclear plant (amount of electricity). I felt strong connection so we had sex. I became suspicious he might be HIV positive, I do not know how, I only had a feeling. I do not see a reason to ask if somebody is HIV+ since I if they want, they can lie ... so I just assume they are and protect myself.

Next morning we were in bed, cuddling and talking and he said he has something to say. He said he is HIV+ and is on medication since 2012 and his viral load is undetectable. He started to explaining HIV to me, since he was scared I will run away or get angry with him, but I stopped him, saying I will be the one asking questions, not him talking. I somehow fell in love with him. He lives far away and we are not going to be in a relationship, just visiting each other from time to time, but I wonder if anybody has experience with being with hiv negative person and how this works out for you.

I was little upset he didn't tell me before we had sex, but I also was very happy he was confident enough to tell me at all - after just meeting me few hours before.

I am concerned about being HIV+ now. I will get tested in a few weeks, despite using condom, nothing is ever 100% safe. The chances are higher for me to die on bus home, than contracting HIV from him tho. I also think it is better to know somebody is HIV+ (since who would lie about being hiv+?) than being with somebody who says is not, but I never 100% know they are.

We talked for hours about his HIV status and how he is coping with it and I never felt more confident with being with another guy.

I just need to talk about it with somebody neutral, and I can't really go to my friends asking them about what they think that I had sex with hiv+ guy since I know they would think I am crazy. Am I?

The last exposure that has me worried was as a result of a broken condom on October 31. I tested on Jan 12 and it was negative, which is about 2 and a half months. My question is, how accurate is this if I were to take the test in about 2 more weeks to complete the 3 months?

It was done at Planned Parenthood with a the Rapid HIV test.

Please help...

Thanks"

He is a top if that makes a difference.

So anyways, i assumed i would be fine too, but i got the call today and i just dont know what to do. Im afraid that it might be progressed because i havent been tested in a good 6ish years. Maybe longer.

The good news is my insurance allows me to go to standford hospital, so there is that.

I feel very healthy, and i had a metabolic blood test for my gull bladder that came up healthy. I had a tooth removed a monthish ago, and it healed very quickly (Within the week). So im thinking those are good signs?

I just dont want it to be too late, ya know? I want to live a decently long life alongside my partner of whom i love very much. To top it all off my dog died not but three days ago from liver cancer.

I just need advice, i dont know what to do. The clinic does not open again until monday, so i have a day and a half of waiting before i can do anything about it.

Im very very scared."

Exactly one year ago today I was diagnosed with HIV and since that time it has been quite a year. 

Lots of ups and lots of downs but one thing I've learned is dating can be a bit more tough when you are HIV+ especially since there is so much misinformation out there. 

When you find a guy you like and you have to disclose you almost get that awkward feeling of coming out of the closet all over again. 

I've hidden my status from a lot of people for the last year but I've reached a point where I'm no longer ashamed, I'm no longer hiding and will no longer let the stigma of HIV fester because I'm going to help fight it with projects like this. 

**The Problem:**

It's no secret that the dating world can be a little tough, especially with so much misinformation out there. A lot of us, both positive and negative, have run into those situations where you meet that guy who catches your eye. You strike up a bit of conversation and when you want to take things further your presented with something that could be a bit of an awkward conversation… disclosing your HIV status. Let's make it easier by taking the fear out of the unknown. 

**The Goal:**

The whole goal is to break down barriers  and provide a quick an easy site *(with a memorable URL -  [www.undetectable.me](http://www.undetectable.me))* where you as an HIV+/Undetectable individual can provide a source of unbiased information which hits a lot of the questions someone might have about what it means to be in a serodiscordant relationship. 

**My Solution:**

I want to make that easier with a simple website that provides the **top 10** questions that might be on the mind of someone who is either HIV+/Undetectable or HIV-negative but dating is on the horizon. So, meet someone online, at a bar or somewhere else and they have limited info about what it means to be undetectable? Send them here. 

I want it to be a dead simple site that is easy to navigate on mobile and desktop with sources to good 3rd party info. I'd like it to be conversational in style instead of clinical so it appeals to the widest audience.

**Where I need your help:**

I'd like your feedback on what the top things are on your mind when dating whether you are an HIV+ man with an undetectable status or if you are HIV-negative and want to educate yourself a bit more. My humble ask if you have the time…

**1)** Review my website -&gt; [www.undetectable.me](http://www.undetectable.me) and look at the questions I have. 

**2)** Suggest changes to what is there on questions and content. I'm open to changing all questions to list. What did I miss? What concerns you? What kind of data would you like to see? BTW, I didn't fill out all the content pages yet because I know questions might change.

**3)** Tell me what you love and hate overall. **Be BRUTAL with feedback**. You aren't going to hurt my feelings. 

**A couple of caveats:**

* This is a free / non-commercial website. It's something I just started working on last night. I'm not affiliated with any special HIV/AIDS organizations, etc. It's just a personal project I think is important.

* I realize it is a bit more narrow in scope with focusing on HIV+/Undetectable gay men right now and I don't want to exclude people but I'm of the school of thought that you should start small and build from there. If this is helpful to others and successful I want to make purpose built sites like this one which address some more specific topics for other communities hit by the HIV/AIDS crisis. Please don't think I'm trying to exclude anyone. This was just an easy way to start.

* Consider this beta right now but I plan on launching it ""officially"" in a couple of days so anything is up for change. Can't say it enough... share any feedback. I'm open to change.

**Final Thoughts:**

While it's a modest site please help make this a reality by taking the time to share what you think - I know I keep saying that (sorry). Also, even though it's still just getting started feel free to share what I'm doing in your social networks, etc. so we can get more eyes and feedback on this. 

**tl;dr: I'm creating a website of 10 simple questions people might have when dating and one person is HIV+/Undetectable. The  goal is to break down barriers, help end the HIV/AIDS stigma and help people find love and companionship.**

Checking the monkeys five months later, researchers from the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center found that THC produced a generalized decrease in viral load and tissue inflammation and increased production of disease-fighting CD4 and CD8 central memory T cells in GALT.

Blocking HIV’s entry
The effects of cannabis are a result of interactions between cannabinoids and receptors located on many cells, including macrophages (a tissue cell of the immune system) and CD4 cells called cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2). Researchers at New York City’s Mount Sinai School of Medicine published data in 2012 demonstrating that stimulation of CB2 with compounds called cannabinoid receptor agonists can block the signaling process between HIV and CXCR4, one of the main types of receptors that allow HIV to enter and infect a cell. CXCR4 is used by HIV during advanced disease and allows for faster disease progression.

By stimulating activation of CB2 with cannabinoid receptor antagonists, Mount Sinai researchers decreased the ability of HIV to infect cells that utilize CXCR4, reducing the frequency of infected cells by 30 to 60 percent.""

So later in the game a player falls on the concrete floor and scrapes his hands on the floor and continues playing for a few minutes. His blood wound was fairly big on the palm of his hands on both hands and a bit dripping, he continued to touch the ball so the ball obviously had blood on it.

I am a 21 year-old gay male. I have an active sexual life for about 2 years. Although I had sex more than 10-15 times, nearly all of them was including only blowjob -both performing and receiving- and foreplay stuff like kissing, rimming etc. I have tried anal sex only 2 times as a bottom and have not enjoyed it. But the problem is that because of my unconsciousness, condoms could be broken. I am not sure whether we use water-based lubricants or oil-based ones. I do not remember.

For 6 months I have felt extremely tired, have become sick frequently and I get some enduring swollen lymph nodes constantly. I feel like I am positive. I am afraid of having a test because of my mother and father -although they are quite open-minded people, I don't want them to learn that their only child suffers from such a disease (they are not well informed about the issue)- and my social life. -I live in a religious country where people treat HIV positive ones as sinners.- I also stay in a dorm together with roommates so if one learns about it, I don't even want to think about what may happen.

But I decided to face with my fears. I will have my doctor's appointment and I will ask him for a HIV test.

I just wanted to share my situation with you. Although I have a lot of great friends, I have no one to tell about my HIV issue.

Thank you so much. Sorry for bad language."

Here's some background info first: I'm from Chile and there's very little - if any - good policy on HIV/AIDS (that is, barely any good sex ed programs and there are really no programs encouraging you to get tested, no advertising, just nothing; since Chile is a very catholic and conservative country, HIV and AIDS are highly stigmatized and so is testing). Testing for HIV/AIDS has a low cost (I think it's about 14 USD or so) but there's no such thing as the quicktests (results that you get in like 20 min or so). So I'm pretty curious about the following, 

* Is there any information about funding on HIV tests in the US (or other countries that guarantee free testing)? I.e. I'm interesting in looking up info on how these countries afford or presented an affordable program for HIV testing (what policies or programs are taking place right now in those countries that allow for a certain funding on HIV/AIDS testing which allows people to get tested for free). Also, are all of these ""free HIV testing"" quicktests or are they also lab tests (ELISA)?

Update from posts up to 04/08/16

Person A who is a child of Person B had sex with someone that lied about their HIV status and found out only after they had slept with that person.  At the same time, person A had been routinely taking a pill that prevents them from being infected with the HIV virus but happened to run out as they are only prescribed 30 at a time and they attempt to get their monthly medication but cannot due to their bank card failing that day and they had no other source of payment options and it's not $2.00 a pill, it's nearly $2,000.00 for 30 pills without insurance est.$46.00 a pill per day.  Person A went to Person B and explained the situation and offered to pay in full just that one day they were missing their pill (AKA $46.00) as missing any day can increase your chance of permanent infection.  Person B said ""Absolutely not"".  Person A asked, ""Why, I could die ultimately from this and you're saying, ""No good luck?"".  Person B says, ""Of course I won't ever do that because the pill promotes homosexual activity"".  Person A says, ""So if I get cancer and need assistance with bills you'd pay for them immediately but not for a pill that prevents your own child from ultimately dying of AIDS?""  Person B says, ""That's correct.  I'll love you to the day you die and I'll be there for you up to your last breath"".  In addition to this, a side note, doesn't this pill basically eradicate HIV in general over a time period whether you are taking part in acts they tend to think about quite often in their own spare time or you were simply pricked with a needle at a lab?

Most importantly there is not one single prescription non-insured membership coupon discount card available to date that knocks the majority of the pricing of the medication to near-0 or even in the few $100's, $200's, $300's ranges."

Despite advice from my doc to remain calm, I'm freaking out a bit. Three days ago I went to a new doctor for a routine physical. He suggested getting a blood panel done because they didn't have anything on file for me and it would be good to have on the record. I felt fine and he said I was in good physical health.

Fast forward a few days - he called me this morning letting me know that my HIV screening came back positive.  After questioning me about my history, he reassured me that it was likely a false positive, but that they were running a secondary test on the sample to be certain.

He called me back a few hours later letting me know that after speaking with the lab, the result was not positive but ""inconclusive or indeterminate.""  He said ""this happens sometimes and it almost always comes back negative, especially for people with no risk factors.""  He told me he will have results for me on Sunday.

Just for the record - I am a straight male and have been with the same sexual partner for 7+ years. I have never used IV drugs and have donated blood on a number of occasions since I've been with my partner. I understand that I would have been contacted about inconclusive or positive results when I donated blood in the past.

I went down in her beforehand (unprotected), and fingered her after.  I noticed after that she was bleeding a little bit.  I bite my nails, and I've read that biting your nails can increase your risk for infections because it causes micro cuts in your fingernails.

The next morning, two lymph nodes in my neck swole up really big, and about three days later a sore showed up on my face and neck.  It looked like Staph infection (which I've had plenty of times before because I do BJJ).  However, I went to the doctor, and it tested negative for Staph.  The sore didn't look like an HIV rash, and it was isolated to a few spots...also was very itchy and had a lot of pus, swole up really badly on my neck, and popped up one-two small spots on my leg and hands, but those went away very quickly.

I know symptoms of HIV usually start much later than that, but is it possible for the nodes to swell up the day after infection?  I am 100% going to get tested; I just want to know if I can get tested now instead of waiting for month 3, since I have already gotten the ""symptoms"".

Thanks!"

I have been experiencing flu-like symptoms for the past two days and I am not sure whether it is because of the flu, or if it is the beginning of HIV. About a month ago, I was sexually assaulted and I have no idea as to what that person's status is. On the other hand, my brother currently has Swine Flu, which I know is very contagious. 

Weird thing is though, I am feeling pretty good today. My fever broke... I did have some diarrhea this morning but now I feel entirely fine besides being a little tired, and I am not on medication yet (have a prescription for tamaflu that I need to get).

Is it normal to feel better so quickly with no meds? Maybe it's something else? Does HIV symptoms come and go quickly?

Please just tell me my immune system is amazing."

About a month ago I got tested for STDs and found that I had chlamydia. I'd had sex with two people unprotected over for about a month prior to being tested. The doctor said I might as well test for HIV so he took a vial of my blood and performed the antibody/antigen test with that sample. I came up positive for antibodies and negative on the antigen. That same sample was then used to perform a western blot test. After a week that test came up negative and the doctor said I was in the clear.

Today I've been reading about the western blot test and the idea that it may not be accurate if someone has contracted HIV recently. Should I get tested again soon? It's been about a month since I was tested for HIV. The doctor told me that he was certain I didn't have it, but from what I've read online it sounds like he may be wrong to be so certain.

I found out while in the hospital for kidney pain and it was discovered that the source was the HIV virus in my system. I began medication thanks to the Atlanta Aid program. which helped me get medication fast. Iam very grateful for that. Really to be honest once the pain in my side left me soon after the hospital stay. I did not notice ANY thing else my viral load low was just starting. so I had recently have the virus in my system. (so i also know how i got the virus. from my last girlfriend.) we have since had a sit down 5 months after my discovery I was very mad at first but it not like its going back after this so and negative energy would not help the situation either now. But asfar as my health really nothing has changed in fact i have actually been watching what I eat more and all I have to do extra is take one pill a day. that's it. HIV does effect my life as far as dating but iam taking a break from that now to focus on my self. I really do hate the stigma that comes with the whole HIV positive thing. But I just have to be strong for me and my family and take care of my self so I can be here for them for many years to come. as of now iam stronger than have built more muscle than I ever have and weight in at 240 lb and very fit and I intend to stay this way. 

to any one out there that reads this and is a heterosexual male that has HIV Be strong my brother. live a Positive life, Dont let negativity ruin the light within you. there is a woman out there that will accept you. 

in fact i have disclosed my status to two women that where attracted to me and after a few days (of them doing research about HIV) they accepted me.

This is not the end but new chapter of knowing you status and taking charge of your health and well being."

* The spam filter seems to be triggered by the topic of HIV/AIDS.  Check to make sure your post actually appears under new, and message the moderators if it does not!

**Am I infected??? / What are my chances???**

Such questions are considered *off-topic* for this community.  We receive them regularly.  More often than not, we cannot give a meaningful answer.  Such posts have become incredibly repetitive.  

In about 95% of cases, the answers needed boils down to ""No, oral sex is not risky.   Yes, everything else is a potential risk.  No, we can't tell you what your 'odds'  are.  Yes, you should get tested.  Talk to your doctor if you have other health-related questions.  Random people online cannot assuage your irrational anxieties."" 

The moderators will remove such posts and a comment will be left linking to this thread.  Examples of posts which have been removed recently: 

* I've been tested before, but I'm worried that I could've contracted HIV
* What are my chances?
* I don't know what to do...
* Feeling really sick two days after
* Anxiety and paranoia
* U think I'm at risk?

I am currently living in Toronto, I used to be an international student but now I'm done with school and working towards permanent residency in Canada. I came from a homophobic country and even in Canada, I am still not out to my friends. I should also mention that I don't come from a rich family and the only reason I ever made it to Canada was because I won a scholarship to study here.

Last time I checked for HIV, it was two years back, the results came back negative but ever since then, I have been very promiscuous and have had multiple unprotected sexual encounters with many men. There was never a discussion for HIV before sex (sometimes yes but I really don't know if these people were telling the truth) and I am usually the penetrated partner (bottom). I know my actions were really stupid but my counselor stated that my double life (pretending to be straight) is taking a toll on me and I am constantly depressed from my studies that I always find sex as a form of escapism. I think I might be a sex addict but I'm not sure. Not to mention, condom hurts my butt so much.

Okay, no more excuses. The reason why I want to check now is because now that I'm done with my studies, I hope my newly improved mental health condition will help me to cope if I ever get diagnosed with HIV. But apparently, I'm not really sure anymore, it turns out it's really hard to get a job (affecting my mental health really negatively) and I am faced with a new reality that I haven't thought of before, that HIV medication may not be available to non-citizens like me. Another reason is also because if I ever get to be a PR in Canada, I need to prove that I am not going to be a burden to Canada's healthcare system and being undetectable probably is the least of burden so it's something that I have to work for too if I have HIV.

So here's the case. I am not sure if I will be able to get HIV medication or even afford it (considering it's hard to get jobs, I may have to settle for part time jobs that do not have medical coverage) and really, the most important thing is whether if I could cope emotionally with having the disease. I am really at the lowest point of my life here and I don't know if I could even continue with life if I have HIV. Should I still go for the test? 

But again, this is all assuming if I have HIV, I don't know if I have HIV, I don't show any visible symptom and live healthily mostly (lifestyle outside of sex is kinda healthy, workout, control diet etc). Should I?"

My family currently lives in Atlanta, and we are looking at North Georgia and W.North Carolina to relocate. Georgia is not ideal, but at least it is the known quantity.

Only 1 in 250,000 heterosexual males are diagnosed a year. He is 

* 25 years old
* Male (heterosexual, never experimented)
* 6 foot
* 190 lbs
* Caucasian
* Only had unprotected sex with 4 women since his last STD check 2 years ago.
* No blood transfusions ever

He's been in prison for about 6 months now. He believed his thyroid might be messed up due to his chronic drug abuse. He has used everything from mdma to cocaine to steroids. He's never used IV drugs. Anyway, they tested his thyroid and a few other things and diagnosed him with HIV. As stated before the odds of this for a straight male in his country are insanely low. The quality of the healthcare system is good in the country but horrible in the prison. 

He's had 2 ""reactive"" tests so far - the nurse won't tell him exactly what test it was, but they were both done with blood and both in the same type of tube - googling tells me it was likely an ELISA test. He's since had more blood taken to get a HIV viral count which he's expecting next week or so. 

From what I was reading online I found that normally a ""western blot"" test is recommended after a positive ELISA, but it sounds like they just did the ELISA test twice. Is this standard practice, or what is the standard practice here and why? From reading online a false positive ELISA test is about 15 per 10,000 which seems a bit more likely than 1 in 250,000.

His CD4 level was 496 - the normal range is 500 to 1500. His only 'symptom' really is slightly enlarged lymphnodes in the neck. He's lost a lot of weight the last few months (hates the food), isn't sleeping well and has a lot of anxiety.... but that could all be due to him being in prison.

The week after his second 'reactive' test they tested him on a whole bunch of other things - syphillips, gonorrhea, hepatitis, a whole bunch of other things (again he doesn't know exactly what and they won't tell him). He came back negative on everything else, although he did have a 'slightly low platelete count'.

As said before he's expecting his viral count next week - but they said even if this comes back as 0 he should still begin medication as often the count can be undetectable.

I have the following questions:

* Is it standard practice to run 2 ELISA tests? Or should they be two different tests?
* Is there anything else (especially drug abuse) that could cause false positives? 
* If his CD4 is *just* below minimum and he comes back as 0 on the viral count, then is it standard practice to begin him on medication just based on 2 ELISA tests?
* What should he ask to be done?

I'm asking these questions on behalf of him as obviously he has no internet and he has only had a 3 minute meeting with a doctor about this whole thing. "

I feel really insecure about my body. I feel so ugly that I feel like I'm drowning. My self-hatred burns white hot. This causes me to self isolate badly. After self isolating for years and being unable to feel comfortable with affection I was about to crack in the lonliness. So I started talking to this guy online. He wanted to meet up. I desperately wanted affection. Just to feel somebody touch me. He promised me that he was clean. I go to his house. We start touching on each other. He then wants to bend me over but I don't feel comfortable doing that. He insist and I do it anyways. He inserts and I start to pull away and tell him to stop. He then grabs my hips and rapidly thrust as I hesitantly try to pull away. After about 6-7 quick thrust he dumps his load. I then leave. 6 months later I find out he has HIV. I try to contact him and he completely ignores me. So I went to get tested. I won't know the results until Tuesday. That's tomorrow. I can't stop crying. I could kill myself for being so stupid and foolish. Why would I do this. The one time I have a random hook up. The one time I leave my isolation. I probably get HIV. I keep telling myself I don't have it. But I'm pretty sure that I do. I had ""early symptoms"" which include sore throat and flu like symptoms. I had thought I wasn't feeling well. It was likely the HIV. Why would I let some random dude fuck me. I can't believe I've done this to myself. I'm so scared Reddit. I just know the results are going to be positive. But maybe it was just a regular flu? I don't know. The waiting is killing me.









UPDATE: The results were negative. I do not have HIV. I want to thank you guys so much. Sincerely, thank you so much for all the patience and kindness and understanding during my panic. During the last couple of days I have learned so much about HIV/AIDS and the HIV/AIDS community and world ""HIV/AIDS"" day has a completely different new meaning to me now. While I did not contract HIV I have a admiration for you guys that are living with this illness. You guys are some kickass motherfuckers and I admire your strength. Really, though. I love you guys and thanks for helping me through this HIV scare. I'm sending love and peace to each and every one of y'all. Bless y'all. "

Currently, the cost of medicine in india is about ₹4000 or $60 a month (30 tablets). I checked the medicine I have been recently put on [Efavirenz (600mg), Lamivdine (300mg) and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (300mg)] and the cost for this medicine in the USA appears to be anywhere between $3000-4000 (30 tablets). Considering not everyone in the US would be paying that amount for anti- retro-viral drugs, how then is the system currently operating? Basically I would assume most of this is being covered by health insurance companies, which, undoubtedly would have a higher premium for positive patients than anyone else. 
How does this operate on immigrants (people who would travel to US for work/study). Could a rough breakup of the costs be given?

I am very confused and this little piece of information would really help me help me ease a lot of stress. "

I'm 21 years old and I'm a documentary filmaker. I'm also an athletic guy who pratice weightlifting since 3 years ago. I got 82 kilograms and 185 cm height. 
I can say I'm attractive guy that can make relationhips easily. I got self-confidence and I usually dress well. 
The question is, due this particulary situation, I've got some female partners all over my life. And with some of them (5 women) I made sex with no condom at least one time per women (but only ejaculated at once). I do not remember of getting the called hiv early synthoms like long time flu, cold, rash... Since 2 years to now I only got caught with a flu that took at least one week (I've got in bed during seven days, and it hapenned 3 months after a sexual risk situation). 
Five months ago, Ive got a girlfriend. I really love her. She's perfect. We made sex without condom since the second month that we got together. 
My fear is the chances to got hiv and had passed to my girlfriend. This is a trauma to me. I'm trying to not think about this but is impossible. 
Otherwise, I think this is most anxiety, because she did not got sick due this time with me. (She is a person that is really vulnerable of infections like flues and colds).

I confess that I'd never tried a HIV test due my fear but now I think is the time to do that. 

What do you think about this situation, Reddit users? Thank you.

I've been recently diagnosed with HIV. I understand that there have been several lapses in my treatment; namely: I haven't established baseline viral load and CD4/8, haven't had baseline BUN, creatinine, as well as SGPT and SGOT counts. I have had the routine chest X-Ray, CBC's, SE's and UA's. I started my treatment 10 days ago today.

I'm on a combination therapy: efaviranz, lamivudine, and tenofivir disoproxil fumarate pill(once a day at the same time everyday) and on PTB prophylactic treatment: Isoniazid(as PTB isn't a rarity in my country). My treatment is free. I get it from a social hygiene clinic once a month(for the first six months, im told) then every three months onwards.

Still feel as though I should've had a viral load and CD4/8 taken though. The problem was that my clinic's machine got broken and my doctor wanted to get me on treatment regardless - and I agreed on the importance of getting on the therapy ASAP. Now, as I understand, CD4/8 counts are not free in most countries (it is, in the Philippines). However, I reckon I will have to have those labs taken before I go overseas for a new professional appointment in the U.K. Reckon I will have no choice if the clinic still fails to offer them in the dates leading to it.. they're are pretty expensive 😔 

What I need to know is: how is the treatment in the U.K.?? How are the meds? The laboratories? I will, basically, be an overseas worker and, as such, I have no idea if I will be covered by government subsidies(if it works that way) or if I will have to pay for everything out of pocket. Also, could anyone please give me a rough estimate of treatment costs if I had to pay for it myself ...? ☺️


As a side note: I know how low, how worthless the condition makes people feel like. Please don't hesitate to talk to me if you just need someone. I'm always here 👐🏿👐🏾👐🏽👐🏼👐🏻"

I posted a little while back about my survey and want to extend a huge thanks to all who have taken it so far - it's been enlightening! The designers of the app were focusing quite a bit on the goal-tracking aspect, but we've found already that people are far more interested in tracking CD4 count and Viral Load, nutrition, as well as being able to share data with healthcare professionals and connect with other HIV+ people.

For any Londoners living with HIV, I'm also conducting interviews for anyone that's interested in taking a bit of time to try out the app and just share your thoughts on what you really want out of technology in order to help manage your health information and improve overall quality of life. If you're over 18+, HIV+ and in London or don't mind travelling in, I'd love to speak with you! You can send me a PM or email me at: **beyouplusstudy@gmail.com**

Re-posting my survey link for anyone who missed it the first go-round:

&gt; As part of my Master's dissertation in HCI and in partnership with the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital Foundation Trust, I am evaluating BeYou+, a mobile app designed to provide individuals who are HIV+ with reliable information about their body, mind, and life.

&gt; **Whether you are a current user of BeYou+ or just interested in self-management and health**, I would like to hear from you and better understand what you need in order to manage your health information.

&gt; The survey will take 15 minutes or less to complete, and by participating you will help improve the state of mobile technology for people living with HIV.

So I'll start off by saying I almost never post on Reddit and have only been looking through this subreddit for a couple days. My name is Paul Struck, and I'm a 21-year-old journalism major/political science minor at Roger Williams University in Bristol, RI USA. I'm writing my senior thesis on HIV/AIDS as well as their impact on the gay community. I'll be researching the history of the virus, the 1980s epidemic and the politics of the time, and the current state of affairs including the disease's relationship with methamphetamine addiction among gay men.

I'm looking for someone in the Connecticut/Massachusetts/Rhode Island area, preferably a gay man in his 20s who is HIV positive that I could meet up with and speak to maybe a couple times over the course of this fall. Essentially, I'm looking for a ""face"" for my story. If you even somewhat fit this description or knows someone who does and would like to speak with me, let me know! I would like to get to know you and learn about what an HIV positive life has meant for you. This would be in addition to interviews I have with public health officials and activists, etc.

My goal in doing this is to localize my story which is clearly a national issue, and to get a more intimate perspective on life with HIV in the 21st century. This may include obstacles you've faced such as finances, medical complications and general social stigma. However, it may also include triumphs. It would add a credible and authentic voice to my piece which will be of a long form, Wall Street journal-style journalistic nature. 

I've grown passionate about this topic in the past year or so, and knew that I wanted to write about it this fall. I feel it would bring awareness to an issue that many people believe is behind us, and it would give a voice to those who don't feel they have been heard. If anyone has ANY questions, comments or suggestions relating to how I may find someone to speak to, I encourage you to get in touch with me! If you want to personally contact me and don't want to comment on this, you can reach me at my email...

He contracted it less than a year ago and is taking ART. He's in great health. 

From my readings it seems as though modern medicine is great and keeping things under control, but I have a few questions, as some articles are unclear or contradictory. I'm a female by the way, I know this makes a difference 


-Can I contract from giving head without a condom? What about giving head to completion? 

-With ART and condoms, is it likely I won't contact anything or should I see a dr about getting PrEP?

-if semen gets on sheets/blankets do I need to be careful gathering them for washing? Only if I have an open wound, right?

Can I hopefully consider it an indication that I'm disease free? Last time I had (goddamn it) unprotected sex was august 3. So it should have affected my blood count if I was affected right? or is the CBC not an indicator? Im soooo worried im hoping for the best.
5abfxq,Unprotected sex/HIV scare,https://www.reddit.com/r/hivaids/comments/5abfxq/unprotected_sexhiv_scare/,oreganosoprano,0,2016-10-31 03:08:42,2,/r/hivaids/comments/5abfxq/unprotected_sexhiv_scare/,NaN,"I realize this might be a cliche post but I've searched through other posts and read the side bar and still have questions. 

A little over a month ago I had sex for the first time. Didn't really know the guy that well and we had only talked for a couple weeks beforehand. Yes it was anal, no we did not use protection or lubricant, I get that that was idiotic. In the weeks we talked before sex we talked about our past history. He said he'd never gone full way with someone and was still a virgin. 

About a week later I came down with a bad cold and skipped a couple of classes at school. 3 weeks later (last week) I had a horrible sore throat, drainage, queasy stomach, dark snot, etc. Basically the signs of a nasal infection. Skipped two days of classes I was so miserable (I never skip class). Starting to feel better after 5 days of that and now I think I have pink eye (going to the on-campus nurse for that tomorrow). 

After being sick for the first time, I brought up our past sexual history again with the guy in a nonchalant way, asking if I should invest in condoms. He got a little sketchy and said he'd have to ""think about it."" A day or so later he said he'd never gone as far as we had. He's told me a lot of crazy stories about his past high-school days, some of which I'm pretty sure are lies, so I can't really tell if he was being truthful. 

So my questions are these: is this myriad of illnesses something I should be worried about or do you think it's just coincidental? If I should be concerned, I'm having trouble telling where exactly I can get testing and what that would look like. I've been searching the web and I'm confused on the results. If I get tested in a hospital would the test be covered by insurance (under my father) and would it show up on any insurance statements that my parents might see? I come from very conservative/religious household and I'm scared to see their reaction if they knew I had had sex or have HIV. My school is very conservative and Christian (along with almost all my friends) and having sex on campus is a big no no. I don't really have anyone to turn to right now and I'm feeling pretty alone and scared. 

I really do apologize if this post is offense to anyone HIV+, I don't mean to minimize your situations and I don't believe HIV is the end of the world. If this is the wrong place for this post, I'd be thankful if you could point me in the right direction. Thanks for reading my novel."

Now I'm 22 and questioning it more than ever.

I'm depressed and unhappy with life.

I have a girlfriend that lives with me at my parents house who I don't think I'm in love with anymore. So it's kind of annoying her being there and having no space for myself.
Also I'm scared if I leave her I won't find another partner accepting of my hiv.

We haven't had sex in weeks. I just have no desire to, which is awfully weird.

I dropped out of school, have a lousy minimum wage job with an asshole for a manger and in debt. (Not that much)

I binge drink and smoke everyday for an artificial ""happy time"" but that only last a couple of hours before I come down.

The last 9 years of my life has been happy. I feel like it's not going to change and living for 20+ years unhappy in just torturing myself.

Is it worth it with the struggle later down the road with health problems and it being hard to find a significant other.


Any advice??

I posted a little bit ago about my survey and again would like to thank everyone who took the time to respond. I understand you all must be survey'd out a lot of the time, so it means a lot. :-) 

As a refresher, as a part of my Master's dissertation in HCI and in partnership with the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital Foundation Trust, I am evaluating BeYou+, a mobile app designed to provide individuals who are HIV+ with reliable information about their body, mind, and life. 

I realize quite a lot of you hadn't heard of the app before or didn't want to pay for it, so as the last (promise!) part of my dissertation research, I've created a quick final survey that will let people who haven't downloaded BeYou+ get a chance to see the app and quickly rate what you think of some of the features. The questionnaire will take **less than 10 minutes**, and will help inform the design of BeYou+, as well as any other future apps for people living with HIV.


**The survey can be found here:** https://qlite.az1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_7QljLer8pHknlfD

And for any Londoners living with HIV, I'm also conducting interviews for anyone that's interested in taking a bit of time to try out the app and just share your thoughts on what you really want out of technology in order to help manage your health information and improve overall quality of life. If you're over 18+, HIV+ and in London or don't mind travelling in, I'd love to speak with you! You can send me a PM or email me at: beyouplusstudy@gmail.com

and again after that i took 2 rapid tests and the result was negative too.
But i was not satisfied with those results and I got tested again and that was negative(the test was hiv elisa 3rd generation).
I am suffering from anxiety and depression over my symptoms, I had an ear infection 4month ago(I have never had ear infection since my childhood) and my ears are ringing all the time,and I can feel 3nodes in my neck and I think they are swollen but I am not pretty sure of that.Additionaly I have read somewhere that  very rare cases that are infected with hiv do not produce antibodies and I think maybe I am one of those rare cases!please help me these thoughts have taken over my life,I am fed up please help me!do you think I need a combo test or what??(by the time,I have not had any sexual encounter except that one)

Currently, the cost of medicine in india is about ₹4000 or $60 a month (30 tablets). I checked the medicine I have been recently put on [Efavirenz (600mg), Lamivdine (300mg) and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (300mg)] and the cost for this medicine in the USA appears to be anywhere between $3000-4000 (30 tablets). Considering not everyone in the US would be paying that amount for anti- retro-viral drugs, how then is the system currently operating? Basically I would assume most of this is being covered by health insurance companies, which, undoubtedly would have a higher premium for positive patients than anyone else. 
How does this operate on immigrants (people who would travel to US for work/study). Could a rough breakup of the costs be given?

I am very confused and this little piece of information would really help me help me ease a lot of stress."

About 3 months later I got a sore throat (however I always do when I get sick) but thought nothing of it. A few weeks after my sickness I managed to get another sore throat and also fatigue and minor headaches from times. Again, thought nothing of it. Finally, 3-4 weeks after my 2nd time being ill in a unusually short period of time I got a sore throat once again.
At the moment I'm really trying to convince myself it's all fine and I'm planning on taking a test within these next couple of weeks. Here's the problem though, i smoke weed regularly and in my coubtry it's highly illegal. So my question is basicly this: when taking an HIV test will THC show up as a part of it or am I good to go right now?

Also if you have any other information to share please do, as I only have some basic knowledge that google gave me."

After a few days i noticed around two little pimples on my penis that looked like they may have always been there and a new one developed as well a few days later. I began feeling a slight tingling and burning sensation in my genitals that comes and goes but not seriously and has lasted up until now when I am writing this post. I got white sores in my mouth that hurt (or clear sores). They went away after going to the hospital and getting Valacyclovir and taking it for 10 days. The bumps on the penis stayed and the last one i mentioned came after going and getting the valacyclovir. The swab I got came back negative for herpes. After going to get the swab and valacyclovir the back of my tongue hurt and I had a rash that only tingled a bit and lasted around a day. My stomach also began hurting a few days ago but came and went and not that noticeable it was nothing extremely serious like with the tingling sensation i mentioned earlier. I also had light fevers come and go. When I got in contact with her she said she had to go to the hospital previously for a stomach problem. I have posted on this thread previously and I am going to get tested this morning but just wanted to hear what you guys think, hope it comes back negative and I have something that is possibly curable."

When we started seeing each other, we both took HIV tests (colloidal gold test kit) and both came back negative. I also just took a test kit recently and came back negative as well. And so now I'm scared that I might get it as well. We had sex a total of two times since he says he doesn't really like doing it (tmi haha). Both times we used condoms and he was on top (both times cumming outside). The last time was about three months ago. How long does it take to be able to detect HIV? I know I should go to a hospital to get checked and since I'm an expat, I am currently broke and am waiting for payday to have money to get checked out. 

I need some reassurance :( Is the home test kit at all accurate? Is there a chance that I can also contract HIV? 

No matter what my result is, I still love him and still want to be with him. If I'm negative, are there any steps we can take to prevent spreading the virus to me or throughout his body?

That said, I never once had unprotected sex. And I'm so overly paranoid about sex that I would almost always check the condom afterward to be sure it was intact. I know I was using the right kind of lube, nothing that would compromise the strength of the condoms. 

The only thing I can think of is that I like to douche before sex. That's kind of how I now assume I contracted the disease... That my douching gave me some micro-abrasion internally and condoms are only 95% effective.

Finding out I was positive came as a shock, obviously. My mom committed suicide three weeks later though, which meant having HIV and taking my medication went from new and unusual to part of my routine pretty quickly because everything else was thrown upside down.

I want to be upset about it sometimes, but now I just kind of think that I took every precaution I could possibly take outside of abstinence and still got infected. So maybe it was my destiny, you know? 

Anyone else have a similar story?

Two weeks ago today I had sex with a trans sex worker, with her bottoming, I obviously wore a condom to begin with. However, when I told her I was close I withdrew and took the condom off. She was aware I did this and then sat on top of me and put me back inside. I realised that she had done this and could only have been inside for maximum of a minute before asking her to stop this, without finishing inside her. Should I realistically be worried? On further reading I have found out about PEP but I only found out about this too late. I am going to get tested in two more weeks as before 4 the reading is too inaccurate. If any one can help with this I would be greatly appreciative."
5x0qsc,48 hrs of Being HIV Positive,https://www.reddit.com/r/hivaids/comments/5x0qsc/48_hrs_of_being_hiv_positive/,TardisTuesday,14,2017-03-01 19:00:37,13,/r/hivaids/comments/5x0qsc/48_hrs_of_being_hiv_positive/,NaN,"It's now March 1st, 2017; just two days after I've been diagnosed. Two days since I felt as though my life had shattered. 48 hours since I've been diagnosed as HIV+. It still hasn't sunken in yet. 

Just two days ago, I went to get tested. It's something that a socially responsible person should do, every 3 months. I went in thinking ""I'll be fine""; but that wasn't the case. I spent four hours at the clinic. The phlebotomist drawing 7 vials of my blood for testing. The doctor giving me a physical, then walking me through the steps of taking my meds for the first time. The social workers helping me find long term care. It was overwhelming. 

I left the clinic, and immediately called two very close friends of mine. I told them that I needed to see them, because I was freaking out. One said they'd be free for happy hour drinks, so I told them to where to meet me. I walked from Morningside, to Hell's Kitchen. 

I remember walking through the park, feeling the sun shining, seeing people moving through their own lives, and then there was me... Dragging my feet, kicking myself. I remember that night. I remember when, where, how, and who. I kicked myself for not getting tested right after it happened. I wished he was still alive, so that I could just talk to him. Tell him what happened. Try to see if he knew. 

I remember sitting at the bar, halfway through my first beer as my friend walked in. We sat together at a table... We exchanged small talk, caught up on what was happening throughout the past week, and then I told him. He didn't change his reaction at all, he just joked with me and reminded me that he's always gonna be my big bro. I felt thankful. I felt a small amount of the weight that was on my shoulder, be lifted. 

Later that night, I saw another friend of mine, who is poz. I needed to talk to someone who's been through what I'm going through. He told me the same thing that I told him when I find out; ""you'll be okay, we'll be okay"". It was exactly what I needed to hear. We talked about the meds, and how he dealt with things. He also explained to me that it's best to just let the news work it's way through my brain, and hang in there. Just the hugs, him holding my hand, and joking with me... It made me feel safe. I didn't want to let go, but I had to when I did; otherwise, I would've broken down. 

I still can't sleep though. I feel my mind stressing out as I close my eyes. Last night, I threw a fit because the pen that I was using while I was writing died out. I threw it across the room, and kept yelling ""fuck"". I'm not the best with emotions. I don't cry, I don't get angry, I just put up a wall. Don't touch me, don't talk to me, don't look at me. I process shit on my own, then move forward. I find a way to just turn it into ""water off a duck's back"". But this is different... This, is scary. This is life or death. 

Granted, I keep hearing ""You live in NYC, the best city when being diagnosed""; I still can't properly process this. Maybe it's because I haven't officially let it sink in yet. But, how do you let something like this sink in? How do you get yourself from thinking about this nonstop? Especially, when everyday you're required to take pills that remind as to WHY you're taking them?

It's frightening. I know I'll be okay, because that's my nature... to be okay. But, I'm scared. Not of dying, just of how this will effect future me. Of how people will perceive me when I tell them. Of how my mother will react. Of how I will eventually come to perceive myself. 

I only know that my truth has a new characteristic.

It was a craigslist hookup and he said that he was neg so my dumb ass just went with it. The actual intercourse wasn't that long. I topped and I would say I was inside of him for a total of 4 minutes.

I was on r/askgaybros when I saw a post about a guy with hiv I clicked on it, read it and got really anxious. So anxious that for the next hour I searched up early symptoms of hiv. It's been 3 weeks since I've hooked up with the guy and currently ""sick"". I only have one slightly stuffed nose, slight pressure in head, some excess mucous and only sneeze like twice a day. Other than thst im perfectly okay. I'm worried that this might be the beginning of the flu like symptoms. 

I was so anxious that I was breathing weird and basically having a small anxiety attack. I message the guy and he said he was neg and got tested in december. That he mostly topped and and used protection and I had nothing to worry about. Obviously this did little to comfort me. I'm getting tested at my campus on tuesday because it's basically my only option. Honestly scared that it might come back positive. 

I feel so stupid for being stupid and not repecting myself enough to use protection. What will I do if I am positive how will I pay for medicine or doctor bills. I'm a struggling college student who works at McDonald's. I just have so much emotions that I just can't handle. I'm sorry for being whiny I just needed to vent and someone to talk to."

We work for the Center for Gender, Sexuality and HIV Prevention at Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago. We are in our last phase of recruitment, and we're currently enrolling male couples in mixed HIV status relationships in a HIV medication adherence counseling study. You will be compensated for your time (up to $700 per couple) and receive free HIV and STI testing.

Here are the details:

**Eligibility:** 18 years or older, cis-gender men in same-gender-loving relationships with men who have a different HIV status than your own, and live in the Chicago land area (within a 50-mile radius from downtown; you must be able to travel to our office in Uptown). All relationship types are welcomed; you could be dating, living together, married, or maybe you just started something!

**What you do:** Complete an online pre-screener at www.strongertogether.us to see if you are eligible. If you and your partner are eligible, you'll be invited to come into our office to complete additional surveys and HIV and STI testing (includes blood draw and finger prick) and counseling.

**Compensation:** Each person will receive $50 for each completed appointment (If you are eligible, you and your partner could be invited to come back every 6 months, up to 24 months).

If you or someone you know may be interested in joining or want to learn more about this study, you can email us at strongertogetherchicago@gmail.com or text/call us at 331-248-1921.

A few nights ago he confided in me that he contracted HIV from his previous partner. It's all very well managed, he takes his medication, it's not a resistant strain, and it's no longer detectable in his blood.  It's been a very long time since I've had ""feelings"" for someone and I don't see his HIV as being a reason to run away. I really admire him for telling me early.  

I've been doing my own research into it and asking him lots of questions. However, I don't want our time together to be dominated by HIV talk. He's been transparent with me about it all and we both have backgrounds in science which helps in understanding. I just don't want to overload him with questions and neglect normal conversation. I want to keep getting to know him as any normal person.

Has anyone else on here have a HIV positive partner? I pretty much want to know absolutely everything there is to know about it. I know in his case there is a very low risk of transmission, plus if/when the time comes, we would use condoms. If a condom broke I'd probably look into PREP (tho, at this stage all information is new to me).

I had a protected sex with and unprotected oral sex with a prostitute. Few hours after my body temperature increased to 37.3- 37.4 celsius degrees. Otherwise I feel completely fine - I just feel my face to be a bit warmer and this ""burning ears"" sensation. Sometimes the temperature returns to its normal normal level and sometimes it increases again (max 37.5). This has been going on for a 7 days. Is it possible, that I have contracted HIV ? I would really be glad for any answer. Thank you"

To copy and paste it here:
&gt;Throwaway because why not.

&gt;Today I recieved a letter from my local plasma donation place that told me I have to come down as soon as I get a chance to talk to their nurse. She informed me that my primary screening had tested positive, but more in depth second testing was negative for HIV. This also happened to me back in 2014 when I was just donating blood, although the letter I received that time told me it was likely the fault of the blood donation service. Just to be clear, both times I have been told that I very more than likely do not have the virus. Either way, I went to my local Planned Parenthood, where my Rapid Test was negative, but they still sent two vials of my blood out to the lab.

&gt;I have never had sexual contact, outside of fingering a girl back in my sophomore year of High School. I have never shared needles, and never have had any symptoms of HIV or AIDS, at least according to what the nurses at the Plasma place and PP told me.

&gt;Does anyone know exactly whats up? I'm definitely very scared, because I understand that theres a one in infinite chance that I somehow got the virus, but as the saying goes, theres a chance. Is the Rapid test from PP reliable? Is there something thats tripping the screening they do at the Plasma place/Blood place every time?

&gt;edit: clarification 

&gt;edit 2: removed some terms I may have possibly misused, adding confusion

So yeah. Is it just insanely bad luck? I have also confirmed since then that the second test the Plasma Place used was the Western Blot. Is there a specific specialist I should go see?"

She won't tell me how she got it exactly, and I won't ask her. That's her business and I do not want to pry or cause her anymore stress at this time. But I need to know, how can I help her and be a good sister from so far away? She lives in Washington and I live in Nevada. I have been reading on facts and research on HIV because I want to be informed, but is there anything else I can do to help her?

However, I removed my gloves and inspected my hand anyway just to be sure. It didn't seem like the needle caused me to bleed but I just went and washed my finger off anyway. I had a little bit of pain in the area where the needle poked me for a couple days after the incident. Today I told a group of friends and they all gave me a bunch of conflicting accounts of the risk and it's been giving me a little bit of anxiety so I decided to come on here to find some answers.

I apologize if it isn't. But I desperately need help.

I need to get an HIV test asap. I have a hunch (maybe paranoid, I just don't know) that I may have been exposed a few months ago and it just clicked in my head today. I'm straight up panicking. I'm in NC, Charlotte area. (Again, don't know if I should disclose that but whatever I guess. I'm anonymous here) 

I know of a clinic a town over from me that I can have this test done for free but I need a way there. I don't drive and I don't have family or friends to ask for help. My parents can't know that I'm doing this and they'd be my only option of getting there. This clinic offers free hiv testing M-F.

Does anyone know of any resources that could help me get there discreetly other than like uber or lyft? I don't really know how to go about this and I'm such a nervous wreck I don't really know where to turn.

Thanks so much in advance for reading, and again, I'm truly sorry if this kind of thing has no place here. I'm just kind of desperate. "

Last year I was reading an article about HIV and it mentioned seroconversion or something like this.  I went to Google what hiv seroconversion is and I learned that it is flu like symptoms after being exposed and infected with HIV.  

This had me casting my mind back to a previous encounter I had back in summer time of 2011.  I was with a new man and we spent a night together.  We didn't have intercourse but we get up to some other play like bondage and spanking with me being on the receiving end.  There were other sexual activities but it was light like he fingered me and I gave a blow job and some cum came into my mouth.  

Not even 5 days after our encounter I became sick.   I was out for lunch and became full and nauseous.  Within 2 hours, I was vomiting.   That sickness lasted a few days with a sore and aching body.  I thought it was food poisoning and I put it down to that.  
At some stage after that, I went back to the establishment I ate in and had a dessert and the dairy in the dessert was very off. 

Then I read that piece about HIV and seroconversion and there was something in my mind - what if that was HIV and not food posioning.  

I meant to organise an sti test but I never got around to doing it yet since reading the piece.   2016 was a busy year for me and I put it to the back of my mind but it still sometimes plays on my mind.  

I have a new boyfriend now and I would never be able to live with myself if I had HIV and I passed it onto him.   I've been meaning to get tested over the past month but the country where I am in, there was an all out bus strike and it's hard to organise transport into the city.  I do hope to get it done soon though.  

Last year I was at the doctor for another issue and some blood was taken for testing. There was no hiv testing with this.  I was tested for thyroid, diabetes, and something else, I forget.  My blood work all came back clear except for a slightly raised RBC (red blood cell count) and lower MCV (whatever that is) and my doctor recommended iron.  

Would a routine blood test show a battle against an infection of some sort if I was infected with HIV? I suppose some areas in blood work results that may be cause to investigate further.  I suppose what I need right now is a little bit of peace of mind until I organise an sti test and for results to come back.  

I'm female.  Sexual partners has been very limited to date, thank goodness.  There has been no one since 2011.  Healthwise I'm doing good.  "

Last night i gave a rim job to a sex worker very briefly and received oral sex with no condom. I had the flu about a week and a half ago and had a canker sore. the canker sore has mostly healed, in fact it doesn't hurt at all. However it is still there. I did not see any blood on her anus and i only took one lick and stuck my tongue into the entrance for just a second. Could the canker sore be considered an open wound and i get hiv from licking the anus? Here are some more facts that may be important. 

1) She claims she was clean and tested.

2) The canker sore is at the back of my mouth near the wisdom tooth.

3) I saw no blood but i read that rectal fluid can also have hiv. I don't know what rectal fluid looks like but i don't remember seeing any fluid and her hole was very clean. No blood or scratches but i did stick my tongue in very briefly into the the entrance and i don't know what was there. 

4) I also received oral sex without a condom. I had no scratches and i asked to see the inside of her mouth and didn't see any wounds.

5) My lips were quite chapped due to the weather and i was peeling skin off earlier in the day. Can this be considered an open wound while rimming?

Please forgive me if my questions are ridiculous but please be honest with me, am i at risk for hiv? thanks in advance for your time."

Hoping some of you would be able to give me better info.

I want to know if someone has been tested HIV negative using a ECLIA / ELISA Antibody test, what is the risk of infection during unprotected sex because of the window period? So that means someone can be infected and still transmit the virus, even when the test comes back negative?

What would be the best diagnostic tests on the market that could be used to reduce risks drastically for bareback sex, or just need to wait 3-6 months and use condoms until a 2nd test? 

Thank you in advance!"

I've been having unprotected sex with a girlfriend for the past 6 months. We were both virgins when we started having sex, but she had performed oral sex on two other guys. About two months ago, I developed oral thrush in my mouth. My doctor suspected it could be STD related, but I lied regarding my sexual activity since a parent was in the room. I didn't think too much of it. About two weeks ago I began have random muscle strains and aches across the left side of my back and shoulder. Then this week, I've had a rash explode specifically only on my feet and hands, which continues to get more dense and spread across the specific parts. Nothing in my lifestyle changed (soaps or anything like that) and I do not have any allergies. My doctor was very confused but believed it could be allergenic. HIV Rash is often confused with that of an allergenic rash. After doing a lot of research, it seems quite likely that I will test HIV positive.

On the other hand, I had a few questions about living with HIV.

With insurance, what is an approximate monthly cost for HIV medication?


If I have a vacation within two weeks, and I test positive next week, should I cancel my vacation in order to begin my HIV baseline evaluation and medication testing?

Are side effects of HIV medication significant?

6d0lar,Possible exposure to hiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/hivaids/comments/6d0lar/possible_exposure_to_hiv/,otrhrowbawan,0,2017-05-24 00:10:55,5,/r/hivaids/comments/6d0lar/possible_exposure_to_hiv/,NaN,"I got drunk about 2 weeks ago, and had unprotected oral sex with a girl for about 5 minutes. We went to have unprotected vaginal sex, but I stopped it. I was inside of her for all of about 10 seconds. I stopped the vaginal intercourse at that point, and that was the end of the interaction. I have since heard from people that she has a history of a lot of partners. I am usually safe, but this was just one of two slip ups in my lifetime, because I was drunk. STDs really scare me. I tend to get this anxious and nervous after any unprotected sex activity, unless I really trust the person. 

Since then, i have been having a number of symptoms that look like some kind of std. I thought I had the clap at one point because my testicle felt sore. I had a rash on my penis, and thought I had herpes. I went to planned parenthood today, and they gave me a rapid test to check for HIV in my past experiences, but I know it is way to early for me to trust and I wasn't really worried too much about HIV until the day before. I had a cold sore break out the day before, right at the two week mark. Now I am having constipation, muscle and joint aches, weird sensation in the throat, gastrointestinal issues (stomach gurling and a little pain). And of course the rash and stuff I mentioned earlier. No fever yet.

For the past week I have been driving myself mad googling all sorts of stds, and thinking I had them, but this one is really worrying me. The rash on my penis was examined by the doctor, and she said it was just thrush, which I read could also be a symptom. I have been feeling sicker these past couple of days, but I cant tell if that my body seriously trying to tell me something, or my stress triggering symptoms that make me think I have it. What do you guys think? Is there cause for concern here? Could the yeast infection be causing these symptoms? Or is it itself a symptom of seroconversion?

I know it is two early for a reliable test, and i have to wait about another month, but this is seriously affecting my life, both a work and with friends and family. Everyone can tell I am stressed and depressed, but when I they ask whats wrong, I don't have the heart to tell them what I think it might be. 

Should I go in for RNA testing? I read that can be detected in less than 2 weeks. How reliable are those? Any other suggestions?

Sorry for the long post. I tend to ramble when I'm stressed, and I have no one to talk to about this. "

Normally I wouldn't give this a second thought as I'm educated and I know that HIV cannot be spread by casual contact.

However, a memory from six months ago came to mind. During our trip to India, when my daughter was a year old, we visited an orphanage for children with HIV and AIDS. There were about 40 children. My daughter played with them and she shared some snacks with them. At this stage, she was also teething and mouthing (putting objects in her mouth). 

She picked up a cold from one of the children which lasted a month, but after that she was fine. Also, she hasn't gained any weight in six months (literally only 500 grams) but this could be due to her being more active as a toddler.

I went to visit my doctor who wants me to do a blood test. He did say that the possibility was remote. 

Should I put my daughter through the agony of a blood test? Two people will need to hold her arm down while they try to find the vein and poke around to draw blood. It would be traumatizing for her.

Is the blood test worth the trauma? Is there a real risk she could have HIV?"

There are also other factors that may lead to a false positive but he claims that an autoimmune disorder is the most common cause.



This would kind of make sense since an autoimmune disorder causes a persons immunity to fire up and ""overwork"" producing all kinds of antibodies. The professor claims that this can cause an antibody HIV test to pick up a false positive result.




He mentioned such autoimmune disorders as Lupus or even Psoriasis. I know that psoriasis is a common symptom of HIV which confuses me even more.


Here's a quote on Psoriasis from wikipedia: 
&gt; Epidermal skin tissue affected by psoriatic inflammation often has many CD8+ T cells while a predominance of CD4+ T cells makes up the inflammatory infiltrates of the dermal layer of skin and the joints


This would explain the CD4 pickup in the HIV testing.


He is probably more educated than most of us, I'm just wondering if anyone has had or have read about autoimmune disorders interfering with the HIV antibody testing."

The epidemic was caused by the “introduction” of a new retrovirus (the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV for short); and the introduction of a new herpes-8 virus, the virus that causes Kaposi’s sarcoma, widely known as the “gay cancer” of AIDS. The taboo theory that AIDS is a man-made disease is largely based on research showing an intimate connection between government vaccine experiments and the outbreak of “the gay plague”
The widely accepted theory is that HIV/AIDS originated in a monkey or chimpanzee virus that “jumped species” in Africa. However, it is clear that the first AIDS cases were recorded in gay men in Manhattan in 1979, a few years before the epidemic was first noticed in Africa in 1982. It is now claimed that the human herpes-8 virus (also called the KS virus), discovered in 1994, also originated when a primate herpes virus jumped species in Africa. How two African species-jumping viruses ended up exclusively in gay men in Manhattan beginning in the late 1970s has never been satisfactorily explained.

Researchers who claim AIDS is a man-made disease believe it is much more likely that these two primate viruses were introduced and spread during the government’s recruitment of thousands of male homosexuals beginning in 1974.
Large numbers of gay men in Manhattan donated blood for the experimental hepatitis B vaccine trial, which took place at the New York Blood Center in Manhattan in 1978. Extensive evidence supporting the man-made theory of AIDS is easily found on the Internet by Googling: man-made origin of AIDS; and in my two books, “AIDS and the Doctors of Death” and “Queer Blood: The Secret AIDS Genocide Plot.”
Government interest in “gay health” before the AIDS epidemic
Beginning in the mid-1970s, government scientists became interested in the health of gay men, particularly in the realm of sexually-transmitted diseases, and specifically in the sexual transmission of the hepatitis B virus. The early 1970s was a time when large numbers of gays come out of the closet and identified themselves as homosexuals at government-sponsored health clinics. Organizations such as the Gay Men’s Health Project were formed at this time. Promiscuous gays were avidly sought as volunteers to test the efficacy of a newly-developed hepatitis B vaccine manufactured by Merck and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
By 1977 over 13,000 Manhattan gays were screened to secure the final 1083 men who would serve as guinea pigs to test the hepatitis B vaccine. The vaccine was manufactured from the combined plasma of 30 highly selected gay men who carried the hepatitis B virus in their blood. Developed over a period of 65 weeks during 1977-1978 and tested for six months in chimpanzees (the primate in which HIV is thought to have originated), the first group of gay men were inoculated at the New York Blood Center in November 1978.
That same year a final cohort of 6875 homosexual men at the San Francisco City Clinic was assembled to study hepatitis B virus sexual transmission in that city. By the end of the decade gays in clinics in Los Angeles, Denver, Chicago, and St. Louis, also came under surveillance by the Centers for Disease Control. An additional 1402 volunteers were finally selected to participate in similar vaccine experiments in those cities beginning in March 1980.
Before 1978 there was no stored blood anywhere in the U.S. that tested positive for HIV or the KS virus. There were no cases of AIDS and no cases of “gay cancer” in young men.
The first cases of AIDS appeared shortly after the experiment began in Manhattan. In June 1981 the epidemic became official and was quickly labelled the “gay ­related immune deficiency syndrome”, later known as AIDS.
The gay community was the most hated minority in America. After the experiments ended, the gay community was decimated by the “gay plague.” In the first years of AIDS, the epidemic was largely ignored by the government (see Randy Shilt’s best-seller, And the Band Played On) and the disease was blamed on gay anal sex, drugs, and promiscuity. Gays were immediately labelled “high risk.”
In my view, what made gay men “high risk” was the fact that they were the exclusive volunteers for government medical experiments that undoubtedly put them at “high risk.” The evidence for this conclusion is outlined in this report. Further evidence can be obtained from abstracts of scientific reports available on the Internet at the PubMed website of the National Library of Medicine.
The gay hepatitis B experiments (1978-1981)
The experimental hepatitis B vaccine injected into gays was unlike any other vaccine previously made. As stated, it was developed in chimpanzees and manufactured in a year-long process of sterilization and purification of the pooled blood of 30 gay men who were hepatitis B virus carriers.
The final group of 1083 selected for the first experiment at the Blood Center were inoculated from November 1978 until October 1979. At one point, there was great concern that the vaccine might be contaminated. According to June Goodfield’s Quest for the Killers, p 86, “This was no theoretical fear, contamination having been suspected in one batch made by the National Institutes of Health, though never in Merck’s.” Each gay man was given three inoculations of the vaccine over a period of three months. The vaccine proved successful with 96% of the men developing protective antibodies against the hepatitis B virus.
It has been assumed by some that these men might have been already immunosuppressed due to promiscuity and venereal disease. Although the young men in the study were indeed “promiscuous” (this was a requirement for entrance into the study), they were in excellent health. Despite many previous sexual partners, these volunteers had never been infected with the hepatitis B virus, which was a requirement for participation in the experiment. Furthermore, the 96% success rate would not have been accomplished if the men were immunosuppressed, because such people often do not respond to the vaccine.
When Robert Gallo’s blood test for HIV became available in the mid-1980s, the New York Blood Center’s stored gay blood specimens were re-examined. Most astonishing is the fact that 20% of the gay men who volunteered for the hepatitis B experiment in Manhattan were discovered to be HIV-positive in 1980 (one year before the AIDS epidemic became “official” in 1981). This signifies that Manhattan gays in 1980 had the highest incidence of HIV anywhere in the world, including Africa, the supposed birthplace of HIV and AIDS. In addition, we now know that one out of five gay men (20%) tested positive for the new KS herpes-8 virus in 1982 when stored blood samples from an AIDS trial in New York City were re-examined by epidemiologists at the NCI in 1999.
Never mentioned by AIDS historians is the fact that the New York Blood Center established a chimp virus laboratory for viral vaccine research in West Africa in 1974. One of the purposes of VILAB II, in Robertsfield, Liberia, was to develop the hepatitis B vaccine in chimps. The lab also prides itself by releasing “rehabilitated” (but virus-infected) chimps back into the wild, perhaps accounting for some of the ancestors of HIV and the KS virus found in the jungle by some government researchers. The Virus Cancer Program and the birth of AIDS,
In the decade before AIDS the Virus Cancer Program (1968-1980), sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, attempted to prove that viruses caused human cancer. Ultimately the Program was unsuccessful in providing proof, yet it succeeded in building up the field of animal retrovirology, which led to a more complete understanding of how cancer-causing and immunosuppressive viruses in animals might cause disease in humans. The VCP was also the birthplace of genetic engineering, molecular biology, and the human genome project. As the VCP was winding down in the late 1970s, the gay experiments began in New York City.
The introduction of HIV and the KS herpes virus into gay men during this period (along with some “novel” and now-patented mycoplasmas discovered at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology) miraculously revived the career of Robert Gallo and made him the most famous virologist in the world. And, of course, turned the “failure” of the VCP into a triumph by providing proof that these primate-derived viruses could cause disease in humans.
	

	
The fear of the hepatitis B vaccine
When AIDS began there were scattered reports in the medical journals questioning whether the “gay plague” might have its origin in the hepatitis B experiments. It was well-known in medical circles that the vaccine was made from the pooled plasma of gay men – and there was fear that the AIDS agent might be in the vaccine. As a result, when the hepatitis B commercial vaccine became available in July 1982, many people refused to be injected with it.
The fear of the vaccine was readily admitted by the CDC. Nevertheless, in detailed reports the CDC concluded that the vaccine was safe. Although it was clear the hepatitis B vaccine eliminated all “known” viruses, this obviously did not apply to “unknown” viruses at the time, such as HIV and the KS virus.
After HIV was discovered in 1984 some of the vaccine was retested and declared free of HIV. Of course, it was impossible to say whether the vaccine contained the KS virus, because this virus was undiscovered until 1994. I am unaware of any subsequent testing of the vaccine for this herpes KS virus.
Possible contamination problems with the hepatitis vaccine was the impetus that led Luc Montagnier to hunt for a virus in the new gay disease in the autumn of 1982. He began testing batches of human plasma for “reverse transcriptase activity”, a biochemical sign indicating the possible presence of a retrovirus. (See page 46 of his book “Virus”). Montagnier’s research eventually led to the first discovery of the AIDS virus at the Pasteur Institute in Paris.
Although the CDC and the New York Blood Center claimed it was safe, many health professionals refused the hepatitis B vaccine. In 1985, only 23 out of 162 Rhode Island dentists agreed to take the vaccine because of concerns about AIDS. As late as 1990, 13 out of 14 black nurses at a university hospital refused to take the vaccine for the same reason.
The fate of the gay men in the gay experiments
The purpose of the gay experiments was to test a vaccine that could immunize people against hepatitis B virus. Infection with this virus could lead to severe liver disease and sometimes to liver cancer. Ironically, an unprecedented explosion of cancer took place in male homosexuals after the experiment. Reports of the fate of these men attest to the fact that participating in the government’s experiments was clearly injurious to the health of gay men.
Significantly, there were no reported blood specimens anywhere in the U.S. that were HIV-positive prior to the epidemic in 1979, except in the samples stored at the NYBC.
In a May 12, 1983, letter to the editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, Cladd Stevens (who supervised the NYBC experiment) wrote : “No cases haves occurred in the vaccine recipients from populations at low risk of AIDS, and there is no excess incidence in the high-risk population.” But this proved to be incorrect in later reports co-authored by Stevens.
In a 1985 report Cladd Stevens et al. claimed that seven men (out of 1083) were HIV-positive before they received either vaccine or placebo. If true, this indicates that HIV (and possibly the KS virus) was already present in the blood of Manhattan homosexuals and could have contaminated the pooled blood of gays whose plasma was used to make the vaccine in 1977.
As stated previously, a 1986 report in JAMA showed 20% of the men in the experiment were already infected with HIV by the end of 1981; and by 1984, more than 40% of the men were HIV-positive and doomed to death.
Another follow-up study of 8,906 gay men who donated blood for the hepatitis experiments in Manhattan was released in 1992. Statistical analysis of this group showed that mortality rates for men aged 25-44 began to rise in the 1980s, with AIDS the leading cause of death among young men in New York City. Remarkably, “The all-cause mortality in this cohort in 1988 was 24 times higher that the mortality rate in the cohort before the beginning of the AIDS epidemic.”
Was the hepatitis B vaccine contaminated with HIV and the KS virus?
Largely forgotten in AIDS history is the hepatitis B vaccine trial that also took place with 685 gay Dutch volunteers in Amsterdam between November 1980 and December 1981. Unlike the American vaccine makers, the Dutch researchers heated their experimental hepatitis B vaccine for added safety.
A 1986 report of the trial clearly states the AIDS virus “was not transmitted by the heat inactivated hepatitis B vaccine.” Of the 685 participants, five were already infected with HIV when the trial began. The researchers theorized that HIV entered the Dutch gay population at the end of the 1970s.
Another follow-up Dutch report of this trial in 1993 again suggests the efficacy of heating the vaccine for safety. (The experimental vaccine was not heated in the U.S. until after all the gay experiments were completed.) At the end of 1982, one year after the Dutch experiment had ended, only As stated previously, a 1986 report in JAMA showed 20% of the men in the experiment were already infected with HIV by the end of 1981; and by 1984, more than 40% of the men were HIV-positive and doomed to death.
7.5% of the Amsterdam men were infected. In contrast, 26.8% of the men in the New York experiment were HIV-positive; and a whopping 42.6% of the San Francisco men were HIV-positive. These statistics showing many men infected in the American trials in 1982 further prove that Cladd Stevens of the NYBC, and the CDC, were incorrect in declaring there was no excess incidence of AIDS in the “high-risk” gay male population.
The fate of all the men who participated in the hepatitis B vaccine trials in six U.S cities has never been revealed. However, it is likely from the statistics presented in JAMA in 1986 that many, if not most, of the men eventually died of AIDS. The actual number of AIDS deaths has never been revealed, nor have the individual medical records been studied. Attempts to secure this information have been rebuffed by the Blood Center, due to the “confidential” nature of the experiment.
“Gay Cancer” and the origin of AIDS
After the introduction of HIV and the KS virus into the U.S. gay male population in the late 1970s, the incidence of KS skyrocketed.
A 1989 report by Biggar found no cases of KS in young men in New York City during the years 1973-1976. But by 1985 the incidence of KS in “never-married men” in Manhattan had increased 1850 times. In San Francisco the rate of KS increased over 2000 times!
KS is now 20,000 times more common in AIDS patients than in the general population. A 1985 autopsy study by Lee Moskowitz of 52 AIDS cases (23 Haitians, 19 gays, 5 intravenous drug abusers, 2 hemophiliacs, and 3 persons at unknown risk) showed that 94% of AIDS patients from the various risk groups had internal KS. The CDC claims KS now occurs in only 15% of gay men (down from 30% at the beginning of the epidemic), but these statistics are not based on current autopsy studies
KS was never a sexually-transmitted disease before the introduction of HIV into gays. For a century after the first reported KS cases were discovered in Vienna in 1872, there was no evidence that KS could be transmitted from person-to-person.
By 1950, a more aggressive “endemic” form of KS was uncovered in African blacks. Still, there was no evidence the disease was transmissible or contagious. Suddenly with the introduction of HIV into the homosexual community, scientists began to view KS as a contagious “gay cancer” out of Africa.
The new KS virus is closely related to a monkey tumour virus, known as herpes virus saimiri, that was extensively studied by researchers in the VCP in the decade before the epidemic. Initially found only in KS from AIDS patients, the new KS virus has also been found in non-AIDS-related KS tumours and in other forms of cancer, such as lymphoma and multiple myeloma.
HIV is a cancer-causing virus. Infection with HIV (with or without the KS virus) has resulted in a noticeable increase in various forms of cancer. A 2005 study of over 4000 AIDS patients showed higher rates of melanoma, basal and squamous cell skin carcinomas, anal carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, and Hodgkin disease, when compared with age-adjusted rates for the general United States population.
The KS virus is now in the U.S. blood supply; and blood is not screened routinely for this virus. A 2001 study indicated that 15% of normal Texas blood donors showed evidence of KS virus infection in the blood. A 2002 study of healthy children (ages 4-13) in South Texas showed that 26% had antibodies to the KS virus in their blood.
Is AIDS a man-made disease?
How did these two viruses of primate origin get into the gay male population to cause AIDS and a contagious form of cancer? AIDS experts blame monkeys and chimps in the African jungle. My research indicates it is much more likely these viruses were introduced during government-sponsored hepatitis B experiments using gays as unsuspecting guinea pigs. Extensive documentation of past “secret medical experiments” by the government can be found on Google. A recent BBC news report (30 Nov 2004) uncovering unauthorized and dangerous HIV drug experiments on infants and children in New York City orphanages can be found by “Googling“: BBC + guinea pig kids.
Until proven otherwise, a “new” HIV retrovirus and a “new” KS virus could easily have been developed in a laboratory as part of the Virus Cancer Program. In the decade before AIDS it was common to transfer and adapt primate retroviruses and herpes viruses into human cells in genetic engineering experiments. Such viruses were deemed potential “candidate human viruses,” as clearly stated in the annual progress reports of the VCP. For further details on the relationship of the VCP to the introduction of HIV, Google: virus cancer program + AIDS.
The connection between the hepatitis experiments and the AIDS epidemic was quickly dismissed by government authorities two decades ago. However, it is clear from a review of the scientific literature that the “gay plague” began immediately after the government experiments; and the experiments permanently damaged the health of the gay community, and led to continuing spread of HIV into the “general population.”
Are we to believe that all this is merely a coincidence -and that AIDS in America resulted simply from two viruses jumping species in the African jungle? Or is the origin of HIV and AIDS -and the KS virus- related to secret medical research and covert human testing, as suggested here.

6m7v97,Possible hiv encounter,https://www.reddit.com/r/hivaids/comments/6m7v97/possible_hiv_encounter/,lelife,0,2017-07-09 08:01:02,7,/r/hivaids/comments/6m7v97/possible_hiv_encounter/,NaN,"I am a 22 year old female and I believe I may have acquired HIV after a sexual encounter without a condom last December (2016). It was a moment of pure ignorance and stupidity. I am completely disappointed in myself for having done this. At that time I was a virgin, and it hurt too much so the guy I was with didn't insert his penis all the way into my vagina. We stopped everything and therefore he did not cum in me. But I understand there are still risk factors because after all, there was contact. After the encounter only about 5 days later I developed flu like symptoms- night sweats, sore throat, fever and even a mildly swollen lymph node. So I immediately made an appt to get tested using a 4th generation exam. The results came back negative 3 weeks after the encounter. I still felt sick-ish for most of january and febrary. 3 months later in April I got re-tested and results came back negative again. However, I am currently on vacation in Italy and have been having flu like symptoms again and developed a rash on my left forearm and behind of my left thigh which lasted 2 weeks. The rash was a bit itchy and pink in color and appeared in small clusters. I am afraid I have HIV because I have had every symptom. I'm in Italy until the end of August I'm freaking out, and I can't change my flight date because I cannot afford the 850 euro fee. I spoke to a doctor casually about the rash but not about my hiv fear and she said it could be because of all the new food and fruit im eating or could be a heat rash. But idk if heat rashes last 2 weeks. I thought a 4th generation exam after 3 months would be conclusive but I am so scared about these symptoms. Is it usual to get retested again after 6 months? I don't know what to do. I am no longer with the guy, so i dont know how to mention this fear to him. Or how to suggest that he get tested without insulting him. Please help. Oh, and btw also I have not been with anyone in any way since the sexual encounter with my boyfriend (who claimed to be clean of any STDs) at the time in December. Any advice would be amazing. Thank you so much. "

6mr8h4,How did HIV affect your appearance?,https://www.reddit.com/r/hivaids/comments/6mr8h4/how_did_hiv_affect_your_appearance/,30585214449702571155,9,2017-07-11 20:00:47,1,/r/hivaids/comments/6mr8h4/how_did_hiv_affect_your_appearance/,NaN,"Recently found out I'm positive and feeling depressed. 

Prior to being diagnosed (two weeks ago), I had noticed my physical appearance changing a bit over the last few months, making me look more 'sickly'. This included a more gaunt look in my face (slightly more hollow cheeks and eyes) and what I percieve as a more yellowish skin tone. Coworkers have been asking if I'm sleeping alright/am sick. Oddly, I didn't really have any seroconversion symptoms that I can recall. Not sure when I actually first contracted the virus, but it was most likely 1+ year ago. 

What's bumming me out is that I haven't seen these effects in others that I know who are HIV+. I'm otherwise quite healthy, eat well, workout several times a week and wear sunscreen daily. I've always considered myself attractive so this change in appearance is really beating at my psyche and self esteem (on top of the depression I've experienced with my diagnosis).

Just curious if anyone else here noticed a physical change once they became HIV+. Did your appearance improve once you started meds? Interested in any changes that took place once meds were started or any anecdotes to make me feel less alone in this.

Thanks guys...glad to have this sub to help stay positive (lol) during this time:)"

Also might help some people I frequently see here asking if they might be positive. Sorry for formatting in advance but I don't use Reddit a lot.




I'm a straight male who enjoys partying and have done my share of unprotected sex.
I accidentally stuck myself with a needle while giving anesthesia to a patient (studying dentistry) and the protocols required me to take all the necessary viral testing, including HIV. (So called exposure protocol)


I didn't think anything extraordinary would come up, but the next day I get a call from the Doc that He wanted to speak face to face. So I immediately jump in a taxi and rush to his clinic. He gives me the news that the ELSA (initial HIV test) was positive and that I need to get a confirmatory test. I knew already then that HIV is a condition you can live a normal life with nowadays if treated correctly, nevertheless anxiety skyrocketed to say the least. I was told not to over stress it and that the results of the second test would take 10-14 days. Obviously those where some of my worst days ever awaiting results.



Cutting to the chase... I get a phone call two weeks later that my result was a false positive due to my Psoriasis which is an autoimmune disease which sometimes can cause false positive HIV Elsa results. 




The doc also mentioned that things like anxiety, any viral infection, bacterial infections, inflammations could trigger a false positive result.




So I guess what I'd like to say is not to worry before you get a positive result from a confirmatory Western Blot test, and even if it is positive, HIV is a very manageable virus nowadays. Like many in this subreddit say - it's no longer a death sentence like it used to be considered by some, back in the day. Also...wrap up guys..."

About a week ago I got drunk with a friend in Bangkok. We ended up taking back to my hotel 2 ladyboys. We started fooling around and during that they gave us head, rinming and also put condoms on us with lub. After this my ladyboy got up and rode my penis in a squat position. During insertion I heard a disconcerting popping sound. Worried about the condom I stopped our contact after 1-2 minutes. I went to the bathroom and inspected the condom. There was quite a lot of blood and lub on the tip. I felt the condom from shaft to tip - it felt intact. I then removed the condom and inspected my still erect penis, it appeared clean with no blood on it. I then had a shower and washed thoroughly with soap. Sexual contact was over after that - I also asked the ladyboy their HIV status, they said negative, they looked shocked and added they were only 19. My question was that popping sound the condom breaking? Or a normal sound from anal insertion? I'm a hetro male so not used to any of this! What is my HIV risk from all this? Thanks to all who answer. "

I have been lately visiting escorts, I always have had vaginal sex with them with protection but also sometimes I have had oral sex from me to them without it and also vice versa.

Last two relationships were three weeks ago and a week ago, last Wednesday. This last Friday I developed bacterial pharyngitis with a fever that lasted two days more or less. I am a lot better but I continue taking oral antibiotics, the treatment that my doctor prescribed me was for 8 days.

Today my inner arm started itching, and when I realized I had a rash with red dots and the skin that surrounded them was also irritated. I stopped scratching it and now it looks better with a pinkish color.

I am really worried about these symptoms being an acute HIV infection. The last time I had an HIV test was a few months ago because I am a blood donor.

Thanks."

My wife has a rare cancer and she has reduced the cancer dramatically with diet which helped strengthen the immune system to manage cancer cells. Basically by eliminating inflammation foods and taking more than 45 different vitamins (as well as superfood green drinks, etc.). In addition she is on a ketogenic diet.

We are curious if any of the 40+ HIV/AIDS immune system drugs are beneficial for someone with cancer? I wonder if any of the medications affect cell regeneration by boosting the immune system in such a way that allows the cells to more easily heal/repair.

Almost two weeks ago, a guy and I performed oral sex on each other. It was a drunken night and that is all that we did. Neither one of us came (I was too drunk to continue, or so I said), and from what I can recall, I do not even remember tasting precum. 

I received a message that he just recently found out that he his HIV+ and that I should get myself tested.

From what the internet tells me (not a good resource, I know), viral load is very high when someone is initially infected with HIV. This increases the risk of catching the virus. 

I know that oral sex is a very low-risk form of transmission - sometimes even impossible given the ""proper"" circumstances. But with these facts in mind:

-No ejaculation entered my mouth (from what I am remembering, this involves precum as well)
-He was recently infected (high viral load?)
-No cuts of any kind were in my mouth (or his, I hope)
-We did make out for a bit
-And (not sure how relevant this is, but might as well put it all out there) we were smoking cigs and drinking a considerable amount, as well as doing poppers

1 week after , i took the finger prick test it said negative, but i know thats only good for 3 months ago..

i have asked her for sure if she is negative 3-4 seperate times she has told me yes but to stop talking to her because im asking too much.

what is the risk in getting HIV from a neo vagina compared to anal or vaginal sex? i am not circumsized and i did not cum in her. we had sex for 10-15 minutes. i have heard it is 1/131 chance of getting it. this is very high risk in my opinion :(

My name's Claire, I am a producer for a media company based in Brooklyn, NY. We have an upcoming week of STD awareness programming, and we're looking to produce a piece about HIV+ individuals and their dating lives. The aim is to promote awareness and to decrease stigma around HIV contraction.

I've had a look at this subreddit, and there's a lot of great dialogue around this topic. I wonder if you can suggest anyone who would be happy to talk to us on camera about their experience.

Any assistance you could provide would be so appreciated. You can reach me at claireingebretsen4@gmail.com, and I'm happy to provide further details.
I look forward to hearing from you, and thank you so much in advance.

I asked what it was for but they didn’t give me a clear answer well I was like “alright” and scheduled it for 2:00 PM that next Monday.

I shake her hand and she brings me into an office I’ve never seen in the building. We sit down and she says “ your test results came back and your HIV test was Reactive . “ my soul sank and I don’t think my mind was letting me believe what she had just said. We talked for a bit longer but nothing I can remember from the shock, she told me to call her whenever night or day to ask questions. She left but before she left she told me another woman would be right it. As soon as the door closed I started balling I install called my partner to tell him, he told me everything was going to be fine and kept a good attitude. I had to tel him I’d call him back because the next woman walked in.  We sat and talked and she told me about where I would need to go and the next phase in the process. I soon left after getting her card. I started walking home to which ic allied my partner again and he kept a positive attitude and did his best to keep me calm. The thing is I was not worried about myself I was worried about him, the past Friday night we had unprotected sex again. ( stupid I know )
I reminded my partner about them and he said if he has it he has it but I f he don’t he don’t and he’s praying he does not. He told me that he’s here for me and he never regretted being with me or meeting me. I think I know I got it.

74ufay,HIV Medication Availability Abroad--A Genuine Questions--for once.,https://www.reddit.com/r/hivaids/comments/74ufay/hiv_medication_availability_abroada_genuine/,genquestion123,5,2017-10-07 04:49:52,0,/r/hivaids/comments/74ufay/hiv_medication_availability_abroada_genuine/,NaN,"Hi. I've read the freak out posts and all that, but I legitimately have a question that I hope someone can answer, or at least point me in the right direction.

Basics:
- I live in the US, positive, in treatment and undetectable for over 5 years.
- My husband lives in Colombia, and is also positive, but contracted it from a previous relationship some years ago (~4).
- Medical care there, although free, is not easy to come by (long lines, no call backs, etc.).

I was was wondering if anyone knows of any facilities or centers there, or even the names of medication available there that he can take. 

(We have been together 4 years; he will be here in about 6 months, once the visas go through, etc. He went to a doctor, they confirmed it, then never called him back.)

Since I am not there to help, or drag him somewhere, I am reaching out to ask if anyone has knowledge or experience with this. He lives in Cali, Colombia. I have found a couple of centers, but they are not compatible with his government issues insurance. 



I ask, sincerely because I love him and care for him, if anyone can help. Yes, he will be here soon, but I know the importance of starting treatment early, as I did. 

Their pharmacies are more generous than ours, so if I can get a generic brand name to pass on to him, all the better. Just looking for guidance.

Thank you in advance!

Edit: I have done extensive internet research. Perhaps I missed something, but still thought I would ask."
750osp,Probably hiv?,https://www.reddit.com/r/hivaids/comments/750osp/probably_hiv/,HIdemeinyourVeil,1,2017-10-08 01:54:47,5,/r/hivaids/comments/750osp/probably_hiv/,NaN,"Hi! I created an anonymous account since I don’t want anyone what I write here. Anyway, here goes.

I had a high fever for about 3 days. From 39 degrees Celsius to 40. Accompanied by rashes, headache and joint pains.

At first they thought it was dengue, however tests shows that it isn’t so they concluded that it must be german measles. After treatment the fever was gone and so are the rashes. And I finally got discharged of the hospital.

The next day when I woke up, I found my body with a lot of rashes again. But no fever. I’m looking up symptoms and all I see are HIV related illness.

Moving forward, I’m afraid that maybe this is symptoms of HIV. Also, I haven’t got tested but when I was confined they kept on testing my blood. So if it was HIV positive they would let me know right? It’s something that they could probably see that in their regular blood tests right?

I’m probably just panicking or whatever. But can anyone lend me a sound advice here? Thanks! 

Reason why I’m having doubts:
Had a protected anal sex with some guy (i was top)
He gave me head unprotected
This happened about a month ago.

And another encounter was an unprotected anal sex about 2-3 years ago again I was top. And caught syphillis and gonorrhea from it. It got treated of course however I never really tested if I might be hiv +"

He seems like a great guy so far though and I want to get to know him more. He's already said I love you which was very fast, but when I said I like him but don't love him he took it really well and said he just wanted me to know how he felt. 

He stayed over at my place last night for the first time, and I noticed he had a pill bottle sitting in the top of his partially opened bag. I got curious and turned it to see the label better. I googled the name of it, and it turns out it's for HIV. 

I'm wondering whether I should bring it up with him, or whether I should wait for him to bring it up with me? Ive done research on HIV before and I know it's difficult to transmit and it's usually well controlled by medication. I guess I just want him to know I'm not going to drop him like a hot potato if I know, but I also don't want to force it out of him before he's ready to disclose. 

By the way - just in case anyone asks - we haven't progressed beyond kissing and handsy-type stuff, so the chances of me being infected by our activities in that department are virtually zero.

The only 'condomless' sex was performing oral sex with them. 
I didn't had diarrhea, fever and the other 'classic symptoms'.

Maybe I'm just freaking out?

7cewqd,Does HIV mean wearing condoms for sex for the rest of life? How sure is undetectable?,https://www.reddit.com/r/hivaids/comments/7cewqd/does_hiv_mean_wearing_condoms_for_sex_for_the/,scharingizcaring,4,2017-11-12 03:22:52,13,/r/hivaids/comments/7cewqd/does_hiv_mean_wearing_condoms_for_sex_for_the/,NaN,"Hiv negative couples often get in a relationship, get tested together, get on prep, and stop condom use. Can serodiscordant couples do this? 

Ive read the partner study, and while zero transmissions is good news, the study participants were sometimes using condoms: among 888 couples, 
""35 condomless sex acts a year and half of gay couples reported having more than 42""

Nontheless, the total condomless sex acts were
""approximately 22,000 among gay couples and 36,000 among heterosexual couples ""

Did these partners pull out before ejaculation? Did they employ strategic positioning? Are these acts including oral? 

http://www.catie.ca/en/catienews/2016-09-06/negligible-risk-updated-results-two-studies-continue-show-antiretroviral-treatm

I notice that there were hiv transmissions in the partner study, but the researchers thought the virus came from outside the relationship, because the virus didn't match genetically. 11 transmissions... Can we really be sure that just because they don't match genetically that they aren't from the main partner?

Also, in the HTTPN study there were 78 infections: 26 from outside partners, 38 from partners not taking their meds, 4 from virological failure, and 4 from partners who had just started ART less than 3 months before transmission.

I can't help it but I'm very skeptical. There are still so many unknown possibilities.

The partners enrolled had been having sex before the studies began, so perhaps the negative partner had been exposed to but resisted infection, gaining some resistance to their partners virus. Is this possible?

Also, is it more dangerous to start having sex 6 months after starting ART, recently becoming undetectable. ? Some of these positive partners in the study had been undetectable for years, even a decade. 

The risk would also increase over years of being in a relationship no? And with more condomless sex acts per year. 42 times per year isn't much! Try once or twice a day! That would be 365 to 712 times per year. And then if your doing that for years then isn't the risk magnified? 

So, does this mean that a condomless sex life for years and years between a sexually active young gay couple is elusive if one partner is positive? Prep could help, but it isn't 100% either. 

How do serodiscordant couples navigate this? I've heard from many of my friends in serodiscordant couples, that condom use is not always there. "

Last month, on my birthday, I decided to start a fundraiser (link above) to draw awareness to 2 causes near &amp; dear to my heart--when I was 19 years old, I was raped and infected with HIV.
 
I'm sharing my story because I'm tired. After living with this virus for 7 years, I am tired of the continued spread and FEAR, STIGMA and SHAME and not SCIENCE and FACTS. I refuse to allow hate to be continually projected towards my HIV positive community and I. 
 
Rather than tapping into negativity, I want to shift all that energy towards empowering my community--friends, family, coworkers, previous class mates and professors, with knowledge and science. 
 
I believe in my lifetime, we can see the first HIV/AIDS free generation--0 new infections. However, for this to be made a reality, we need there to be a healthy dialogue. Stigma instills fear and causes individuals to fear testing, making those whom are positive, out of care. We need for people to know their HIV status. Get tested! Those whom test positive, MUST have access to life saving treatment. For those at a high risk of contracting HIV, they MUST have access to PReP (a daily medicine which reduces the risk of contracting HIV that's 99% effective).

We spent the last 9 years living in US and from day one in US we joined the swinger lifestyle. By May 2014 we stopped because we had a bad encounter with dominant guy! My wife decided later she doesn't want to play with other but don't mind it if I play with her or took pics for her. 

We tested ourselves in May 2014 then again in September and it was all negative. 

Since then I played with couple of people

- single lady who is our friend and she just gave me one last bj by September 2014

- single lady we met her twice and I fucked her twice with condoms. She tested herself lately and told me she is negative. She wasn't into oral or kissing. 

- a couple who were our friends in swinger years. I met them in November 2016. I put the condom to start fucking her and she told she is on her period  I stopped and put my dick between her boobs until I came. After that her husband gave me bj to get it up again but I couldn't and stopped him after 1 minutes

- by January 2017 I met a lady in swinger club she was laying down I put the condom on fucked her until I came then left. 

- by end of januery I met a couple they have this fantasy of giving each other 69 the lady on top and I come in put the condom and start fucking her. I obliged and started to fuck her with condom while her husband kept licking my balls she stopped me because she doesn't feel okay about it.


After my last experience we decided to stop, then left US to get back to Saudi. Now my wife is a doctor and she told me that in all of these encounters we practiced safe sex and I shouldn't be worried about stds or hiv. I am little bit worried about it because i am applying for new job and they will have medical test and want my privacy. 

Should I be worried? During the entire time my wife and I are fucking without condoms.

After this questions he told me he was infected a year before we met(6 years). You can imagine how speechless I was. However, I still love him and want to be with him. Of course, the first thing I have done is to test my blood in a lab to check if I was HIV positive. The good thing is that it show a negative result which means I am clear of any type of HIV.

I'm from Europe and I'm an expat in the US. I was living somewhere in the east cost for a about a year, and now I'm on the west coast. I don't know anyone. Just a couple of people from work. But I can't really say I know them.

Basically on Monday I got tested for HIV, I get tested very often. About every three months. Last time I was tested was in August, maybe July. I never have unprotected sex, ever. I'm 29 years old now, it was my birthday a month ago. Today they told me over the phone I'm HIV positive. I thought they were joking, or it was a nightmare or something. Certainly a mistake. I don't know how I caught it. They said the test is really accurate and there's almost no room for mistake. They ran the tests multiple times. Tomorrow I'm seeing a  nurse (?) who specialises in HIV. He's from One Medical, I don't know why they are not sending me to a doctor. Anyway we'll see. 

I forgot to say that soon before I left to fly from Europe to California I met with a couple of guys, but always we used protection. Afterwards a few nights later, I started feeling a sore throat. I thought it was from oral, it wouldn't be the first time I felt like that after oral. Then I flew, for more than 10 hours. The jetlag, plane aircondition and all that worsened my throat. I went to see a doctor, she said it's nothing just a bit inflamed and gave me a syrup and such. Then I felt better after a few days. Then one day I was sitting in a caffee outside and started feeling cold. Went home and had fever. I was sick for about a week, the doctor gave me antibiotics. I wouldn't say I was really sick, but sick enough. I think that was the flu-like symptoms people were talking about after getting hiv. 

I am completely alone with 10 hours time difference to Europe. I don't know how to deal with this. I'm supposed to be going to work tomorrow, I'm supposed to be normal and everything. How the hell did I get it? I'm always careful. I'm annoyed at myself that I never took prep, so stupid of me. Now I'll leave the rest of my life with HIV, with a virus inside. 

It's over, I'm infected now. Alone and infected and nobody to give me a hug. "

I'm awful for spamming, however, I wouldn't be persistent if the work itself wasn't of the utmost consequence--especially given today being World AIDS Day 2017. 

I recently became vocal about my HIV status to my family and friends on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter in a bid to raise $7K for 2 causes near &amp; dear to my heart. Being vocal was never meant to be about me. I don't need pity. I became vocal because after 7 years of being positive, I realized I wasn't doing my part. On World AIDS Day 2017, I want to see 0 new infections. I want to see 0 AIDS-related deaths. I want to see an end to discrimination. Do you? 

If so, YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE, DONATE HERE (100% of proceeds go to Equality California, AIDS Project LA &amp; Rape Abuse National Network)--$5, $10, $20, $50, $100 plus--it all adds up and you can do it anonymously, if that's what you'd prefer:

 I have no insurance so I'm out $1300 usd. Luckily the pharmacist got me a coupon for truvada.

This is a study of 3 false negative cases, the 1st and 3rd are irrelevant(testing in the window period, non clade-B virus) but the 2nd case is interesting. It appears the guy was seropositive on a standard EIA, but when retested 5 years later he was negative. The case study attributes this to him lacking detectable gp41 antibody, but with all we know about HIV this seems highly unlikely. He was also weakly positive when retested again on another brand EIA, but him lacking detectable antibody means he was likely seronegative, yet not in full blown AIDS which is a hallmark of seronegative infection.

I'm now very much considering to get onto regular PrEP treatments to prevent any potential HIV infection, even though my (still somewhat limited) understanding is, that the side effects are not insignificant and it's generally said, that the HIV infection risk is relatively low for heterosexual sex partners.

A bit of background: I'm single, 100% hetero, live in Southern Africa and got a fairly high sex drive and try to get all regular sex partners and me tested, whenever a lady with a chance for repeat encounters comes along, but sometimes I do unsafe sex with someone who only verbally confirmed to be negative, sometimes that person can be a prostitute (from the higher end of the market) and I only ever did unprotected anal once. So generally my behavior can be described as relatively risky (I'm not a stranger to abortions), but at a supposed HIV infection risk of 0.04% is still very low.

Now I found out, that there's PrEP and it's fairly affordable (R500 a month, ca. 35 US$), but is known for some side effects and I wonder, whether it's advisable to go down that route and how serious the implications are.

I still don't understand how the high prevalence of HIV in Southern Africa can be explained, when it's mostly the homosexual audience that's at risk, but maybe I just miss some important figures and someone can shed some light?

P.S. if you haven't heard of PrEP, /r/PrEPfacts is recommending this Introduction to PrEP: http://whatisprep.org or Personal experiences: http://myprepexperience.blogspot.com/"

In the mean time, I’ve done some reading about HIV, and I’ve happy to go along with everything the way we usually do, for example he often gives me leftovers and I eat them, we used the same soap and shampoo in the shower, used the same toilet and cleaned it once a week unless there were obvious marks that needed cleaning, etc. I honestly don’t feel worried about it at all. 

However, he keeps bringing up the possibility of me being concerned. For example, when cooking he will say “don’t worry, I washed my hands and I didn’t lick the spoon.” He uses disposable gloves even when he’s just washed his hands when he cooks. He’s also gone out of his way to create separate shower racks for our soap and shampoo when before we used to just share the soap and shampoo. He’s started spraying the shower with disinfectant after each time he uses it and has started wiping the toilet seat with special wipes after he uses it. This has all happened since he told me. 

I feel awkward. I don’t know how to bring it up without making him feel weird and I’m scared of making the situation worse. I know that my chances of getting it are nil unless we have really close contact, for example unprotected sex, and then even then the rates of transmission would be low. 

Can anyone offer any advice? I really appreciate your time on this matter. "

I bought an at home HIV test off of Amazon the other day for under 40 dollars and took the test when I got home from work today:

As long as you are taking this test at around the 3 month mark after an exposure you are worried about and follow the directions exactly, the results are very accurate for this type of test.

If you are anxious about an experience, the best thing I can say is- Get tested! It doesn't matter how you get tested- if you go to see your physician, a clinic, etc. HIV is a fragile virus and one that isn't as easy as many initially believe in this sub to acquire. Taking a test can help ease your concerns about a situation and allow you to move on with your life. 

If I can take one- you can too :) 

Finally, I should mention that if you are sexually active, you should be getting tested every few months for a variety of STDs, not just HIV!

As always, if you are concerned about a situation or just want to talk- I am always here."

No Help for the Guy with HIV,https://www.reddit.com/r/hivaids/comments/7l3p1t/let_down_no_help_for_the_guy_with_hiv/,RojoGato6,2,2017-12-20 11:23:50,15,/r/hivaids/comments/7l3p1t/let_down_no_help_for_the_guy_with_hiv/,NaN,"One of the many things I learned about once I became HIV positive was CAREAssist, along with the Ryan White Act and AIDS Drug-Related Assistance Program or ADAP. CAREAssist being the program in Oregon that supports people living with HIV in affording their medication. The program will also cover insurance premiums and additional medical expenses. Considering that my doctor put me on a regimen of two pills daily, the total retail value being more than two thousand dollars a month, I was very grateful to have this assistance. 

Months went by, and I was largely silent about by status. Then one day while I was at work, I got a call from a manager of one of the clinics the agency I work for operates. She had received a check from CAREAssist, which listed me as the patient, and she wasn’t sure what to do with it or why I was listed as the patient. Since I worked in the billing department for our agency, I told her that I would come and collect the checks immediately and figure out what was going on. I promptly left work, drove to the clinic, pulled the interoffice mail waiting to go out, and grabbed the checks before anyone else could see them. Once I was in the safety of my car, I saw that they indeed were from CAREAssist, with my name listed, and they had been sent to the wrong address as reimbursement for my insurance premium. 

Panic. I was in panic. If this woman knew what CAREAssist was, then my status had just been disclosed to her. CAREAssist only serves one demographic, and it would just take a quick search online to figure that out. My status had just been indirectly disclosed to someone I work with. Regardless of my company having a policy against discrimination for HIV/AIDS status, I still didn’t want people to find out. I felt hurt, and violated. This was just another hurtful event in my journey since seroconverting and becoming HIV positive. 

I decided that I wanted to speak with a lawyer once I resolved who made the error. I wanted to know my rights. Had my status been disclosed, was there a real HIPAA violation, or was I making a mountain out of a mole hill? Then the question arose of who should I contact? I figured it only made sense to turn to an LGBTQ lawyer, so I did a quick search and found OGALLA (Oregon Gay and Lesbian Law Association). 

It became confusing, not knowing what type of law I was inquiring about. I found a lengthy list of ads, faces and names with brief blurbs. I picked a few that had kind faces in their pictures, or said something in their profile about HIV/AIDS, and I sent three emails and took two numbers. I left two voicemails. For a week, I waited for a response, and I received one email response telling me that the firm didn’t do the type of law I needed. No referral, no suggesting, just deflection. 

After this disappointing first attempt, I made more. I called the Oregon Bar Association and I got a referral for a lawyer. I had to leave a voicemail for this person as well, and never got a response. At some point, I reached out to the Lewis and Clark Law School for some direction, and they told me they don’t handle that type of law and suggested I contact the Bar Association. 

I then tried calling Cascade AIDS Project (CAP). The woman I spoke with referred me to Lewis and Clark and the Bar Association… At this point I was ready to cry. I had contacted at least seven lawyers at this point, and none of them had returned my inquiries beyond a simple statement of, “I don’t do that type of law”. I thought contacting an LGBTQ focused organization, an organization whose mission is to support people living with HIV/AIDS, could help me. Have some sort of direction or support or referral. Nothing. 

Every time I reached out to someone, I was giving my name and my HIV status. I was continuously putting myself in a vulnerable position, sharing my story, my health information, and asking for help. Time and time again I was let down, ignored, deflected. Despair began to set it; why wouldn’t anyone help me? Was I asking the impossible? I wasn’t even asking these lawyers to take a pro-bono case and sue the Oregon Health Authority, I just wanted to know what my rights were. Had a HIPAA violation actually occurred? Was I in allowed to be as angry and hurt as I was? That’s all I wanted to know, yet not one of them could take five minutes to validate my experience. To see me. 

Eventually I did get connected with a lawyer (a friend of a friend) who took my call, and was kind enough to give me half an hour of his time to chat and help me figure out where I stood legally and validate that yes, I had been wronged. Whether there was any legal action to take or not, I at least knew where I stood. It was so comforting to me just to have someone listen to my story, and offer a professional opinion and support. 

Since seroconverting (becoming HIV positive), I’ve felt invisible. I interact with people every day, but I feel like I’ve gone back in the closet. Once again, I am hiding something about myself. Why? Because I am terrified of how people will treat me if they know the truth. Would their opinion of me change if they knew I had HIV? Would I suddenly become a drug addict or slut in their eyes? 

I write this not to call out Oregon Health Authority or any other organization listed. I share my experience because I worry that it will be a shared experience. That others with HIV will be in need of legal counsel, of support, and won’t be able to access it. Why was my journey for support so difficult? I tried every avenue I could find, and met one dead-end after another. We may have come a long way in terms of healthcare and general societal stigma around HIV, but in this I was let down.

I'm male btw. These are some questions and the reasons I'm asking:

What did you do to acquire HIV?

I'm asking because I have had some risky activities and was wondering if I could have it. I had sex with a cuckold couple(2 1/2 months ago, received unprotected oral, and protected vaginal sex. I also had sex with two prostitutes. The first one gave oral sex with a condom and vaginal with a condom (6 weeks ago).The second one gave me unprotected oral and protected vaginal sex (3-4 weeks ago). The second one for some reason I had trouble staying hard, so could that effect the condoms effectiveness? I also fingered her during the blowjob and touched my penis afterwards, could hiv transfer that way? I used condoms for the actual intercourse, so should I be good? I'm pretty sure nothing ripped or anything of that nature.

Second question: What were the symptoms you personally felt to make you go get tested?

Currently I feel kind of nauseous, and bloated, with diarrhea and my burps are sour. Also I feel kind of achy, it's very minor and I think it could be in my head. I've also felt more tired, but I'm not sure if that qualifies for fatigue. I had a sore throat a couple days ago and it lasted for 2 to 3 with residual effects. I haven't had a fever or night sweats or a rash or really any other symptoms besides sore throats and diarrhea/upset stomach and minor aches. I'd like to add I've also been coughing a lot since the sore throats.

Last question: how does the medication effect your life?

Do you usual feel side effects, or is it unnoticeable?

I'm sorry if I come off as ignorant or offensive. I'm just really nervous. I took oraquick on Thursday and it came back negative, but I'm supposed to take it after 3 months. I have read it is accurate around the 6 week marker, so that should eliminate the first two encounters, but I'm not sure about the third. I'm pretty sure I also got chlamydia or gonorhhea from the third, as I went to get my urine checked. Does this mean I could also have gotten hiv from her?

Edit: Don't worry, I'm not going to have sex again for a while, and I'm done with prostitutes and risky behaviors. I realized that what I really want isn't sex, but just someone in general. Also, of course, am going to get retested. Just wanted to know your opinions.

I really appreciate your responses, and happy holidays, everyone!

Edit 2: just threw up. No fever, "

I had a HIV scare when I went into the doctor to do a basic STD panel and everything came back normal except my HIV test. The 4th generation HIV test initial results came back ""reactive"" and my differentiation test came back indeterminate. The labs proceeded to do a RNA test, which tests for the virus itself and is accurate as soon as 10 days, to confirm the results and it came back as non-detecable. According to the CDC, this is what they call a false positive where the test reacts to something other than HIV in your blood and makes the initial test come back as reactive but the conformation tests are very specific and sensitive for HIV(trust these). I was very scared because I had multiple high risk exposures (the last one occurring 6 days ago) and the doctor said the HIV test is highly accurate but false positives do occur and that clinically HIV was not detected in my blood. 

I brushed off the false positive and returned to my normal life. (Note I am an idiot &amp; you should always get retested especially if you are inside the window period) Flash forward 8 months I was completely healthy until I got a nasty sinus infection that was not going away and was coughing with a sore throat, congestion and loss of weight. I thought back to the false positive I received and googled the symptoms of HIV and everything that popped up fit into my description. I went into panic mode and all I could think about was possible what if scenarios how I contracted it and how every little thing with my body was somehow related to HIV.(seriously I was convinced my tongue had oral thrush, dry cough, occasional diarrhea, loss of appetite). I had crazy anxiety and couldn't eat or sleep, I kept searching the internet and my worries only got worse and worse. I ended up losing like 9 pounds (contributing to my anxiety) and convinced myself I was HIV+. Eventually I had to put my mind at ease and knew the only real way to know if I was HIV+ was to get retested. I got retested with the same 4th generation and everything came back completely normal.

Moral of the story:
1.DO NOT GOOGLE SYMPTOMS - you will drive yourself crazy                                                                              2.The only way to know your status is to get tested                                                                                         3.false positives do occur and be sure to re-test if you receive one

I started dating a guy about a month ago. During the first couple of days we made out a little, but he wouldn't kiss me. when I asked him why, he broke the news - ""I have HIV. I'm not sure how contagious I am or if it can be passed that way so I didn't want to tell you yet."" 
I had never even met, let alone dated an HIV positive person. but I knew when I met him that he was special, and after doing some research and asking if he takes his meds every day,  I decided to be open to it.
Everything has been wonderful. We are like the best of friends and have s great time together. The subject didn't come up often, but he knew I worried about his health all the time and we avoided doing anything too sexual until he could get his levels tested. 
A few weeks ago, however, his room mate (who is also my friend) texted me something strange. He said,  ""I know this is a personal question, but a guy I know said you slept with someone who has an STD and he gave it to you. Do you have anything?"" I was like,  ""To be honest with you I haven't been tested, but I've never had any symptoms of anything so the guy is probably just spreading a rumor. ""
Fast forward to one hour earlier. I'm with my boyfriend chilling at his place. He said he had something to tell me, but begged me not to get mad or leave. He told me he lied about having HIV and that he had tried working up the courage to tell me but hadn't been able to do so until tonight. When I asked him why he lied he said it was because he wanted to see my reaction because he heard that rumor and wanted to make sure that I didn't have it myself. He apologized profusely, begged me not to leave, followed me to my car while I was leaving etc.
I'm still in shock and I don't know what to do. I love this guy, he's like my best friend. I'm relieved that he doesn't have HIV but I'm obviously hurt and angry that he chose the worst possible route to go about trying to find it if I have it. I'm also scared about the possibility of having it after what my friend said, so obviously I'm going to get tested soon, but...?"

I’m a 21 year old Latina female and I made a reddit account because I just wanted to vent; not that any of you really care. I made a really bad decision last year in October when I decided to go out to a club with my coworkers and drink ( I drank 7 shots to be exact). I had recently turned 21 and broken up with my boyfriend of 3 years so why not? Anyways, I ended up meeting a guy (Latino) at the club and we were just hanging out all night. I don’t really know how it happened but we ended up having unprotected vaginal sex. It lasted about 2-5 minutes because he ejaculated really fast. He did pull out but I’m still scared because there could have been an exchange of Precum. Some of my coworkers personally know this guy, and say he is heterosexual and a non iv drug user. He also recently got out of a long term relationship. I texted him and asked him for plan b just in case of anything and he went out of his way and drove 20 minutes to bring me it. I thought it was nice because he was a stranger and he could have easily said no. A couple of days later, I really started to freak out because I started thinking about how I didn’t know anything about his status. I have only been with 2 other men who were both virgin before me. In other words, I would have never slept with this guy if I wasn’t drunk. I texted him and asked him if there was anything that I should be worried about and he told me that he works for a hospital and that he gets a lot of health checkups. He told me that he would go get tested and show me his results and that I was over thinking it. I did end up stalking him on Instagram which did confirm that he does work at the hospital. My friends thought that it would be best if I blocked him and went on my own to get tested. I went 2 weeks after and took an antibody rapid test but, of course, tested negative. The three past months have been so hard because I have had weird symptoms. 

Symptoms:
1) I had a mild yeast infection a week after incident. (Which I am hoping was due to taking Plan B. I was supposed to get my period that week and I think the pill threw my hormone balance off. Plus, I was douching with how disgusted I was in myself, which I think made it worse)
2) I got a minor cold, but everyone around me had a cold. I got the cough, phlegm, runny nose 
3) I started to feel dizzy for a few weeks
4) muscle aches 
5) I thought I had oral thrush but I bought a tongue scraper and my tongue went back to normal 
6) minimal mouth ulcers and body rash (but these are quite normal for me. I have eczema) 
7) I got a weird lump by my ear but everyone has inspected it, and apparently it looks like a scab or scratch 

None of these symptoms have been severe. I have a really weak immune system because I’m always getting sick so I would think if it was HIV, it would be way worse. I’m really hoping that all of these symptoms are because of my health anxiety. It has already been the 3 month period so I am going tomorrow morning to be tested. I am so scared, even though I have already looked up statistics on CDC. I’m afraid that maybe this guy isn’t aware of his status yet &amp; that I will be one of those very unlucky numbers. 

I know it sounds so silly. I just really wanted to vent. I’ve researched HIV like never before and I know it’s not a death sentence but my family would never understand this (being that they are a very traditional Christian Hispanic family)

Wish me the best of luck, I need it!  

Have you guys ever had an HIV scare that resulted in a negative result? "

He was referencing an instance in which a local poz person was outed on Craigslist, but the statement applies to numerous different situations.

On this very sub, I’ve personally witnessed a newly diagnosed person interrupted and asked about their seroconversion symptoms, just because the commenter felt their need for reassurance was more important than he original poster’s personal crisis.

I just witnessed an instance on an HIV magazine’s website in which someone says that while he’s negative, people only have themselves to blame for becoming positive, *even if someone sabotaged the condom*.

This is clearly not how people are normally treated.  In fact, in any other circumstances, people would be shouted down for this sort of behavior.  In some instances (such as the first example I posted) there would be legal repercussions.

Why do they do this?  Is it a sense of smug self satisfaction?  Is it the dehumanization caused by the virus?

An equally important question;  why do we let them get away with it?"

We have been fortunate to come across an amazing human being who we would like to welcome in our family as a third gay partner (Let's call him X), we are both -ve and X advised that he has been +ve since the 90s and is on strict treatment routine to ensure his viral load is undetectable with regular tests to ensure efficiency of drug (currently Trimeq). 

We are a very sexually active couple and do literally everything between us, can you kindly advise:
- What can we do / not do to ensure X is feels welcomed in the bedroom department?
- Can you please recommend a list of Dos / Not Dos sexually (Three men) to avoid transmission. 

We have read a lot on health websites but they don't always go into details from a gay sex context. 

Thanks"

My sister is a sexually active 15 year old (please don’t judge, I know it’s bad). She lost her virginity back last summer (I think around June) and her and her ex-boyfriend didn’t use a condom. He lied to her and ending up climaxing inside of her, and she didn’t get pregnant. They still had sex a lot of times after that. She moved to another state back in late July and got a call the other day from her ex boyfriend to tell her that he just found out that he has HIV and chlymadia. He said he didn’t know how long he had HIV but he wanted to let her know that he had it and that she should get checked out. Back during the summer, she had terrible flu like symptoms for about a week. She told me on the phone earlier that those symptoms started a few weeks after they first had sex. She’s also lost about 30 pounds since summer time but I know she’s not a very active person. I know this isn’t a lot of information, but do you think that it’s possible she may have HIV? She’s getting tested soon but we’re so worried. If she gets tested and pops up negative, is it possible that she may still pop up positive later on? I’m so sorry. I’m scared for my little sister (and please don’t judge, I know the whole situation is fucked up). 

Edit: also forgot to mention that my sister was doing hard drugs during the summer. I wonder if this may have contributed to anything? "

Instantly, it started bleeding (a lot) and I waited for about 3 minutes before the airplane bathroom opened up. I immediately ran inside the bathoom. Once I was inside, I cleaned my nose up and stuck my finger in there to clear out any blood. Then I plugged it up with a tissue. The thing is, had there been semen or blood on my finger from the previous occupant and my finger (covered in this) touched the open bleeding nose scab that I picked, is there a chance I can get HIV infection from this incident? Or for the rest of the flight where I continued to pick my nose, is there a chance I got blood/semen inside my nose from the person sitting next to me and infected myself?

I washed my hands after I finished cleaning my nose. So basically:

1) Is there a chance I got infected?

2) I would also like to add that what if the guys sitting next to me had their blood on my finger and I happened to pick my open nose scab while it was there?

3) Another factor is that while I was holding my bleeding nose, there was still some dripping blood from my nose. Couldn't any potential blood/semen on my finger while I was plugging my nose from someone else have traveled up my nosebleed and into my bloodstream?"

So the thing is last night, I panicked a bit and I tripped and my hand may have touched a used condom. I don't know if my phone or my hands got splashed by it since it was in a puddle, but just in case let's assume that.

I wiped my phone down with clorox but I came home and touched my keyboard with my hands. I know HIV can't transfer from surfaces, but I was wondering if it could have survived on my phone/keyboard and gotten onto my hand and then onto my penis when I was masturbating. Before I masturabted, I washed my hands with soap and water quickly, but hte fact remains that I still touched the phone that may have been splashed by the used condom and my keyboard that came into contact with my hands that may have touched the condom. Am I at risk?

1) Is it possible for HIV to transmit if I masturbated after touching my phone/keyboard which I touched with my hands that may have been in contact with a used condom?

2) Am I at risk because I touched a used condom in a puddle? I don't know if the puddle water lets it live longer.

3) Is it safe to pick my nose even after I've touched the keyboard, mouse, and phone? It's been about a day.

SECOND QUESTION:

So the thing is I spit on the ground A LOT and I was wondering if I could have gotten HIV if one of my spit strands caught some blood/semen and got it back into my mouth. I usually spit pretty hard and I don't know if it comes back to me, but I have a few cuts in my mouth and my hands due to allergies and stuff. I also have a sore in my mouth so I'm a bit worried....

my questions are 1. Did the 4th generation combo test also test for hiv 2 antibodies (should i be worried)? 2. Does the antibodies for hiv 2 also remain in the body forever if someone is infected just like hiv 1 antibodies?

I was the 'top' and insisted on getting a condom on but he kept saying 'in a minute'. It was just as much my fault and I wish I had had the guts to insist he did. But I didn't and I ejaculated. We didn't use lube. 

Anyway...I was paranoid the next day that something wasn't right. But he claimed he tested negative two months before and had had zero other partners. The answer satisfied me but a few days later I realised I had no readon to trust him. I got sick, with a sore throat and a cold and exhaustion this week (which could be attributed to late nights, smoking and working long hours) and I am scared. 

I've never had unprotected sex before and I won't let it happen again. Information on the internet is conflicting and so I would like to know if the chances of me being infected are high or not. Also, is there much point in me getting tested after 3 weeks? How long should I wait?

This is sort of a throwaway, and I am wondering, since this was a year ago.

Back in February 2017 there was another flu epidemic, yadayadayada. Turns out, I had it. For almost two weeks I was sick, and it sucked. I went to my doctor to see get diagnosed, and for sure I was diagnosed with Influenza. I had this thought in the back of my head for the longest time that maybe it was confused with HIV, but it  couldn't have, since there was Influenza bacteria that was found in my throat. I don't remember if I had sex before this, but if I did, I know who it was. 


Thanks!"

I had recently gone in for std testing because it had been a while. I am a disabled person and because of my disability it’s incredibly hard (and painful for me) to have blood drawn so I try to avoid it at all cost. But something inside me was telling me that I have to go get tested. Nothing in particular was wrong. No burning sensation while I pee or anything like that. Anyway, when I got to the health department, I checked myself in and waited to be called back. The wait wasn’t that long which is unusual for the health department. Some guy calls my name, I get up and begin following him through a door and down a long corridor, which ultimately led me to his office. He tells me to “sit down” and asks me “how my morning was going” very nonchalantly which really annoyed me because clearly something is wrong otherwise why would I be here?  Like enough with the small talk. Wtf do I have? I can remember saying to myself in my head “please be the clap, please be the clap, please be the clap. That shit is curable.” Omg he also had to boot up his computer so while he was doing that he kept saying, “let’s see what we got here”.  Anyway, after he boots up the computer and after a few seconds of him clicking his mouse he says, “well looks like you’ve tested positive for HIV.” And then I went completely numb and my mind went somewhere else. At one point he even phoned in some specialist or coordinator and I still can’t remember what that dude said to me over the phone. The other guy, the guy whose office I was in tried getting me to talk about how I was feeling. But I just couldn’t. I was angry, scared, and ashamed. So I asked him if I could just leave. He let me go. I got home and immediately packed a fat bowl of weed. I just wanted to shake off all of what I was feeling. Pot wasn’t enough though. Long story short I got myself some...I’m not sure how much I can reveal here but fuck it.... it rhymes with dystal neth. Just so we’re clear, I’ve never done this before in my life. Pot is all I’ve ever gotten into. I barely even drink. But I ended up going on a four day “neth” bender. I ran out last night and I’m too broke to get anymore. And I’m coming off the stuff and finally am having to face my reality. I’ve been crying on and off this morning since like idk 3 am. It is now almost 10am. I’m tired. I’m exhausted. Idk how the hell im gonna be able to deal with this as a disabled person. I’ve been incredibly depressed the last few yrs because I haven’t been anywhere near where I thought I was gonna be at this point in my life. I also dropped out of college immediately after my diagnoses. I know, I know, my behavior this past week was reckless, and being reckless is how I got HIV. I’m just scared. I’m all alone. I don’t have any friends or family I can talk to. I feel screwed and I can’t stop fucking crying even as I type this. I have my first doctors appt tomorrow and I plan to tell them all of this because I feel myself spiraling out of control and I’m just terrified in general. I guess I just needed to get my thoughts and feelings out somehow so that’s why I’m writing this. "

My thumb had a hangnail on it which I had picked off so there was tons of missing skin there, and it did bleed earlier that evening, like a smaller cut with skin missing. Should I see a doctor? I am scared I contracted HIV. This was like 48 hours ago. He also was handing me more stuff throughout the night and wouldn't put a bandaid on because he didn't seem too concerned.

7 days after my postive screening tests I got my RNA 
result back, negative. (Took two RNA tests)

3 months later....
A lots changed since that false positive. My outlook on life will forever be altered. My emotional state seems permanently heightened. I have this emotional/empathy for others that I never had before, not only towards those with HIV/AIDS, but to everyone. There's almost a sense of sadness that I feel that I try to protect others from feeling. It's strange to say the least. 

To say these results put a strain ony relationship with my fiance is putting it lightly. She stuck by my side the whole time, unwavering, crying behind my back but strong to my face.  

 I no longer use drugs or alcohol (a 15 year drug addict), a switch has been flipped inside of me, what seems to be for the better, time will tell.

 I have my final follow up next week, but my doctor told me I don't need to come in for it, but for my own peace of mind I will be getting my 3 months post potential infections labs. I am still very nervous, as there's still a chance I have HIV-2, as my RNA was for HIV-1 only.  

I still feel like I'm living in a fog. I accepted that I had HIV, there wasn't really anything else to have assumed. I came to terms with it, I was ready to begin treatment. Getting that news of the false positive is indescribable. It's not what most people would assume it felt like, it was true shock, I wasn't jumping up and down, I was just frozen. My brain didn't really understand what was happening until a few hours later.

 From my excruciating research and talks with an HIV specialist, the current treatment seems way more advanced than what the general population is aware of. I have a chronic stomach condition, and the current HIV treatment seems much more mild than my current daily pill and monthly IV infusions. I think the general public should understand that HIV is no longer the death sentence it used to be, and long, healthy lives can be had. My doctor said those with HIV may actually live longer than HIV negative folks as they will be more closely monitored. He was a really conforting doctor and made this while experience much easier for me to handle. 

Anyway, I had to get that off my chest. I still feel very strange mentally."

There's a guest coming up in a few weeks who's a female born HIV+ willing to share her experience on the podcast. I come to you all for possible questions to ask, as I've only done one episode with an HIV+ male in the beginning of this podcast and learned so much from knowing nothing. Please share with me anything you wish people who don't have HIV knew about people living with HIV or the virus in general. If you feel there's more for HIV+ people to know about living with HIV, please share that as well so that this can be a useful resource to the world. Thank you in advance!

I am a gay 27 years old and from a conservative &amp; religious background so I am not someone with a lot of sexual experience. I only had sex with one ex five years ago and have had very few hook ups. However, the few I have hooked up with have sorta left me with a lot of anxiety.

I was semi dating a guy 4 years ago who, while he was incredibly attractive, was a bit of a douchebag. We ended up hooking up one night and we almost had sex but I did not want it to go so far so he stopped. He shorty after got back with his ex so I stopped talking to him, especially since was often manipulative. He then continues messaging me and to get me to talk to me he says, ""it is urgent, it is about a test"". I call him frightened and he tells me he took an ""IQ test"" and found out he has a high IQ. I told him off and told him how sick that was and blocked his number.

One year later, I began talking to another guy who was very sweet and had an incredible personality. He was great - professional, family oriented, sweet, etc. We ended up messing around once, and then the next day, tells me out of the blue that he has HIV... I felt uneasy. This wouldn't have stopped me from dating him, but I was put off by the fact that he did not tell me this before we messed around. I realize the chances of me getting HIV are slim, but I almost went all the way with him and he was not stopping me (I stopped because I remembered my past experience). I got tested and fortunately, I was negative.

Fast forward to now many years later.... I went on a date with a guy about three weeks ago from my school. We ended up messing around, and while I was laying down, he went on top of me and grabbed my penis and inserted it inside him. I did not have a condom and this was definitely more than I bargained for, but I didn't stop it. I asked him afterwards if he was clean and he told me he was. I asked him a little later again and he said ""yes... are you?"" And I told him I was. Fast forward to this past week and I've had a light sore throat for days that has gotten a bit better and sneezing/mucus in the throat. I have high energy and no rashes, but I guess you could say I am paranoid now after all sexual experiences. I realize I am probably negative, but I just wanted to ask because I want to get a different POV and overcome this anxiety."

This month, President Trump and Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services Alex Azar unveiled the administration’s plan to lower prescription drug prices, but health policy experts are warning that the proposals fall short of the promises he made on the campaign trail and will do little to address the root causes of the issue. The plan received criticism for being too easy on pharmaceutical companies for their role in the seemingly exponential recent rise in drug prices.

For the first time today, I allowed him to penetrate me (a male) without a condom for a brief period -- probably around a minute or so, no ejaculation. I consider myself somewhat well-educated about HIV and know that the risks of me getting infected from an undetectable partner are pretty much non-existent, but one detail has me worried.

A couple of nights ago, we both went out and used cocaine. I had a little, he had significantly more. I know that's not good for my health and especially not for his, but would this use have any effect on his undetectable status, even just temporarily? I'm not sure if I'm just anxious because condomless sex with him is new to me or if I put myself at risk because his viral load could be fluctuating right now.

Sorry if this is a stupid question but I have no idea how quickly viral load can change or if casual coke use (maybe 2 times a month) is enough to really change things."

18 month ago i went to a party and before the party i was drinking alchohol and i passed out, then i woke up in this random car( ive been passed out like 1 hour? 1:30 max i think) and i was in the copilot seat and he was in the pilot seat, when i woke up he started asking me gay questions and i said to him that i wasnt gay at all and he tried to touch me and i told him that i wansnt gay and then i told him to leave me at the party and i was really close of the party and he left me.

8 weeks laters i had this flu (sore throat, fever, mocus in nose, but not swollen lymph nodes or rash or diarrhea) and it lasted like 2 weeks.

around a year after the incident i develop seborreic dermatitis in the scalps of the nose and in the eyebrows, it was very mild, people couldnt tell that i have something and with treatment it went away in like 2 weeks, (also i have oily skin around the nose)

now 18 months later i had tonsillitis and it cured in like a week, and i think i am developing like a jock itch, its a little red near the scrotum and its itchy so i think that it is. and also my skin in my nose is always dry and oily and its frustrating.

i am very anxious because 8 weeks after the incident i had a flu like symptom and ive seen also the seborreic dermatitis and jock itch is also part of hiv symptoms, ive been very anxious since that incident and i dont know if i may have it.

from what i remember when i woke up was that my clothes werent dirty, just a little bit becuase i puke, my butt or butthole wanst hurting( i think its a sign that i wasnt raped or something otherwise please tell me)andthis is waht i remember from that day, and i dont remember anything about my mouth

i am also a male and i live in peru."

Not sure why she cried but I mentioned I wouldn’t mind getting transmitted by her and I don’t like using condoms with a lady I believe I love and willing to risk for.  I did not pause or think through and said all that. 

We didn’t have sex at the end, I was told to calm down and rethink my choices.

I did some read up afterwards and pretty certain I’m willing to get transmitted by her after everything. It’s just social stigma, who cares if  im not going to care? Am I childish, foolish or what? 
Back to my question, should I get transmitted by her and live with medication? Yes, I do wish to marry her. My financial stability  is solid, I don’t think I would have any issues in health cost. I have yet consulted my parents for fear they take steps to separate our relationship. It is my intent to go through the sexual intercourse before informing.

Thank you to everyone who's helped with that. I'd like some insights as I haven't dealt with this situation before. My friend's mom was HIV+ and passed away 1-2 years ago. He never said why and I never thought it was a big deal because no matter what, he lost his mom. Yesterday, we went out as a group for a friend's birthday. I had on a Something Positive for Positive People tank top. He looked at it, smiled and opened up to me that his mom was HIV+ and shared that he would like to talk about it on the podcast. There's a lot I want to get insight on here but I think the most important things are:
1. He opened up, so I let him talk. We were in a group of about 6 people which let me know he was comfortable talking about it. Some friends added to the conversation with understanding that HIV is manageable and mentions of being undetectable came up along with a few other terms only an educated person would know about HIV. Did I respond well to just let him talk? I wasn't openly shocked about him sharing his mom had HIV, I was shocked that he was able to openly discuss his mom because he took her passing HARD (as any son would). 
2. I wanted to ask questions but I think he covered all the things anyone would be naturally curious about like how was she managing it. He said everything was fine with her until other health issues became a concern which was the only time having HIV was an issue. How can I navigate this conversation in a useful, informative manner being mindful of my friend having lost his mom AND being able to inform listeners through his experience? I hope that statement makes sense. 

I tried to provide the most relevant context in this post. He wants to help, he made that clear. I believe I can be open and say 'hey man I may say the wrong thing just out of not knowing so bear with me', but it's my intention to . . . let this be his gift to his mother sharing their experience to help SOMEONE. I want to do this right. I'm open to private messages but would love open discussion here on what can be done. 

Thank you all in advance!"

At the moment though half of my face has erupted in what i believe is seborrheic dermatitis. It's making me fairly self-conscious when I'm outside. I have had mild cases of it before on my face when I use a face wash that is too harsh. But this is the worst it's ever been and covers more of my face than usual. 

What are your experiences with skin issues after starting treatment? Will this go away once I begin treatment?"

Luckily he did not ejaculate inside me, so If anything, there was only Precum present, but I’m sure there were tears present . Two weeks later I came down with a fever, aches, and fatigue. I had never been so scared or stressed in my life. I also acquired a yeast infection and a dry mouth at that time. I went to the dr. For testing 2 weeks post exposure and everything came back negative. I asked the stealther a millions times about his recent activity before me. He stuck with his story that he hadn’t had any recent possible exposures and he knew he didn’t have anything. Two years later I am Entering a relationship. The stealther has entered a relationship since then as well and I have not received a call from the health department or him saying I should get tested.

I  went to my doc three weeks ago for another HIV check. My results never  came in and nobody ever called me. I found, today, under PATIENT MEDICAL  RECORDS (but the LAB RESULTS are not updated) the following  information:

**""Contact with and (suspected) exposure to human immunodeficiency virus \[HIV\] -- ACTIVE""**

**""Taking PREP (paraphrase) -- ACTIVE""**

The  first result stating ACTIVE doesn't mean I have HIV does it? WHy has  nobody called me? Why aren't my results updated? Again, this is not  listed under LABS but under Medical Records. I'm freaking out.

Edit:  Maybe I'm freaking out. I looked at the Medical Records for back in  March and it states the same thing but doesn't list ACTIVE beside it  (it's actually just blank). Maybe it's just the billing code for the  reason of visit?"

Im sorry to post yet another ""scared of HIV"" post but i am really concerned, but i am not sure i have any reason to, so if you are able to, please calm my scared mind :)

17 days ago, i had a ""sexual"" encounter with a professional dominatrix, where i received a vibrator/dildo in my anal cavity (i am male)

13 days after the encounter, i got flu like symptoms, like fever and i have been sleeping alot. (i am still a bit sick at the time of writing)

There was ofcourse condoms on the sextoys and no direct intercourse took place, also i am fairly sure that the sextoys where cleaned, due to the amount of alcogel present at the facilty (and the fact that she is a professional with years of experience)

on day 16, i started to develop these red bumps on my skin which are itching and seem to be spreading.

i am Obiviously gonna get tested but i have to wait for day 30 after possible exposure for the test to be conclusive - the test is the ""combination test"" which tests for both hiv antibodies and hiv antigenomes.

Can anybody offer some facts to calm my ( a bit ) stressed psyche?  


I appreciate it, thanks.

So I have been sexually active with this girl, since about May of this year. Now we are both virgins when we first had sex and I know she has had no STD’s, and I completely trust her on that since we both had to overcome a lot of anxiety to get to that point. I’ve only seen her get the flu once in our relationship and it was like doctor diagnosed flu. Well at the start of the summer I started to continually get sick over and over which I thought was just my labor intensive job causing this. An example of this recently is I have had issues at school, where from September - December of 2017 I always had an ear infection every month (which during that time I had my blood donated so I know I didn’t have HIV then.) Well cut to the beginning of this summer where I have an ear infection in both ear at the start of the summer, after that I did fine until July 5 when I thought I had another ear infection so I went to the doctor and they had no idea what it could be so they just sent me home with antibiotics. The symptoms are so similar to tonsillitis rather than mono or HIV. I had an allergy appointment due for a while to get shots because of all these illnesses but the tonsillitis never went away so we thought maybe we should go early to the ENT and see what’s going on and maybe I can make my appointment for shots early. Well the doctor looks in my throat and sees an ulcer on my tonsils, he doesn’t even acknowledge any other symptoms I had except the ulcer and told me I might have HIV, mono, an autoimmune disease, or cancer. 


I am not at all sure what to do with that news. I don’t know if the doctor was just giving me all the possibilities and happened to scare me in the process or what. What do you all think? I have had my blood tested and I’m waiting on the results for that.

I recently went for a blood test due to worrying I might have arthritis (fingers ache, especially in the morning), and my doctor called me to tell me that my white blood cell count was slightly low (1.7 as opposed to 2.0). We have OCD in my family, and for some reason I instantly thought it might be due to HIV.

I'm bisexual, and have had intercourse with 4 women, 1 man. I recently came out of a two year relationship with my male ex. I'm not sure if this is relevant, but I was top and he was bottom.

Since then, I have seen two people. A girl, and a guy. The girl (the fourth female) I had unprotected sex with for 30 seconds. I hadn't known her that long and I was nervous, so I decided to stop. The guy, we both gave each other oral sex twice each. As far as I know, neither have had an HIV test before. 

The people before that have either been virgins, or have had HIV tests coming back negative. It's specifically the two recent people I am concerned about.

Any advice appreciated. Thank you. "

I don't know what do you do if some police ask u for the medication... It's a pain in the ass...  this prohibition feed up the stigma and criminalize the undetectable people...because if u are hiv+ and don't know or don't take medication no one can prevent you for entering. 
Also i wanted to live for a season in a Islamic country but i imagine that's science fiction... Is it possible to mail medication from differents countries??  Has anyone do that??

I had protected vaginal sex with a girl with many sexual partners.

After like 7-8th day I started feeling fatigue and lack of energy which continued till now. It followed by headaches and high body temperature but not fever. I knew something was going wrong and started feeling dry mouth with bad taste in couple of days which I still have it. Most scary was that I found my tongue with white coating and other strange thing was continuous growling stomach sounds which I still have it all the time. Other main concern was I lost my appetite and lost body weight by 5 kg which is 10% of my total body weight. I don’t eat all day or may be just one small meal and I don’t feel hungry at all and I have feeling of throwing up all the time since then. 
I have noticed night sweats and rashes on my both leg thigh after a month. 
My friends says that it is anxiety related but It’s hard for me to accept that fact coz I know something has gone wrong with my body. 

I am looking for a 4th generation duo test next week but I am even scared to think of if it’s hiv. 
Any suggestion if it could be something else like other STD or something? 

please advice over my situation.  "

I will parse the new recommendations in the comments section later, or you’re welcome to. The big ones are: No more checking CD4 counts regularly for folks with sustained counts &gt;250, discontinuation of azithromycin as prophylaxis against MAC in long-term healthy patients with low CD4 counts, new guidelines including the new drugs as first line options (Biktarvy), and intermittent PrEP (!!) for episodic sex.

The International Antiviral Society–USA Panel has updated recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs in the treatment and prevention HIV infection.

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. – The International Antiviral Society–USA Panel has released updated recommendations for the treatment and prevention of HIV infection in adults, as published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (https://media.jamanetwork.com). Michael Saag, MD, director of the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s Center for AIDS Research, served as the article’s lead author.

The recommendations, developed by a volunteer panel of international experts in HIV research and patient care, outline new findings, drugs, approaches, and data as updates to previous recommendations from 2016, and are intended to be used as guidelines by clinicians moving forward.

Their conclusions indicate that continued advances in the development of antiretroviral drugs for HIV prevention and treatment are necessary and also are contributing to improved clinical management and outcomes for individuals at-risk for or living with HIV.

“The recommendations reflect the joint commitment of researchers working to collectively improve clinical outcomes and treatments available for all at-risk or infected HIV patients,” Michael Saag, MD, professor of medicine in UAB’s Division of Infectious Diseases. “We know that antiretroviral therapy is the cornerstone of prevention and management of HIV infection, but it’s critical to continually evaluate new data and treatments for initiating therapy, monitoring individuals starting therapy, changing regimens, and preventing HIV infection for those at-risk, reaffirming the standard of providing the utmost treatment and care possible.”

In addition to reconfirming 2016 recommendations of using antiretroviral therapy (ART) as a substantial means of HIV treatment and prevention, updated recommendations include but are not limited to:
Updated initial regimens, focused primarily on unboosted integrase strand transfer inhibitor (InSTI) regimens

Encouraged rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy, including same day initiation, if feasible

Recommendations against routine use of mycobacterium avium complex prophylaxis for those with advanced disease on effective antiretroviral therapy

Recommendations for discontinuation of routine CD4 count lab testing once a patient has sustained undetectable HIV RNA levels for a year and has a CD4 count above 250 cells/ul

An alternative for pre-exposure prophylaxis for those who are uninfected with HIV but remain at risk for infection to now include an episode-based approach where individuals can take preventative ART pills prior to exposure, and a follow up pill once daily for two days-post exposure

“HIV care continues to evolve and clinicians and their patients benefit from applying the latest knowledge to keep pace with the many ways this has changed,” said Paul Volberding, MD, professor at the University of California San Francisco. “The latest IAS–USA guidelines continue a tradition of providing a concise and current set of recommendations and we are proud of how these have captured the directions in our field of medicine.”

According to the article, all updated recommendations focus on adults 18 years or older with or at-risk for HIV infection with availability to most antiretroviral drugs.

Persistant symptoms:
Canker sores in mouth and raised bumps
Bumps and sores in the genital area
Rash on thighs; the skin affected by the rash is so sensitive that if I lightly scratch it, it leaves a raw red mark with smooth edges
Fungal overgrowths on skin; small scaled patches and white patches that don't tan in the sun

Temporary symptoms:
Onset of diarrhoea 2 weeks after symptoms began that lasted for a week
Extreme fatigue that lasted for a month

Do these sound exclusively like HIV symptoms?
HIV seems to be the only STD whose symptoms can show and persist after 3 months. However, the chances of contracting HIV in this nature are slim, but I suppose that someone has to be the unlucky one. I have a weird feeling about syphilis, so I'll get checked for that in the meantime."

It is their presence                     over the centuries that has developed a close relationship with host, without these genes many of our organism functions are impaired or turned off.

2.EliteControllers

Among people infected with HIV some are those whose organisms alone are able to maintain the undetectable level of viral load and although you can not prove that they got rid of the virus, they do not have any ailments associated with HIV and will never progress AIDS, such people are EliteControllers. However, despite many studies, it was impossible to determine what is the secret of these people. Although most probably all is about their immune system to produce so-called broad-neutralizing antibodies.

3. Solution

The elaboration presents the proposed solutions to the mystery of the unique EliteControllers feature, and as such it would be a cure for AIDS. And because it is about re-launching the immune system it is very possible the same as the EC cope with HIV, it is the same with other viruses and pathogens or mutated cells. So any disease dependent on the immune system will have a benefit.

4. Base of problem in AIDS

In essence, the problem with the HIV virus is that it infects the immune cells of Thelper lymphocytes that task is to teach the immune system by antigen recognition. In the proposed Hypothesis I pointed to existence of alternative mechanism of antigen presentation. It is based on cooperation between bacteria commensal, which ""mediates"" in the presentation of antigens, thus allowing the production of many types against all virus mutations. Exactly as it happens with EliteControllers and their production of so-called bnab. (broad neutralizing antibodies).

5.Microbiome diversity

Among infected and uninfected persons, research was carried out to determine the diversity of bacterial species of their microbiome. From the image that emerges from the research, you can see people with acute infection lose bacteria from the bacteroides species. Among these bacteria we can indicate for specific species that are crucial for the education of our immune system. While the latest research which were published on November 28, 2017 indicate the existence of a close relationship between the diversity of the microbiome and viral load. The more diverse the microbiome, the lower the viral load. Such a dependence allows one to draw the assumption that the essence of maintaining viral load in check is rich and diverse microbiome which contains species responsible for the education of our immune system.

6. Antibiotics and chemotherapy.  

Due to the fact that antibiotics are pharmacological agents that target bacteria, use them with all it certainly reduces the diversity of our microbiome. Recent research proves that some strains of bacteria after cessation of antibiotic therapy never rebuild their populations. What can lead to various ailments including chronic inflammation, allergies, depression, obesity, diabetes, overgrowth of candida or autism or as hypothesis states even to AIDS.

7. Autism and neurodegenerative diseases.

As the scientists show, intestinal bacteria control the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. The barrier that has to protect the brain from infections or toxins, it is created through close connections between cells endothelium, located in the blood vessels. The barrier is so tight that most of the protein and molecules will not get inside. Those that can get into the brain need selective transport through specific receptors. An analogous barrier is, of course, in the gut. Researchers compared the development of the blood-brain barrier of a sterile and normal fetus. In mice with a normal microbiota proper closure of the blood-brain barrier with the development of the fetus has been demonstrated. Antibodies detected at the beginning of development the fetus, which entered the brain without any problems, were already limited at the end of the fetal period. In mice with the sterile antibody microbiota continued to cross the blood-brain barrier.

8. HCV.

""The self-healed (HCV) self-healing predominates Th1-type responses. It is strong, highly specific and broad, i.e. directed against many epitopes of structural proteins and non-structural high-HCV degree of conservativeness. The lack of this type of response leads to chronic virus infection. In infection Chronic specific T-cell response to HCV epitopes is detectable in both peripheral blood and in the blood liver. However, it is significantly too weak to be sufficient to eradicate the virus. "" Self-healing is the production of antibodies by humans against a wide spectrum of all virus mutations.

9. Aids without HIV?  

There is more than 5,000 documented cases of AIDS without HIV, how is this possible? AIDS is not a disease it is a syndrome of a dozen diseases that are observed during various stages the development of infection. Diseases that also occur in non-infected people, that is why , we can have two people with pneumonia and one has AIDS and the other does not, although their disease state is not different except one is infected with HIV or rather had developed antibodies against HIV antigens. For a long time, to the present moment, people are appearing in many places in the world which despite many symptoms indicating an acute HIV infection have nonreactive tests.

[https://ehealthforum.com/health/certain-hiv-positive-but-negative-tests-t229803.html](https://ehealthforum.com/health/certain-hiv-positive-but-negative-tests-t229803.html)

So-called screening tests are non-reactive and such people can not get help for the infected. For such people, the hypothesis I propose may turn out to be very much helpful because it explains the cause of the ailment. If you are one one of them help Yourself and me by upvoting this article. It’s worth adding that there are possibility that many of viruses similar to HIV are circulating in our veins because according to latest research by Stephen Quake from Stanford University more than 99% of microbes inside us are unknown to science!

r/https://news.stanford.edu/press-releases/2017/08/22/nearly-microbes-unknown-science/

Finally, it should be added that HIV does not meet Koch's postulates, and the AIDS epidemic which was so much feared, has never exploded. It was expected to be typical outburst increase in infections, but nothing like that happened. New cases of AIDS did not appear in accordance with probability but randomly. And before L.Montagnier only linked the HIV virus to AIDS in 1983, there were drug theories, stimulants or other chemicals used in homosexual environments where did most of the illness come from.

[http://www.tomaszgabis.pl/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/raport\_o\_aids.pdf](http://www.tomaszgabis.pl/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/raport_o_aids.pdf)

It is possible that AIDS to be emmerged when one of the chemotherapeutics was accidentally discovered, an antimicrobial agent which was effective against trichomonad vaginitis and bacterial gingivitis and other venereal diseases.  

r/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC89320/

Perhaps it is not coincidence that homosexual community is one that has used these drugs much more often than the rest of society. And therefore MSM became first victims of this new drug. The drug that is in use until today has in its leaflet a warning about the potential carcinogenic effect, quoting:

""There are results of studies indicating the effect of tumor growth in rats and mice. Following oral administration in mice, there was an increase in lung cancer. However, this is not due to the genotoxic mechanism, because the increase in the degree of mutation has not been demonstrated in various organs, including lungs, in transgenic mice after high doses of the chemotherapeutic agent ""

[https://www.leki-informacje.pl/sites/default/files/Charakterystyka-Metronidazole\_B.Braun\_.pdf](https://www.leki-informacje.pl/sites/default/files/Charakterystyka-Metronidazole_B.Braun_.pdf)

Therfore In the light of new knowledge about human genetics, we already know this chemotherapeutic it has genotoxic effects because it kills the genes of our hologenom. Genes without which our immune system becomes blind. And it causes all spectrum of similar symptoms that are associated with HIV infection.

It should be remembered that antibiotics often save life, you should not be afraid of them, however, you should pay a lot more attention to our microbiome after using them. Because microbiome  imbalance can cause remarkably serious health effects.

Our microbiota is the basis of health and not its complement."

It’s nice that people are being educated to not use phrases like “clean”, but this seems like window dressing on a slaughterhouse.  Sure, PC words are nice, but addressing the entrenched sexual and legal discrimination against Poz folks would be nicer.  I worry that we create a false sense of progress when we talk about “stigma” without actually talking about stigma.  Seems a bit like talking about the history of racism without mentioning slavery.

Around 25 days later when I got my period I started experiencing immense burning in my vagina and there were reddish ulcers in the inner vaginal walls (like you’d really have to stretch my inner labia Minora out to see) 

During that time I also had a really bad cough/cold and horrible sore throat 

Sores healed and starting to feel like things are normal but my body has been tingling all over. Hands, feet, thighs, buttocks and sometimes face. Fingers and palms feel itchy.

Saw a single line of rash on both thighs. It was like a blood clot and a reddish purplish single line and it disappeared in 2-3 days

Or we would have P in V sex ALWAYS with a condom he was very good about that since I wasn’t on birth control. So we only were together a few months and before we broke up he went back to his country Kuwait and when he came back I performed oral sex and then he broke up with me [yeah I know]. At the time I thought nothing of this until now as I have a new boyfriend. 


So fast forward to now I’ve been with my current boyfriend sexually about 3 months. I decided to go on birth control since we became more serious. At planned parenthood they took my urine sample the they asked me if I wanted to send it in for std testing so I said yes. I got a call back that I was positive for gonorrhea. Because I was positive I told my boyfriend and he went to get tested and cured. The doctor said since we were together that long he would most likely be positive. A few days later they call him to tell him he was completely clean and that meant I would’ve carried it for almost a year!! He believes that it was a false positive so I’m mad I didn’t get retested. Anyways because of this he wanted to get tested for everything blood test and all, he came back clean for all of that as well. So now that he brought this up I am now completely terrified that if I had gotten gonorrhea then was else could I have gotten? 

Is it normal to feel this nervous about getting this test done? How high are these chances and should I not feel so scared? 

I’m so terrified to hear the results but honestly even more I’m scared to have a positive result and need to end my relationship with current boyfriend.

I recently met a guy. We've been talking for a few weeks and had our first date tonight. It went surprisingly amazing, and I can definitely see myself falling for him the more I get to know him. He happens to be HIV+ which doesn't scare me away, but how much of a risk am I taking if/when we decide to have sex. Even with protection. He gets blood tests and takes medication, and stays on top of it, and told me that he is in undetectable levels at this point. Is this the equivalent of someone without HIV? Is protection during sex mandatory every time? Can I contract it from oral sex or making out? 

Any info would be greatly appreciated. "

I want to understand something about the nature of HIV testing and how the virus develops.  


Before receiving any medicine I had some blood drawn and I believe I was told that sample would not be tested on itself, but act as something of a 'baseline' to compare to in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is-- if after a course of PEP and after being tested negative at both 4 weeks and 4 months from exposure-- whether it's possible to determine if you were genuinely infected and managed to prevent the virus from taking hold vs. having not actually been infected in the first place.  


This leads onto a related question; is that initial blood sample a 'snapshot' in time? Will the virus develop in that blood sample the same way were it to have remained in the body? After 4 weeks, were that blood to contain the virus, would the virus begin to become detectable, or does blood 'die' when removed from the body?

&amp;#x200B;

I'd really appreciate any insight into all this to hopefully understand things better."

All is not lost though.  She is subject to the general election.  If you live in Georgia’s 48th district, you have the power to help her political legacy become a bad memory.

And if you don’t live in GA 48, don’t forget that her husband, Tom Price, was former secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services.

*That’s right, her husband was a senior political appointee and one of the leading figures who designs our health policy*.  I don’t know about the rest of you guys, but most married people share political and social opinions.

All of us need to do our part to ensure that the administration that supports these types of monsters has as little power as possible.  Make sure you’re registered, find out where to vote and get your asses to the polls on November 6."

Im not hiv positive but i still have some questions. I've seen a poster lately (in Germany) about HIV. The person was like"" i have pills against HIV but not against mean comments"". I didn't quite understand what they meant by that. After that i got home and watched some videos about HIV/aids and it seems like people actually getting bullied/harassed very often bec they are hiv/aids positive(at school, work...). I really don't understand why. Im a person that loves dark humor but i still don't get why people would do that. Like if sb would tell me that he/she is HIV/aids positive i wouldn't say something else, ill just keep on talking about the subject we were talking about. I cant change anything about it, you cant change anything about and also because of the fact that you could die from it i wouldn't say sth mean or a joke. Could you pls explain me the reason why they would get harassed like that?"

For those who have a resistant strain or have difficulty finding a good combination of anti viral medication that is effective... This study shows that sulforaphane is effective at inhibiting the virus so could act as a supplement to your AVT.

It also has a ton of health benefits and is found in all cruciferous vegetables.

I had sex with a condom took it off and started grinding on her butt. My penis definitely touched the outside of her anus without the condom and I was thrusting really hard. I put condom back on and we had anal but then took it off and continued rubbing really hard against her anus. We hooked up about 4-5 times but the last time is when i decided to grind on her butt against her anus. Within a week I had an ordinary fever that lasted about 3 days then went away. I understand this post is paranoid. I ordered an oraquick online so I am gonna check myself but waiting for it is driving me insane. It’s been 5 months and I haven’t had any symptoms as far as I can tell except for that fever and I’ve noticed my freckles and moles have gotten a little bigger which is concerning bc it leads me to believe there has been a change to my immune system.  Or maybe I’m at the age where your childhood freckles and moles get a little bigger (I’m 22). Anyways...I’m wondering if anyone on here has acquired hiv from something that was considered low risk. I know my post may sound ignorant but I am confused from what I read online. I know rectal fluid has a high concentration of the virus and my penis definitely touched rectal fluid as her hole was more open since I had anal with her and felt lubrication. I have heard hiv can only survive a few seconds outside the body in fluid so theoretically her hiv could’ve been viable since my penis was the first thing to make contact with the rectal fluid. I realize how incredibly ignorant this sounds but the points I brought up are sincere concerns of mine.

June 7th I did unprotected oral with a tooth decay with an exposed nerve its open but it was hurting before the incident due to me eating. I  peform oral sex on the guy, no ejaculation didnt happen but im worry about precum. After I was feeling great after the incident didn’t think much about it.7 days after I did protected anal sex I think (guy I met off the internet) but I was drunk and didn’t know but I trust him. That night I got sick fever,night sweats and sore throat so I went online and google said I was infected with HIV. I was in panic and blanked out. Next morning which was 4 weeks after the possible exposure I went to the emergency room and did strep test on me,which they diagnosed me with viral pharyngitis aka Sore Throat. Then they called and said I had Strep Throat due to the culture. So I got 2 shots of antibiotics in my hip along with amoxicillin for 10 days.I was still saddened and worried so I tried to look online but it was making it worse.I went to go get tested 10 days after the oral situation,told her my story and she did a Stds Test on me and told me they were gonna call me in a few days.The Hiv Test I took can detect the acute infection to 4 to 12 days and also do other tests aswell. They called me and said I was negative with all STds and also keep in mind I was still worried. Days went by I was crying,new symptoms such as my legs were shaking when I did my run,chest pain and hot heads (not a fever)were popping up and I just was falling apart. At 3 weeks did a rapid test and that came up negative.At this point I’m trying to move on and get ready for college but my thoughts wouldn’t let me move on.Then I was thinking of Suicide because I wasn’t sleeping,I was crying too much,I wasn’t even feeling well.so I went to ER told them my story I was just mentally breaking down.So a nurse came in and she took some blood to see if I’m okay and they put me in this room for 1hr 30 mins until she came and said “Your fine and your blood is fine “I was asked can I let that HIV fear go she said yes I can because they would’ve been able to detect the virus. so I was moving and I was happy that I can move on with my life. I realized my tongue was kinda white and it was like this for a while so I went online and they told me it was a symptom of HIV so then my fear went back up. my throat is sore on and off so I’m scared once again.I went to go get tested for herpes but that came up negative. so now I’m dealing with a sore throat with some mucus my neck lymph nodes aren’t swollen but my groin is but they aren’t visible but I can feel them. I had a sore on my bottom lip and one in my upper gum so I wanna cry and give upp but it’s just sooo much I’m 19,going to college and want to become an architect ,and adopt kids but I don’t want this to ruined me. I also sent you 2 tongue pics of how it was In June ,I have heard antibiotics can do your tongue like that but idk please someone help me."

The PIV intercourse lasted around 3-5 minutes and I didn’t ejaculate.   This week I started experiencing weird flu like symptoms, but not what I typically get. Also, I live in Australia and it’s Spring now, but apparently there’s a flu going on around Melbourne at the moment. 

Anyway, since early this week I had extremely mild sore throat that would cone and go. I would even say it’s more of a discomfort even. But what really bothers me is that since Thursday, my whole body is extremely sore and weak. It started with soreness in my upper back and I thought it was just me being tired from work, but now I had it for 4 days and it was so bad on Friday that I had to take a day off from work. It’s better now, but my body feels extremely weak and the pain (even though it’s better now) moves from my upper back, to shoulders and arms and sometimes chest. I also have a bit of a cough, but not much. I had no high fever during this period, no enlarged lymph nodes, no diahrrea, no nausea or vomiting or any other common HIV symptoms, but my body never felt this sore and weak.

I’m going to see my doctor next week and ask to get tested, but I’m extremely paranoid. I know that HIV is really not that common these days and even harder to get, but I’m really anxious. Is extreme body soreness and weakness with no fever or any other major symptoms sounds like it could be HIV? Thanks to all in advance."
9yaej9,Did you do something stupid and now you're scared you have HIV?,https://www.reddit.com/r/hivaids/comments/9yaej9/did_you_do_something_stupid_and_now_youre_scared/,PositivelyBroken,1,2018-11-18 14:14:51,0,/r/hivaids/comments/9yaej9/did_you_do_something_stupid_and_now_youre_scared/,NaN,"Hello everyone! I'm going to talk to two groups of people. First is to the paranoid, anxious hysterical individuals who think they have HIV but we all know they don't. Next, is to everyone who actually does. 

So, you had an unsafe, risky encounter. You engaged in oral sex without a condom, anal, vaginal, shared a needle, gave a high-5 to someone who is HIV positive or sat on a wet toilet seat. Whatever the case may be, you're convinced you've been exposed to the virus. Now you're worried and begin obsessing over internet searches of early signs and symptoms, seroconversion, medication, disclosure, laws, cures, death, statistics, rejection, stigma, infectious disease doctors and everything in between. You read a couple symptoms that you swear you've had recently and now you're panicking. Why did I sneeze an hour ago? I had a cough last week, am I infected? Oh no, that sore throat last year or that pimple the other day must be an HIV rash. Basically, you're sure those cluster of symptoms you may or may not have had are a clear indicator of HIV. So to make yourself feel better and to get some reassurance, you find a blog site like Reddit and you write a post to HIV infected people about how horrible the disease is and how you feel like your life might be over because of the 0.001% chance you might have the virus. Instead of doing the logical thing like getting tested or talking to a medical professional, you seek a diagnosis from HIV infected strangers on the internet in hopes someone will say something to ease your nerves. You go on to tell everyone how you're sure you have it and that you're so anxious and scared and your life is ruined. Mind you, you're actually talking to people with the virus. So, how do you think that makes people living your nightmare feel? When you tell them how you were 'clean' (which is offensive by the way!) a year ago. It's OK to be scared and it's OK to ask for help and seek reassurance, but I ask that you please try to be a little more sensitive and considerate. You come on here because you're scared and then when you find out you're not infected, you forget the experience ever happened and you don't bother educating yourself or want anything to do with the disease because it doesn't affect you. So why should you care? If you're here because you are scared and then find out you are OK, the least you can do is educate yourself on the virus so that you are better informed and are better prepared for next time. 

To everyone else, I know it is annoying. Everyday there is someone on here stigmatizing everyone else with HIV because of a no possibility they were even infected. They go around saying things that are hurtful and offensive without realizing it so you attack. To you guys, I know how you feel but I say this. Do you remember what it was like for you before you were infected? The fear you felt when you realized the possibility existed? How alone you were, clueless and ill informed? I bet you did not know certain things were considered offensive or hurtful. I'm sure you thought a non-risky encounter you had at one point in time was the end of the World. Try to remember how you were before you entered this life and treat others accordingly. Reassure them and educate them. If they say something hurtful, point it out to them. Encourage them to stay informed, whether they are infected or not. We've all been there I'm sure, so try not to take it too personally. To combat the stigma, we have to first make people aware. So the next time someone post something stupid about fearing they're about to die because they kissed someone that might have HIV, explain to them why that's dumb, encourage them to get tested and stay informed. Thanks!"

I’ve been tested three times, by two different labs, both did blood work and urine. Once two days after, and the burning sensation and discharge was cleared up with a shot in the upper butt cheek and some heavy antibiotics. But it was entirely too early and all results came back negative across the board. Then five months later, and again at seven months, which both concluded I have HSV1. 

I haven’t had any severe sicknesses, but after my mom died back in May, I did relapse on booze, dropped smoking pot, quit comfort eating regularly, and went from weighing my average of 143 to 133. Shortly after, a best friend was murdered. I only get night sweats when I’m drinking heavily or quitting during the first few nights. I’m wondering if the weight loss could be HIV related or stress, anxiety, and depression related.

I’m just concerned if it’s possible that if I were infected with HIV, could it slip by blood work five and seven months after exposure? 

I’ll be getting tested again soon.

Thank you."

I just came to Thailand yesterday where I was to accompany my father for an operation (he divorced from my mother and has been living here the last 6 years), only to find out he has HIV. 
His CD4 is 114 and viral load is +820,000 copies/ml. 

I have 4 key questions:

1. We want to bring him back to the UK in the next couple of days where he can be around family and get the treatment he needs, but we’re unsure if it is even remotely safe to have him on a plane for 16 hours given his low immunity.

2. If we can bring him to the UK, treatment may not happen for a few weeks as he gets himself to a GP, does tests etc. Is this too long to wait?

3. We’re also scared about contracting it ourselves. He is covered in open and closed sores, do I need to use gloves when I touch him?

4. I cannot imagine what he is going through, does anyone have any advice on how to approach this with him please?

Thank you all in advance!"

**How is HIV transmitted:**

Perinatal transmission — it is a hereditary transmission from a mother can transmit [HIV](https://jacobspublishers.com/jacobs-journal-of-aids-hiv/) to her child during childbirth, pregnancy, and also it is through breastfeeding. 

Blood transmission —it is a risk of transmitting HIV through blood transfusion is extremely low in developed countries. However, among people who inject drugs, sharing and reusing syringes contaminated with HIV-infected blood is an extremely hazardous common way of transmission. 

Sexual transmission — this transmission can happen when there is contact with infected sexual fluids like rectal, genital, and oral mucous membranes of the affected person. It can happen while having sex without a condom, including vaginal, oral, and anal sex. The sharing sex toys with someone who is HIV-positive Also transfer the virus.

**Symptoms**

Next, coming to the symptoms of HIV infection. The result of infections caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites. These reasons do not normally develop in individuals with healthy immune systems, which is protect the body against infection. The early symptoms of HIV infection are identifying generally. Most of the people with HIV infection have no symptoms until several months and even years after contracting the virus in the body. Moreover, around 80 percent may develop symptoms similar to flu for 2–6 weeks after catching this virus-This is called acute retroviral syndrome. 

The symptoms of early HIV infection may include: 

&amp;#x200B;

* joint      pain
* muscle      aches
* a sore throat
* sweats      (particularly at night)
* enlarged      glands
* a      red rash
* tiredness
* weakness
* unintentional      weight loss
* fever
* thrush
* fever      chills

This is important to kept mind that these symptoms appear when the body is fighting off many types of viruses or not just HIV virus. If you have some of these symptoms in your body. Then believe that you could have been at risk of contracting HIV in the last few weeks, you can take a test immediately."

Three days later I got my results back from the health department and everything came back negative. Still not sure I got a quaquick home test kit two weeks later and that test came back negative as well. And now just this week I’ve developed flu like symptoms and now I’m really worried.

I am a heterosexual male.

My test came back negative for HIV but that was the standard 4th gen which i understand takes months to be reactive if the virus is present. A few days after my diagnosis. I went to a cafe to get some work done. On my way there i began to feel nauseous. I feel hot and cold at the same time.  I ignore it and continue to go. Already stressed out about my HSV2 diagnosis i end up not getting any work done whatsoever and from the morning all the way to the night time i google shit about HIV and symptoms. I am extreme hypochondriac which i believe has developed into a full blown illness anxiety disorder.

Continuing, i couldn't eat and then could barely finish my one coffee for 9-10 hours. I go to the pharmacy to pick up my Lexapro for anxiety and depression that my doctor had just prescribed me. I feel so week that i feel like im going to pass out. Im like leaning over the pharmacy desk trying to get my shit together, and cant so i go sit down for 5 mins before i can talk to the lady. 

Literally feel like my soul is leaving my damn body. But not in the good way. I walk home and try and get something to put on my stomach but could barely eat it without wanting to throw up. By the time i get home i could barely move my body. It felt like my arms were 1000's of pounds. I was super hot, nauseous to the point where even water was making me sick, and i literally couldn't sleep. Very intrusive thoughts for the rest of the night.  

It took me a few days to began eating somewhat normally again. The apathy and intrusive thoughts were so in control for weeks that i felt like i was just not even myself and moving without a purpose. I ordered an RNA test from my doc about 15 days after exposure which ended up coming back negative. 

I have done some research on the effects that anxiety can have on your body and im considering that too.

Here and there i still feel moments of nausea and fatigue, and i find that i don't handle cold weather nearly as well as i did last year. 

I am also considering that this could be prodrome responses due to an on coming herpes outbreak. But my symptoms for herpes seem to never go away. Always itching to some degree or feeling some type of tingling and or burning sensation. I know that people with both HIV and herpes are more prone to herpes outbreaks.

So a few questions:

- Can anyone educate me on the probability of false negative RNA tests ?

- Why aren't RNA tests done more than the 4th Gen tests? They can detect the actual virus so why isnt that a staple for testing over the 4th Gen?

- Has anybody had an experience like mine where their body just shut down? And how long did it take for you to recover?

Im think about getting tested again in 2 months.

In this time I have been having some weird symptoms - many of them are normal for me but when I put them all together it's really scaring me. Ill give a timeline of the symptoms I've been experiencing below;

1. straight after I had an itchy head, which I think came from putting box dye of clean hair but worth a mention.
2. Also within days to a week after I had eczema on my hands (normal for me, especially between my fingers), neck (I get this sometimes) and nipples (which was new for me but at the time I put it down to hot weather and rubbing against my bra). I usually get eczema as a stress reaction or hot/cold weather and have never had it on my lower body. The rashes were pretty mild, the last remnants of them remain now. These are the symptoms that scare me the most though as when I look on the internet this is where HIV rash normally shows up.
3. In the past few months, I have had minor colds and things like that but actually less severe than I have in other years.
4. The other day I looked in the mirror and my tongue was caked in yellow, it all brushed off leaving a white lining - most of which I can still get off but reappears between brushes. I looked back on some pictures though and two years ago I had a slight white lining on my mouth, it may be because of smoking cigarettes
5. Swollen tongue with scalloped sides - again could be a result of smoking, anxiety, and excessive drinking over the Christmas period.
6. Small ulcer/canker sore inside bottom lip - again this could be caused by smoking, stress, or the fact I put drugs in my mouth on NYE.
7. I have inspected my vagina several times at least in the last month and generally looks normal to me. 
8. When I checked ""downstairs"" this morning I have a skin tag around my anus which I'm sure is a haemorrhoid (had some blood when I poo and nighttime itching since before incident), and a bit of redness around my perineum but other than that looks/feels fine. 
9. Recently I have also had a decrease in appetite, this could purely be because I'm worrying myself sick though. 

I'm going to have to get tested anyway but I can't keep looking at Google and getting more and more anxious in the meantime.

We have a national online program and an in-person program for people who live in Chicago.

There will be follow-up surveys and free at-home STI testing before and after the 2GETHER program. Because we're a university, all data we collect is protected by IRB and federal regulations.

[For HIV, Prevention is Treatment: Blog URL](https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2019/01/22/for-hiv-treatment-is-prevention/)

Dodd's full comment: "" While PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) appears to be a worthwhile approach, a preventative vaccine remains an essential part of any solution. 

The challenges with PrEP include extremely high costs (&gt;$400,000 for lifetime treatment per patient), patient compliance, side effects, capturing undiagnosed patients, etc. PrEP alone will only slow the rate of new infections. it won’t stop or reverse these alarming trends. 

Funding for preventative vaccine clinical trials remains insufficient and it’s shameful that public policy leaders appear satisfied that HIV is now a chronic condition, one that can be simply managed via PrEP. 

Society and public health ought to demand greater focus on progress regarding demonstration of a safe and effective preventative vaccine for HIV."""

Anyways, 1-2 weeks later, swollen lymph node on my neck, very bad sore throat, lost a bit of weight, generally feeling unwell. 

2-4 weeks, having bad depression constantly and a lack of motivation like I've never had in my life, can't find joy in anything, feeling tired all the time, swollen lymph nodes still there.

4 weeks - now , had bouts of diarheea, not frequent, just a couple of days at the start of the month and some now, severe lack of motivation, memory and working memory problems (have problems finding the right words, being as sharp as I was), caught a very bad flu 3 days ago, sleeping ~12 hours a day since, the flu is starting to go away, attention problems, inflamed nodule is receding but still feel it, frequent night sweats that have a foul smell (sometimes related to something else directly, but not always)

I know you can't diagnose me but can you tell me how it looks? Having read about the mental aspect of the disease and how rats/humans started doing worse in cognition and memory tests after only a month of contracting the virus. The brain damage being irreversible only stopped from growing with treatment scares the shit out of me. Do I have it and will my memory be worse for life if I start treating it now at ~2 months. How come no one talks about the mental aspect this early? 

bonus story , about 6 weeks in -  after one night of no sleep, after a very stressful situation, I kind of fall asleep or faint in the snow, I remember very little from that night other than the fact that I thought I was going to sit on a bench but it was actually a visual distortion and I sat on snow and texted my gf a bunch of weird stuff. I did have some amphetamine the day before and that day but before that, I even had fake amphetamine that was very damaging and vasoconstricting, staying 2-3 nights up without anything close to what happened that night - 
The day after I actually thought that I had something more serious than HIV, because I felt like I couldn't remember faces and that my mind was very foggy. I'm usually a very clear headed person."

Eventually after 3 months I finally tested myself with a self testing kit I bought at the a local pharmacy and the results came out as negative.

My background in HIV includes a masters in public health with a focus on behavioral social and community health and 5 years of experience in HIV prevention and testing. 
I worked at a testing center for 3 years and now I run the HIV testing program for the clinic I work for.

Anxious about it. 

I’m going to go through the sexual experience as best I can. I (21M) suspect this lady (31F) can possibly have HIV. I’d rather not say why. Let’s just say that this lady was once my maid back I high school. And came across something that made me suspect. Came across some of her medication and it recall it being HIV medication. Could’ve been for someone else but who knows. I know she would get lots of medicines for other people, including my dad. (She’s from lives in Mexico). This was like 5 years ago. 

Last week she slid in my DMs and I set up a date. Told myself I would ask her if she’s clean before we had sex (if we ever got there). And it did. I did ask her. She said yes that’s she’s absolutely clean. Keep in mind I hadn’t nutted in like 2 weeks so at this point I was extremely horny and this lady once dominated my sexual fantasies for years. That’s why I was so liberal about this whole thing. But now that I’m post coital I’ve been freaking and realized that I’ve made a mistake and I’m scared.

Ok so here’s what we did. We held hands right for a while. We made out a good amount. We cuddled. We we got to my place, we continued making out. I undress her. And I eat her out for like 3-5 minutes or so. Before I do, I finger her. Now I had a paper cut on my index finger that was 3-4 days old. Not fresh. It’s possible I’ve used to finger to finger her. Not
Likely since I usually use the middle finger for that buts it’s POSSIBLE. Don’t remember.  Should mention she had lots of vaginal discharge when I ate her out. 

After I eat her out we make out more. I then put on a condom. And bang her missionary. I last a good couple minutes. I take off the condom then lay down and cuddle a bit. She left me two hickeys. One in front of my shoulder and another on my neck. I don’t think the were hard. Don’t think I was like bleeding or anything. Pretty sure I wasn’t but can’t be 100% sure. 

And that’s pretty much it. 

Let’s say she’s HIV positive. What are the chances that I contracted it? 

When should I get tested? 

When should I get symptoms?

I know I’m very dumb for going through with it. I was thinking with the wrong head. "

I went for my test and the doctor couldn't speak English but we did the test and left, the test was negative after 34 days after exposure and I will go back in 2 months. 

My question is the difference between these two tests. I was supposed to do the AG/AB Combo but I ended up doing the HIV Combi PT instead. 

I wanted to do the AG/AB because I have read that it was the best one to do after 28 days, I can't find any info on the HIV Combi PT test.

Do you think I should go back and ask them specifically to give me the AG/AB test?

Abstract

&gt;HIV-1 cure remains elusive with only one reported case a decade ago1,2. Termed the ‘Berlin patient’, the individual underwent two allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) procedures using a donor with a homozygous mutation in the HIV coreceptor CCR5 (CCR5Δ32/Δ32) to treat his acute myeloid leukaemia. Total body irradiation was given with each HSCT. Critically, it is unclear which treatment or patient parameters contributed to this only documented case of long-term HIV remission. Here we show that HIV-1 remission may be possible with a less aggressive and toxic approach. An HIV-1-infected adult underwent allo-HSCT for Hodgkin’s lymphoma using cells from a CCR5Δ32/Δ32 donor. He experienced mild gut graft versus host disease. Antiretroviral therapy was interrupted 16 months after transplantation. HIV-1 remission has been maintained through a further 18 months...

&amp;#x200B;

While this is a grand distance from being a universal cure or treatment, the ability to maintain remission in a second individual now is still a substantial step forwards. As the authors say, ""at 18 months post-treatment interruption it premature to conclude that this patient has been cured, these data suggest that single allo-HSCT with homozygous CCR5Δ32 donor cells may be sufficient to achieve HIV-1 remission with reduced intensity conditioning and no irradiation, and the findings further support the development of HIV remission strategies based on preventing CCR5 expression."""

I took the antibiotic he prescribed and two days later broke out in hives.  They said it was the antibiotic and game me another one plus steroids.  

After a week I needed a nap just to go to the bathroom.  I finally drove myself to the Emergency Room and crashed immediately.  They kept me in the ER all day to watch me then put me ICU for 4 days, then a regular room.

Every day, they took blood.  I assume they run tests on it.  Nobody ever mentioned HIV.  I get out of the hospital, finish the meds and a month later get my blood drawn for my annual physical.  My doc is gay and always includes HIV in my blood tests even though I tested every 3 months.  It came back as ""indeterminate"". 

What I don't understand is why the hospital didn't determine that I had HIV.  Don't they include that in every patient's blood tests?  When I look back at the events, I'm pretty sure the ""prostrate infection"" was really HIV. But I don't understand why a hospital wouldn't have picked up on that.

Three years later, I finally started getting recurrent fevers and diahorrea once in a while, and I went to get my status checked. My CD4 was 245 and I had a VL of 100k. Been on meds since, and I feel loads fucking better. But I feel cheated. I feel like I let my folks down. And don't tell me it's not a death sentence in India, because it is. We don't even have half the medicines you guys keep talking about  on the group. There are limited options and we follow WHO guidelines for medication as a developing country. I lost a poz friend a week ago to a heart attack at the age of 30. 
And everytime I'm with my family and I see them laughing and been proud of me, it just breaks my heart into a million pieces. I don't know what it's going to be like for them when I kick the bucket. My dad thinks I should be a role model for the LGBT community in India but he has no clue. Sometimes they discuss my marriage, my mother wants me to buy a new apartment and I really don't know how long do I have with me to really fulfill their wishes. I can't tell them because it'll make them sad and life has only gotten better for them now. I'm trying to get through life with a smile but It's frustrating, HIV is so much more than just a virus. It's so fucking much more.

We can't let a damn virus define ourselves. Even of we get rejected by mindless hook up apps,even if people think they are in danger by being close to us,even if the world refuses to accept that it's not a mortal condition,even if the world falls to pieces: do not give up.
I for one will be here in reddit,there on the streets,in the support office,in your reddit feed to remind you that,not just me but everyone,is here to listen and know that you are not alone.
I had been feeling really awful these days and I see there is no point in being sad about a mistake that was partially mine,because it was my responsibility as well to keep myself safe. It's also my responsibility to go forward and not let this thing define me. I refuse to be just a statistic of ""yet another gay positive person"",I know I can be a lot more and I can also get through the storm of feeling sad about hiv and my status.
I also want everyone here to be able to go above their status and be the best of themselves they can be. I want to say I love you all,and that I'm happy that you are always in standby to help and answer questions. I want to say thank you and I love you,even though we never met,we might possibly meet one day and hopefully that day hiv is just a trivial thing we have and we can laugh at.
Love you all."

I found that many patients were particularly concerned about the exact causes of their cancer and wondered whether the same causes could provoke the development of another cancer or could provoke a similar cancer for the people around them. Obviously, this includes HIV.  So I decided to create an app to adress those concerns!

The aim of the application I have developed is estimating the risk of cancer for any individual based on all the risk factors that can be found in the scientific literature. It includes 250 different risk factors and can calculate the risk for 26 different cancers. It also gives you a breakdown of each of those risks by showing you all the risk factors influencing it (both positive and negative) with detailed figures, possible lifestyle changes one could make and references. It is completely free and does not transmit any medical information to us or any other party.

The app is called 'Cancer Risk Calculator' and is available for both Android and Apple devices. If any of you would like to see the effects of your condition on your risk of cancer, please feel free to try it."

I had tried a lot of things to get rid of my supposed folliculitus. I eventually saw a dermatologist how asked the same question and no it was not on my lips or genitals. I went on antibiotics and the symptoms subsided so I decided to date again and ended up sleeping with two girls. 

Two months after the second girl I stated to get what seemed like the symptoms of herpes on my lips and nose, they had turned red and I had some pain on my nose after a bad bought of the flew. The eventually turned into tingling red bumps on my lips and skin peeling. I thought it was maybe  a result of shedding. Went and got tested for HSV HIV and Syphilis at planned parenthood. And once again they tried to dismiss it as minor but I got tested anyway 5 months after I slept with the last girl. Test came back positive for HSV-1 only. 

So I got on valtrex  1000 mg twice for a 5 day outbreak treatment. It only worked while I was on it. Went back and got Valacyclovir a 500 mg twice every twelve hours. And it was still not completely gone because my scalp was still very itchy and I had alot of dandruff. I'm now realizing that I have Seborrheic dermatitis even my hands are peeling and skin is falling off constantly. I may also have trush but I only notice it when I drink milk and my tongue is cover in white mucus. At first I thought these were side effect of the antivirals and harsh chemicals I was using to stop the red marks and such. I also had a couple ulcers near my lips in my mouth that were minor. 

I know these are tell tail signs of an HIV infection. My question is, could the HSV antibodies confuse the test and give me a negative HIV test? It was plenty of time for HIV to come out in blood work 5 months after having unprotected sex.

I have herpes and had a live podcast recording at an event and had to check someone who misspoke about HIV and let them know about U=U and I felt so confident doing so. Someone thanked me and it felt good to just know this info.

Anyways, reaching out because this latest episode of the podcast could use some feedback. As members of the hivaids subreddit, I hope to get a handful of people to advise me on this interview to let me know if I am going about this correctly and doing all I can to positively shift stigma around HIV. 

I interview a nonprofit in my hometown that provides resources to people who are HIV/AIDS+. St. Louis Effort for AIDS is the organization, and I interviewed the VP of Operations about their services. I got tested for HIV and syphilis, ghonnorea and chlamydia as well. The experience was fantastic.

So to make sure my approach is welcomed by the community, I ask that you listen (and leave a review if you want this to get out to more people) and let me know what you like about this and what could be better.

The episode is #75 of Something Positive for Positive People and can be found on any podcast player, Google search, or this link: [https://somethingpositiveforpositivepeople.podbean.com/e/episode-75-safe-spaces-to-get-involved-st-louis-effort-for-aids/](https://somethingpositiveforpositivepeople.podbean.com/e/episode-75-safe-spaces-to-get-involved-st-louis-effort-for-aids/)

I apologise in advance if I am in the wrong place - if I am I would be very grateful if you could direct me to the right place.

I won't use their real names I just need some advice on how I can help my friends.

Sam(M26) who I've known for 15 years is a very close friend of mine, he's like a brother who has supported me throughout our whole friendship he is just wonderful; Sam got into an exclusive relationship in November 2018 and yesterday his partner (JoshM 26) was confirmed HIV +tive. They have been to a specialist HIV clinic today for Josh to discuss his options and staging of the virus - I'm not sure of the outcome of that appointment yet.

Understandably Sam is very anxious that he might be +tive and is waiting for his bloods to come back. Sam suffers with depression and anxiety which he has been working very hard to control however I am very concerned about his mental health especially as he will be supporting Josh through this. I've asked him that when he finds the energy to think of things that his friends can do to help him if he feels he needs extra support. 
I would like to try and help him make a sort of action plan to help him find out his triggers and things we can put in place to de-escalate his anxiety and low mood if he starts to feel poorly. Has anyone tried this before? If so did you find it helpful and do you have a template or any ideas to help me create one?

I wanted to ask if anyone can direct me towards some accurate education material - I am a member of the medical community but G.U.M isn't my specialty, I have access to materials I just want to make sure I read the most helpful things, does anyone have any suggestions? 

I want to make sure I am fully capable of supporting Sam and Josh through this and I believe if I have educated myself well and can help them with their mental health on a personal level then I can provide them with a good support and whoever else they decide to include. 

I'm absolutely not going to insert myself into their situation and just assume they want me around, I am taking it day by day and they are fully in control of what they want and who they want.  I have offered my reassurance and anything that they need to just ask me but if they do decide to continue to involve me I would like to be a positive and proactive support.

I would be so grateful if anyone could help me to find ways of supporting them and if during your diagnosis or loved ones diagnosis what you found particularly helpful. I realise everyone is different and an individual but I'm certain that reflecting with anyone in this situation will be very beneficial.

Thank you so much for your time x"

Also important to mention that I haven’t had sex in nearly two years and was in the hospital for various unrelated reasons those two years so I would think it would have shown up on any of those blood tests, right?

Is it possible the blood test is wrong? I’ve been crying all night over this. I just don’t know how it’s possible. Any insight would be appreciated as I’m about to have a nervous breakdown.

Thank you."

I know these test are extremely accurate but is there anyway I can get two negative tests? 
Test were at two different clinics and possible exposure was around the 27 of March. Once again I’m sorry if this is not what you want to see in this forum but I need good opinions. I’m getting a RNA blood test down next week Friday as well to be a 100% clear. Thank you so much for your patience with me."

Hello r/hivaids members!

Our team from the University of Texas at Austin is conducting a study on HIV-related stigma experienced by gay and bisexual men who are dating and living with HIV.

We're currently looking for people to participate in our study by filling out a few short surveys. All participants will be entered to win one of 20 $20 gift cards, and will receive additional entries to the drawing if they refer others to the study (email addresses will be stored in a database separate from the survey responses, so your email address won't be connected to your answers).

We would like to invite folks to participate in this study if they:

\-Identify as a man, are 18 or over, and live in the U.S.

\-Have used online apps, such as Grindr or Scruff, to seek out romantic, sexual, or friendship interactions within the past year.

\-Have been diagnosed with HIV.

Participation in this study will involve completing a set of surveys online and will take 10-20 minutes.

This study has been approved by the University of Texas at Austin IRB 2018-04-0085.

Please click the link below if you wish to take part in the survey.

Basically for the last 2 weeks I have been suffering with dizziness and some nausea, it picked up on Monday and basically hand some heart palpitations and went home from work. 

New symptoms: cold feeling to my feet and sometimes hands, strange stomach noises and I also have had increased tinnitus.

Also feeling of anxiety. 

No signs of vomiting or fever over the last 2 weeks. Also I don't really feel fatigued just stressed. 

I have been to my doctor and explained my symptoms etc and they did not raise red flags to her. 

This all picked up since I got back from a trip to Las Vegas, however I have not had any unprotected anal sex with anyone and only oral unprotected.

Anyone else had any similarities to myself in terms of symptoms?

Im planning to see my doctor on Tuesday as I do feel like symptoms are worse."

I'll still get tested (unless you guys tell me I don't have to), but I just want to know in how much danger I am. I read an article that mentioned that HIV is not easily transmitted from wounds that have started to heal and are not open, or from surface scratches. Is there a chance I could have contracted aids?

Abstract

Strategies to cure HIV-infected patients by virus-targeting drugs have failed to date. We identified a HIV-1-seropositive woman who spontaneously suppressed HIV replication and had normal CD4-cell counts, no HIV disease, no replication-competent virus and no cell HIV DNA detected with a routine assay. We suspected that dramatic HIV DNA degradation occurred postinfection. We performed multiple nested-PCRs followed by Sanger sequencing and applied a multiplex-PCR approach. Furthermore, we implemented a new technique based on two hybridization steps on beads prior to next-generation sequencing that removed human DNA then retrieved integrated HIV sequences with HIV-specific probes. We assembled ≈45% of the HIV genome and further analyzed the G-to-A mutations putatively generated by cellular APOBEC3 enzymes that can change tryptophan codons into stop codons. We found more G-to-A mutations in the HIV DNA from the woman than in that of her contaminator. Moreover, 74% of the tryptophan codons were changed to stop codons (25%) or were deleted as a possible consequence of gene inactivation. Finally, we found that this woman cells remained HIV-susceptible in vitro. Our findings show that she does not exhibit innate HIV resistance but has been cured of it by extrinsic factors, a plausible candidate for which is the gut microbiota."

First of all I'm really sorry if this questions gets asked too often and you are bothered by it. It's just that I couldnt find any answer by doing research online.

So, 3 weeks ago I gave a blowjob. My tooth was broken and it was kind of sharp. That made my tongue have a sore (that didn't bleed) but it also made my partner bleed a bit from his penis. He didn't cum in my mouth. But when we were done I spitted some blood in the sink (it was really not a lot).

So I know in general oral sex is not very dangerous, and I also know that having mouth sores increase the risk of infection. Im just wondering, is it very risky what happened to me? How likely I am to have HIV?

Thank you very much. And also, English is not my native language.

Thanks very much."

Cd4, latency, how the meds work, etc.  What I don’t get are the social aspects of the virus, the way we respond to it and the way we allow ourselves to think about it and by extension ourselves.

I don’t understand how anyone can read an account from a young man who has spent his adult life in practical celibacy after being infected at 15 and think “What we need to do is advocate PrEP, so that 34 year old used car salesmen in Columbus can brag about taking loads *and* being **clean** on his scruff profile”.  

I don’t understand how someone can say the same previous account is a good example of why we need a sterilizing cure and get *downvoted*.  WTF?!?  If the point of a cure isn’t to release us from this hell, why should we even bother?

Speaking of a cure, I generally don’t understand the lack of passion and advocacy for a cure.  I’m baffled by these so-called “activists” who fall all over themselves to let us know that we “already have the tools to end AIDS”.  End aids for whom?  We don’t have the tools to end HIV for me or any of the other 30+ million people already living with the virus.  What they really mean is “We have to tools to protect ourselves, *The Clean*, and fuck off to everyone else”.  I don’t know how we can see that and not start frothing at the mouth.

Speaking of frothing at the mouth, I don’t know why it’s viewed so harshly.  We should all be frothing at the mouth.  The US currently has more aids deaths than it had through much of the 80s.  We have a worsening criminalization problem.  We have a stigma situation that in many ways appears to be backsliding.  We have an entrenched and growing double standard in sexuality, where Poz people are deemed sluts who deserve aids for having barebacked, even if we were raped.  Meanwhile negative people are deemed as deserving endless resources and help for when they bareback, “because nobody deserves HIV”.  Well, except for those of us who have it apparently.

Speaking of endless resources, the US has just declared that[PrEP must be available to all](https://www.thebodypro.com/article/government-panel-finds-prep-is-effective-must-be-available-free-of-cost-to?ap=2009), with “no cost sharing”.  This apparently means no copays, no lab fees, no doctor’s bills.  As I understand it, this also means that there may be no restrictions on the types of medicines used as PrEP.  Meanwhile, [yet another pharmacy group has placed still more restrictions on available HIV treatments.](https://www.thebodypro.com/article/hiv-advocacy-group-spars-with-express-scripts-over-drug-formulary-changes?ap=2009). This comes in addition to ongoing differences in the types of pharmacies people with HIV are allowed to use vs PrEP users.  In addition to the onerous growth of copay accumulators that force us to maximize our out of  pocket cost.  And I can personally assure you all that when you earn your way out of Ryan White, you’ll be paying for all your labs and doctors costs, unlike PrEP users.  In other words, we are now receiving much worse care and paying much more for the same drugs and services than the HIV negative.  This is only happening because we happen to have the virus.  I don’t know why we’re not all frothing at the mouth.  

I don’t understand any of this shit, and I don’t want to hear any rationalizations anymore.  I’ve pointed out that these things are bullshit for my entire fucking nine years with HIV, and at every stage I’ve hand had someone explain it to me like it was fair, just, sensible or unavoidable.  I don’t understand the defeatism of HIV.  But what I do understand is that if anything is going to change, we need to stop tolerating this defeatism."

Let me start by saying that I firmly believed that I had HIV testing right before entering a 3 year relationship with my current boyfriend (apparently I hadn't and it's a long story) after finding out I never had actually been tested I started freaking out. I didn't want anything bad to happen. I went to CVS and picked up one of those at home HIV tests. I was way past the window period and it came out HIV negative. I have intense anxiety and still didn't want to give my current partner anything so I went to the walk in clinic to get a test. The doctor looked at me and told me the statistics of me being a white, heterosexual women's chance of being HIV positive. Annoyed and defeated I left. I was very uneducated about STD's in general and had no idea where to get testing for free. The fear ate at me until I wound up taking a human sexuality class. She taught us where to get tested and I was so happy. I went to the health department and got a blood test, free of charge. I waited anxiously for my results and basically convinced myself that I had HIV and convinced myself that my life, as I knew it, would end. However, when I started doing research on HIV I realized that my whole fear was that of the stigma not the actual infection. As I researched medications and treatments I started to realize that HIV wasn't a death sentence and it is no different than any other autoimmune disease. My test results came back HIV negative but I gained so much knowledge out of the experience. I shared this so I can share how I was stigmatized by HIV until I did my research and realized it isn't anything different than cancer or rheumatoid arthritis. For those of you living with HIV, I hope the world can gain a better understanding in the future and that I can give knowledge to those who do not actually know. And for those who don't know their status because of the fear, get tested, there is nothing to fear."

So I got a fever last Saturday and my symptoms included sweating, chills, joint pain, and fatigue. On Sunday it remained the same, but yesterday and today I no longer have chills, joint pain and fatigue, but I still have a fever and headaches and just now I notice that I have a rash on my chest and underneath where my bra area is at. I went to the Doctor to confirm that the rash is from either fifth or sixth disease. The rash lasted for about two days; however I notice that I have these small bumps that all sudden appear underneath my breasts. They don’t itch and haven’t appear red 

So that was last week and since then I the symptoms haven’t came back; however, because I’m a hypochondriac I’m under a lot of stress and I frequently worried that I have HIV despite the fact that I took the test last week (which was three weeks since my last sexual encounter) I took the p24 test and it came back negative. Regardless of the results, should I get tested again just to make sure? Would HIV been detected during the three week that I was sick?

I'm not sure what my cd4 counts are or what they were when I was diagnosed, but my doctor said upon my diagnosis that based on my numbers I was likely infected years ago. If I had to trace it back, I would say possibly between 2013 and 2015. One thing that has concerned me greatly is when I started reading about opportunistic infections.

What prompted getting tested was when I was being treated for non-hodgkins lymphoma. I was admitted to the hospital for pneumonia, which was what prompted the tests. My doctors confirmed that it was related to HIV. I also noticed I had developed oral thrush a short time later and in May was diagnosed with shingles in addition to having chronic night sweats. I have read that the lymphoma and everything I mentioned were signs that my HIV had reached the final stage and become aids. To know for sure I'm sure I would need to know my cd4 count but I was wondering if anyone can confirm what I've read.

In January I started taking biktarvy but unfortunately as of two weeks ago my insurance ran out and have not been able to refill my prescription, which worries me if my HIV has advanced the where I believe it has. I've noticed recently that I've been developing blotches on my nose/forehead and arms. I have my doctors appointment in about a week so I'm hoping to get these questions answered 100%"

That night, I noticed small blisters in my genitals, so I went to the youth clinic and told them about my symptoms and the blisters. They took some STI tests including HIV. 

A week later I got diagnosed with GHSV2 from the swab test. Everything else were negative.

I went back a week later to get another HIV test,
2 weeks later the results came in and it was again negative.

It’s been 4 weeks since my last HIV test, I’m getting another HIV test this monday for my PREP. I’m afraid what if it comes out positive this time? I’m so scared

I’ve never had any swollen lymph nodes or any skin rashes. I only had Fever, soar throat and blisters in my genitals. When I got diagnosed with Herpes, I didn’t feel like myself. I was also stressed out the same time because with all the research I’ve done, I kept teling myself what if I also caught HIV? I became really stressed out and my anxiety was kicking in. One night after doing more research, I was having nightsweats, woke up every hour until about 6 in the morning. I had nightsweats the following few days. My feet were also cold during those days.

Were those nightsweats caused by my stress and overthinking? or maybe I have HIV? 

——
My first HIV test was a few days after having the symptoms. - Negative

My second test was 2 weeks after the symptoms. - Negative"

Like many of you, I am HIV+. But I have a really hard time getting blood drawn, in fact moreso than the average “needle-phobe”. I do everything I can to be calm, relaxed, and chilled out the day of the needle. I am very nit picky and do my best to eat an extremely healthy diet within the 48 hours before, I make sure to drink at least a gallon per day of slightly saline water, and I do my best to get in 6-8 hours of sleep every night. I exercise about every other day and I try to give myself a “rest day” the day of the blood draw.

No matter how I prepare or get ready for it, I ALWAYS “faint” in the middle of the first vial of blood. My heart stops for this so the blood doesn’t keep going for the vial (this always frustrates the nurse) and I go into these traumatizing convulsions (if I’m lucky the nurse has pulled out the needle for this part).

Every time I go to the doctor it gets worse. Last visit, I went into convulsive syncope multiple times. I was actually so sore and weak I could barely get up out of bed or walk for the next two days. It’s fucking surreal to go through. Even fucking scarier though, I barely got out of that hospital’s parking lot when I fainted *in the driver’s seat*! I couldn’t believe myself when I woke up, and there I was on the road inching forward bit by bit with a long line of cars waiting behind me (I don’t remember if they were honking at me or anything, I just pulled myself into the next parking lot and laid down some more in the backseat).

I don’t know if I can do this anymore. Every day is scarier and scarier. I’m at my limit for these occurrences. Of all things, I’m going to die from fucking fainting in the wrong place. Last month, I fell down and fainted in the parking lot of the grocery store getting out of my car. If I don’t kill someone because I fainted driving in the car, I’m going to get killed the next time I faint behind someone’s fucking Escalade in another parking lot. I can’t take waking up discovering all these problems fucking blood drawing shit making it so much worse! 

Doctors won’t give me a direct answer, they just say it’ll get better, relax, but IT DOESNT!! It just get WORSE!! It FUCKING SUCKS!!! If I could just stay awake for the fucking blood draw I wouldn’t have any of the problems from the seizures that come with it. At this point, I can’t even get the tests done. I’m out of my old meds.

The participants, most of whom were African American and receiving HIV antiretroviral therapy, were followed up for a total of 7 months and encouraged to adhere to their allocated treatment for four months.

At the start of the trial all the women met criteria for unhealthy alcohol use, 62% met criteria for an alcohol use disorder, and only 63% had HIV viral suppression. Women in both groups substantially reduced their drinking over the course of the study; only around half of participants reported ongoing unhealthy alcohol use at four months, and this proportion continued to drop even after stopping the medication. Although women taking naltrexone initally showed a greater reduction in drinking than those assigned to placebo, there was no difference between the two groups from four months onwards; at seven months, 64% of women in each group had reduced or quit drinking.

[Laboratory analysis showed that HIV viral suppression was significantly](https://www.newswise.com/articles/study-participation-cuts-alcohol-use-and-boosts-viral-suppression-in-female-drinkers-with-hiv) more common among women who had reduced or quit drinking than in those who continued to drink at unhealthy levels; after 7 months, 74% of those who had reduced or quit drinking had HIV viral suppression, compared with 54% of those who had not cut their alcohol intake.

It has recently come to my attention that a former sexual partner of mine had HIV during our encounter together. 

They had been undetectable for years before the encounter, and we used protection. The risk of transmission was low to nonexistent. 

I live in a state where not disclosing HIV status is criminalized under the law, regardless of the risk of transmission. Informed consent is required, otherwise the HIV positive person can be prosecuted. 

Should I pursue criminal charges against the HIV positive person who did not tell me of their status, or should I let it go considering the risk of transmission was zero and they took their own measures to prevent transmission?

I should mention that this person is now running for local political office. I’m conflicted on whether to step forward and make this public while possibly pressing charges, or letting him be since transmission risk was zero.

I’ve tested negative recently. The encounter with him was over a year ago. It is likely he did the same to at least a few other men. 

Also, I was the top and he was the bottom."

And if I change all my attitudes and behaviors to reflect utmost self care and dignity (apart of self care is affording the same care and dignity to others) that the biomarker HIV may still be present, but it won't affect my health, and it won't be able to pass on to other people (because I will have an auto immune system so strong that it will literally not be able to hurt another person, it will be in a state of peace not war...because another person is simply an extension of me, and i of them, we are of the same weaving of source... and therefore they are protected from myself...IF I am in sufficient practice of attitudes of utter acceptance, abundance of physical resources, and not feeling afraid of potential suffering...(total faith).

I've been reading on virusmyth.com and many respected scientists and doctors are quoted saying they believe there's no proof that HIV is in fact a virus and it was due to fear of defining and understanding this biomarker that is was termed a ""virus"".

I've been almost bedridden for 10 months and my t cells are dropping and around 400 i think, but my viral load is still in the ""low"" section. I may be in denial that a physical entity is causing me to feel ill but also it's my spiritual belief that nothing can cause me suffering or degeneration unless I allow it to. My theory is that with fresh food, herbs, belonging in a community, and actively working to heal the planet and other people, that I will have all I need for my body to regenerate itself and the biomarker of HIV (warning sign that healing is now Vital) will go down in copies, maybe disappear completely, or simply have no effect on anyone yet just be present in my DNA as a testament to the history of my experience.

Apart of my theory is due to my first HIV doctor at a prestigious hospital, telling me that I was an ""elite controller"" of HIV and he believed I could go my whole life without meds and would be in good health. We also related over LSD experiences which led me to believe there is a common thread of certain attitudes that allow  understanding HIV in a different light. I was in excellent health and my HIV only began affecting me after I made bad life choices due to unresolved childhood trauma and beliefs, and was homeless, anorexic, addicted, in an abusive relationship, publocally shamed, traveling way too much, and reached psychosis point. So I believe my current state of health is due to a culmination of these factors rather than HIV itself damaging my body. HIV is rather what I have gratitude for, for being a physical culturally unignorable sign that my healing is vital.

There is a Dr Sebi who was taken to court for claiming he could cure aids, cancer etc and many people came to defend him that they were in fact cured (like over 50 people, can't recall the exact number).

Yet also I consider if I just resist meds out of paranoia and confusion residual from psychosis, and am afraid that I may be misunderstanding HIV and am just killing myself. I wonder if my desire to be an experiment in curing HIV is more from a fear that I am not valuable to the world in any other way, and that by sticking steadfast to my belief I shall be successful.

I appreciate to hear perspectives of why I may or may not be correct in pursuing this mission. And if you have experience in curing your HIV without drugs please share. 

I'm worried that HIV drugs are too new and experimental in relation to Human history and that they will have harmful effects to my body, and harm my ability to feel god and feel sacred..like it will alter the channel I'm tuned into and I won't remember who I am."

1. What is it like to date as an HIV positive person?
2. How has being HIV positive affected your outlook on life?
3. What are some myths about HIV that you wish people were better educated about?
4. What's the hardest part about living with HIV?  


We're also looking to have a short 10-15 minute phone call with someone living with HIV in order to get a better understanding of how being HIV positive affected your life. This can be totally anonymous if you would prefer (just comment or dm, or email us at [hashtaghealthpodcast@gmail.com](mailto:hashtaghealthpodcast@gmail.com) if you would be willing to help!)

[Pushing to require Prior Authorization for HIV Medications.](https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/425850-trumps-medicare-rule-change-threatens-to-reignite-aids-epidemic?amp). As of 5/19/19 Medicare declined this option.

My ear is sensitive still and I started bleeding quite a lot from trying on the piercing. I told the people working and they said they wipe them with rubbing alcohol and not to worry.
I called a nurse line to make sure. This led to a doctors appt where my APRN said I was fine and not to worry but then called me a day later claiming I can decide to go on PEP. I went to the pharmacy and I was only prescribed Truvada and the pharmacists claimed my insurance won’t approve it and that they both think I definitely need to take it.
Well I went to an HIV clinic instead and talked to a nurse there and they told me that I’m at 0 risk for HIV and to avoid PEP. I then got a call from my clinic who told me an infectious disease specialist had been called by them and said I’m not at risk. But the nurses still claimed I could have been exposed and may need PEP. I called the pharmacy about this and they told me there is a slight risk. Now it’s 50 hours and my prescription still isn’t correct and not ready. Does anyone have advice on this? Thank you so much."

Me being on his insurance, makes it so that I am ineligible for government insurance (medicaid or medicare I forget what its called).

 &gt; [Y]oung gay men experience HIV as *dystonic*— unexpected and foreign to their lives.  Because it is dystonic, young men typically shun HIV, and men under the age of thirty-five are much more likely than [older gay] men to express discomfort about relationships or sex with someone who is HIV-positive.  Seventy-nine percent of young men are “very or somewhat uncomfortable” with a long-term sexual relationship with an HIV-positive man; 89 percent feel similarly about casual sex with such a man.  What about a *nonsexual friendship* with a positive man?  Fully *40 percent* in this group describe themselves as very or somewhat uncomfortable with that possibility.  Younger men are— consciously— both unfamiliar with HIV and, by self-report, highly avoidant of it.  In contrast to this stated avoidance of HIV, 58 percent of HIV-negative younger-group men also reported unprotected anal intercourse in the twelve months prior to a CDC survey.  HIV testing levels are also low in this group and, as a result, so is proper early treatment of infection.  The CDC reports that 24 percent of otherwise healthy twenty-five to twenty-nine-year-olds process from first diagnosis of HIV infection to clinical AIDS within twelve months.

Odets goes on to quote a 27-year-old HIV-negative gay man living in San Francisco in 2014, who describes the life of his HIV-positive friend Noah (about the same age):

&gt; He’s in pretty bad shape really—I don’t mean physically—because when you get HIV, that’s pretty much the end of your social life, especially sex.  Guys that we both know—I’ll be someplace with Noah, and they act like he isn’t there, they completely ignore him and talk to me.  It’s embarrassing, and I feel bad for him.  I’d bet he hasn’t had sex since he got it.  I see this all the time when I’m out with him, and it pisses me off.  It’s made me a lot more worried about getting it because I don’t want a life like that.  Once when I asked him about people ignoring him, he said, “It’s like turning forty—no one’s interested in you.”  People are sometimes really hostile to him—say things to him directly— and tell hm he was stupid and got what he deserved, and that kind of thing, and you know they’re doing the same things he used to do.  He closed his Grindr account because when he would tell people he was positive, he’d get all kinds of crap.  It’s that racist thing, and I think a lot of these guys think they wouldn’t be interested in anyone who was the type who would get HIV and therefore they won’t get it.  I used to have sex with much older guys—you know, in their forties or so—but I’ve stopped because I know a lot of them have HIV and I don’t trust them to be honest.  I think getting HIV is probably the worst thing that could happen to me.  I'm not worried about getting sick because I know that doesn’t happen anymore, but I’d definitely never have a boyfriend for the rest of my life.

*Unbelievable*."

I couldn't believe it due to all the symptoms I've been experiencing. I still chose to abstain from sex in fear I would infect others. I would go in every week for test and they all kept coming back negative. I'm a living testament that HIV can take much longer than what the CDC claims for test to be conclusive results.

Just a general question that I'm kicking myself in the foot for doing.

I was really drunk the other night and decided to head down to a prostitution place to you know. It was my first time and at the time thought it would be funny. I'm a 19(M) and before you know it were having sex. Condoms were used but I'm just extremely paranoid by the fact that this prostitute COULD have HIV. I feel tingly and will get a test but read that it's best to wait 4 weeks. What are the chances I could have contracted HIV and what are the early symptoms I should look out for?

About 4 weeks ago I had a drunken hook up, I am a female btw and oral sex was performed on me. There was no sex, let alone unprotected sex, I stopped it all pretty quickly and left as soon as I came to my senses. I don’t remember if I had a cut but at one point I remember it stung a little bit.. he wasn’t being aggressive or biting, just a tad uncomfortable. I don’t know too much about this man (he was lovely tho?!) and I am regretting it.

About ten days after this occurrence I became quite fatigue, muscle aches, chills and eventually 5 days later I had white pus all over my tonsils that was not going away with antibiotics!

I wasn’t getting better and developed a phlegmy cough - realised all my lymph nodes were swollen - groin, neck, underarms &amp; I was having light night sweats. My doctor ran a battery of tests and what came back was very elevated liver enzymes, high lymphocytes and positive for current mono / EBV. It seemed to explain why I have had zero appetite and a yucky white tongue, severely tired etc.

Now I’m a bit anxious as I’ve read that the mono test can also pick up on acute hiv infection!? I am freaking out and now thinking that this is a false positive. Please, any advice is appreciated."

Also, there is a quicker way to get a HIV result?

Sorry if I am a little bit paranoid about HIV but this guy has been lying to me. He infected me with HSV months ago and he has been lying and faking he accepts my disease when he knows it was him infecting me, I comfronted him recently (since I only found out recently he was my carrier due to some HSV medication in his bathroom) and he kept lying and saying it was probably me infecting him (details apart I know it wasnt me for a lot of reasons but also the fact he kept hiding his status until I comfronted him explains a lot).

I’ve realized that it’s better than just torturing myself since there are meds that can help me live a long and healthy life if it turns out I’m positive.

I’m a bisexual guy. I’m almost 20 years old. I’ve only had three sexual partners my whole life. I’ve never had neither vaginal nor anal sex, only oral with all three partners.

My first partner was my first girlfriend, we were 14 or 15 at the time, we both definitely hadn’t had any sexual partners prior to each other and were exploring for the first time. I mean, we were each other’s first kiss as well, much less sexual partners. So I’m pretty sure I can rule her out.

My second partner was this guy I met in December last year. We dated from January until the second half of March. We’ve had oral sex two, maximum three times during that period, with the last one being at the beginning of March, I’m sure it wasn’t later. I know I shouldn’t trust people, but I was his first boyfriend, he’s never really had anyone and I’m pretty positive he wasn’t lying and therefore was completely clean. There was this one time after oral sex that it hurt to pee in the morning, but it cleared up after like a day of drinking some juices and teas the doctor recommended. I went to the clinic straight away and had my bloodwork done and everything was fine. I had also went to the party like two night before, so maybe it was the combination of sweat and the wind that was blowing (since I was dancing by an open window) that maybe caused me to get a simple cold.

My third partner was my second boyfriend. I was with him for a month. The only sexual contact we had was me putting his penis in my mouth for like 30 seconds, a minute tops and that was it, he didn’t even ejaculate or nothing. I know he had one boyfriend before me, but that was it. I remember the exact date it happened, it was on June 11th.

I haven’t had any symptoms for god knows how long just until about ten days ago. I went to this place I usually go to to get a burrito, I ate one and realized halfway through that it was extremely spicy and that I probably should have gotten a drink to go with it. I finished it and like two hours later while eating some candy I realized my tongue started hurting. I got home and realized my tongue was covered in white coating (basically like thrush) and had like wart looking things in the center of it (6-7 tops) which I presume are irritated papulae, but I’m not sure. I haven’t really had any symptoms since besides getting like a mild fever for a day, but I took care of myself and it went away really fast, in less than a day even. I usually get sick during this period anyways and I’ve been preparing for my exams, so I haven’t really been eating and exercising well enough. Besides this, no swollen lymph nodes, muscle pain, fatigue, headaches, nausea and other stuff. Nevertheless, I’m just really scared I have HIV. I know you guys aren’t doctors, but what do you all think?"

d77qeu,Long-Acting Injectable Multi-Drug Implant Shows Promise for HIV Prevention and Treatment,https://www.reddit.com/r/hivaids/comments/d77qeu/longacting_injectable_multidrug_implant_shows/,durini_1,12,2019-09-21 00:58:46,16,/r/hivaids/comments/d77qeu/longacting_injectable_multidrug_implant_shows/,NaN,"A new [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12141-5) published today in *Nature Communications shows*  a promising alternative for those who have to take a daily pill  regimen. Targeting HIV treatment and prevention, researchers across  multiple departments at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  collaborated on a seven-year study in animals to make a better  injectable drug implant that can combine multiple drugs and is  ultra-long-acting, while also addressing many of the challenges faced  with current HIV treatment and prevention methods.

“There is no FDA-approved or marketed technology for long-acting  prevention of HIV, and we are the first to use this delivery method with  multiple antiretroviral drugs,” said Rahima Benhabbour, PhD, MSc, first  author of the study and assistant professor in the UNC\_NCSU Joint  Department of Biomedical Engineering. “To have an HIV prevention  treatment that consists of an injection once or twice a year would make  an incredible impact for patients.” She added, “This technology is not  only promising for HIV, but for any kind of condition that requires a  daily intake of medication. We’re talking about a safe, removable,  long-lasting injection that takes away the burden of adhering to a daily  medication regimen.”

Antiretroviral drugs are used in both prevention and treatment of  HIV, and multiple types are used in combination to counteract resistance  to any one antiretroviral drug. These drugs need to be taken  consistently every day. There are many obstacles that stand in the way  of adherence to these medication regimens. Benhabbour says this  especially applies to otherwise healthy people trying to prevent  infection.

“In sub-Saharan Africa where prevalence of HIV is highest,  accessibility to these medications can be difficult, and there is much  stigma associated with the virus,” Benhabbour said. “It is a very big  deal for someone who doesn’t have HIV to go out of their way to not only  access the drugs, but then associate themselves with HIV by taking a  pill every day.”

There’s also the factor of human error. Anyone who strives to take a  daily multivitamin can understand that some days the pill gets skipped,  or gets taken at a different time of day. But such small deviations can  make antiretroviral drugs less effective.

“Because one of the biggest difficulties associated with HIV  prevention is lack of adherence to drug treatment, we wanted to create a  drug delivery system that essentially solved this problem,” said senior  author J. Victor Garcia, PhD, professor of medicine at UNC School of  Medicine, director of the International Center for the Advancement of  Translational Science and member of the UNC Center for AIDS Research.

The injectable implant is comprised of three elements – an organic  solvent, a polymer, and the drug or drugs that need to be delivered. The  formulation results in a honey-like liquid that turns into a solid when  injected under the skin. This phase inversion happens when the solvent  diffuses into the body leaving behind the polymer and medication(s) –  the combination of which determines over what time period the  medication(s) will be released into the blood system.

In this study six antiretroviral drugs were tested, and all kept  their physical and chemical properties within the formulation and upon  release. All six were also released from the implant at effective levels  for a sustained amount of time ranging from one month to a year.

The injectable drug implant created by UNC’s research team is the  first to address several drawbacks to the current method of long-acting  drug delivery for HIV – namely the ability to remove it and quickly  eliminate the presence of residual drug(s) in the system.

“If a patient needs to withdraw from the treatment because they’ve  had a bad reaction to the drug(s), or maybe a woman has become pregnant,  our implant can be easily surgically removed,” said Martina Kovarova,  PhD, contributing author to the study and associate professor of  medicine at UNC SOM.

This is the first ever injectable implant for HIV that can be removed  as early as one week, or as late as months after the injection, and  have drug levels virtually eliminated from the system within one week.  If the implant does not need to be removed, it biodegrades into lactic  and glycolic acids, which are already found in the body and are easily  absorbed.

Summary: [Researchers isolate switch that kills inactive HIV](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-09-isolate-inactive-hiv.html)

&gt;Using genetic sequencing, University of California San Diego School of Medicine researchers have identified **a principal cellular player controlling HIV reproduction in immune cells which, when turned off or deleted, eliminates dormant HIV reservoirs.**

Scientific paper: [The Long Noncoding RNA HEAL Regulates HIV-1 Replication through Epigenetic Regulation of the HIV-1 Promoter](https://mbio.asm.org/content/10/5/e02016-19)

&gt;Here, we report the first genome-wide analysis of lncRNA expression in HIV-1-infected primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). We identified an lncRNA, which we named HIV-1-enhanced lncRNA (*HEAL*), that is conserved only in chimpanzees and rhesus monkeys, suggesting that it is a recently emerged gene. We found that *HEAL* regulates HIV-1 replication in microglia and T cells and does so by forming an RNA-protein complex with FUS RNA-binding protein, which is specifically enriched at the CDK2 promoter. *HEAL*\-FUS complex positively regulates HIV transcription by recruitment of histone acetyltransferase p300 to the HIV promoter. Moreover, *HEAL* expression is elevated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HIV-1-infected individuals. **Remarkably,** ***HEAL*** **silencing by RNAi or knockout by CRISPR-Cas9 in T cells and microglia prevents recrudescence of HIV-1 upon withdrawal of azidothymidine (AZT) treatment** ***in vitro***. Thus, our results suggest that *HEAL* plays a vital role in HIV/AIDS pathogenesis and could potentially be exploited as a therapeutic target."

Well I wanted to give everyone an update.

We hung out twice this week and I told her about my status. It was one of the most nerve wracking things I've ever done, and I couldn't have been more nervous or beat around the bush more, but she told me that after looking at my Facebook she had already figured it out, and she just wanted to talk to me about it first. She told me that my nervousness about telling her just made me seem more likeable and made me seem like a genuinely good guy so that was a huge win.

I'm not a very optimistic person but I have pretty high hopes that things are going to work out with her. Fingers crossed."

I'm curious how people feel about this law change. 

I posted about this previously in a very emotionally charged way which is unfair in discussing something like a law change. I'm willing to hear both sides."

Hello, I hope you can help, these days have really been hell for me and I hope I can get out of all this well.

I am a man and I had a vaginal and anal unprotected (both) encounter on August 24 of this year and for a little over a week I am really worried about having contracted HIV and I just started thinking that because I have experienced quite noticeable hair loss at the top of my head. I have read every day on the internet and there are cases that relate alopecia and HIV or even Syphilis.

I had an OralQuick test of gums on October 19 and it turned out negative. I know very well that these types of rapid tests look for antibodies but they may not be as accurate because the antibodies can take up to 3 months to appear.

So I have the following questions.

1. How reliable is this negative result?
2. Can hair loss really be associated with these diseases?
3. Would hair loss be a symptom that HIV antibodies have already been generated in my body? Therefore, should the OralQuick test have been positive if I were really HIV positive?

Help please, I am waiting for the results of a 4th generation blood test that, as I was told, is very reliable after week 4. I can no longer wait for this, I am dying."

I was too scared to get tested. I did get a urine sample but that was for gonorrhea and clamidia so I'm good on that. Basically somewhere in July that was the beginning but I think if I were infected it'd be somewhere around Feb or april. It started off with being super gassey (and it always had the same exact sulfur smell) then it went into diarrhea for a couple weeks maybe 1-2 a week. Then when I got sent to a different juvenile facility it was like every damn day for a solid month then I kinda figured it could be my new ssris , abilify and citilopram. It stopped for maybe a month I got off them maybe a little diarrhea then like later in the day it'd be solid its super weird and confusing. Then it just completely stopped. I've developed a weird sinus problem there's no mucus anymore at least it's just like one nasal is always blocked. Since it's been colder out it has improved alot though. I'm also getting very minor migraines though (almost unnoticeable) and recently every once in awhile I'll get diarrhea like today. So I don't know what to think. I quit taking my medications buespar and Geodon. I take em every once in awhile but I've been out of lock up since sep the 26th I don't know if some sort of withdrawals or something could be what's happening but by now if anything the medication surely has to be out of my system. So my bday is soon, I'm definitely gonna get tested then. My parents don't need to know at all ecspecially with all the shit I've put em through."

So my question is if I recieved hiv for person A how soon would I be contagious after the 15th. Ireguardless of the answer  I'm getting tested tomorrow and letting person A and B know about my concern. Also is hiv infectious before it shows up on a test?

From what i understand he got it at the beginning of october but after doing some research i believe it was a little earlier. I am worried because we have been having unprotected sex and her and her brother have hung out various times during this period sharing food drinks, hugs, and most likely not worried about spreading any type of diseases. I am really scared right now because she isnt taking it very serious and was lying and changing the subject when i talked about the possibility that she could have contracted it.

I’m going back in on Friday for the 45 day mark for a follow up 4th Gen. test as recommended but have been reading that the RNA tests are essentially used as conclusive testing and have a 99%% specificity rating at 28 days but have only found this information in a few places with some saying its 33 days for that rating.

I study how to engage people into care, get tested for HIV and get them virally suppressed.

I have been reading posts on here for a while and I would like to request help from this HIV community. As an organization, we have &gt;5000 HIV patients in our care across the state of Florida. However, we still have more work to do to engage underrepresented populations into care (African-American, MSM, Women, minorities, etc.)

Being relatively new to this organization, and HIV medicine, I am learning about strategies tried in the past but there are still gaps and inefficiencies. The areas we are serving range greatly in socioeconomic demographic backgrounds as well as varying HIV education levels. We want to engage the AA and MSM populations especially but there is strong stigma/discrimination in some of our Florida counties. 

I feel like there is a great opportunity here to engage the Reddit community in the innovation of these strategies and I would love for someone to shed light and educate me on their experiences, what works, what doesn't work, etc.

Thank you in advance."

Got 3 tests done (first at the doctor came back negative, but it wasn’t done after 3 months after the tattoo so my paranoia wasn’t gone, then a second rapid at home test also negative but that also wasn’t enough for me, and now a 3rd one at the doctor negative). My doctor is fed up with me because I always faint during the blood test. I’m like “hi my friend it’s me again and yes I am going to faint again ;)”

And since then I became so interested in HIV my best friend and my mom are so fed up with me because it’s all I talk about. I’ve watched 183782 documentaries, read many news articles, expressed my hate towards HIV/AIDS dissidents on social media (I know some personally, who are in the “woke” community), I was never interested in science but now I watch videos on gene editing and the nature of HIV that I just find it all so interesting. 

It’s so fascinating how medicine nowadays made it go from a fatal to a chronic illness, and people who are seropositive and take ARV live healthy wholesome lives, and cannot even pass the virus on when they’re undetectable EVEN if they cum 300 times per day in their partners anal cavity. How cool is that. They take their medication - they can’t even pass it on! 

Fuckin hell I was so uneducated and was one of the moral-less morons who made aids jokes occasionally. If you asked me 6 months ago if I’d ever date someone who’s seropositive I’d say fuck no. Now I’d say take your antiretrovirals and show me your balls mi amor!!!!!

I’m sorry, and I wish every single one of you a happy life and a good path! I hope one day we’ll be able to break the stigma, and protect those both seropositive and seronegative 💜"

Long story short, I was a pro wrestler for 15 years before being sidelined with cancer (that I later found out was caused by HIV). Once I went into remission, I attempted to return to wrestling, but was unfortunately met with the expected difficulty you'd imagine someone who's HIV+ would face. I spent most of 2019 being booked on shows, then promptly removed when other wrestlers protested. In all, I was booked and removed from 7 shows before finally giving up and accepting that I wouldn't be able to overcome the stigma of being contagious, which is sad because my intent was to use pro wrestling as a way to educate people and pull them out of the 80s.

Recently I decided that I wasn't going to accept the ignorance and misinformation any longer. Pro wrestling has been one of the most important things in my life for as long as I can remember and I refuse to let other people's lack of education take that away from me. Despite only learning I was + in January, I figured out I've actually had it as early as 2013, which means I've wrestled with HIV for 5 years, many matches in fact were extremely bloody, and upon announcing my status not a single person has said they were also HIV+. I began aggressively pointing out that fact across social media every day and making it impossible to just ignore.

Recently, I've noticed that people are starting to take notice and pay attention. Little by little, it's got people questioning what they think they know about HIV. So far, I've been contacted by a few promoters who want to book me and have assured me that under no circumstances are they going to pull the booking. It isn't a lot, but right now I have potentially 4 shows lined up for early 2020, and I have a feeling that it may lead to more. This is probably the most hopeful I've been since receiving my diagnosis back in January. I'll come back with updates as things develop."

The article states that the blood came from someone whose viral load was less than 50 / mL.

What interested me was that the person had HIV antibodies on day 1 but then showed no antibodies the days after, following PEP treatment. Undetectable status has been proven to prevent transmission during sexual activity, but I don't think it accounts for needle sharing, does it? This makes me think that the next wave of HIV patients in the future may be more isolated to those who share needles and that transmission via sexual contact may be curbed due to PrEP and TasP."

No cum whatsoever, don’t know if pre-cum cause I can’t remember but I would say no as well or at least very little.
I had a small lesion inside my mouth cause I bite myself when I’m nervous or bored, but that lesion was healed already from what I recall I was not bleeding from anywhere.

How did the Democrats react to the statement? [They are harshly critical, of course](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-world-aids-day-budget_n_5de42205e4b0d50f32a42bc4?utm_campaign=hp_fb_pages&amp;utm_source=main_fb&amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;ncid=fcbklnkushpmg00000063&amp;fbclid=IwAR2YIRcq-vc_D2_O-Q2KuVgPnhMc1AKv_hgAHz8mBe07dYsvzTdKcf7x4Is). The Democratic National Committee said that Trump is “no ally of people living with HIV, who are disproportionately LGBTQ and people of color.” To translate it from political-hypocritical into plain English, Trump is yet again called a racist -- because there are “people of color” who suffer most from HIV, and a homophobe and transphobe – for the same reason.

Then comes a bizarre “explanation” of this statement: “His \[Trump\] administration has proposed cutting global HIV-prevention programs and attacked health care services that people living with HIV rely on, including the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, and Planned Parenthood,” DNC Chairman Tom Perez, DNC Disability Council Chairman Tony Coelho and DNC LGBTQ Caucus Chairman Earl Fowlkes said in a joint statement.

As is usually the case with Democratic rhetoric, there are some major gaps in its logic, making it simply fallacious, and, therefore, leading to the wrong conclusions.

First, while indeed the Trump administration has proposed slashing the budget for the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) by almost 24 percent, with particularly steep cuts to humanitarian aid, refugee assistance, and global health programs, it is only a half-truth about the Administration’s policy on HIV/AIDS.

I’m about to take an important decision for my life. I hope you guys can give me some advises. Currently I live in France and I am unemployed. Last week I got a job offer (1 year contract) from South Carolina-USA. It seems so far good news for me. But,

I live with HIV since 2017.  In France, I don’t pay anything for my medicine and hiv treatment. As a foreigner in France, I am very happy that my all health-care expenses (related to HIV) are covered by my social -state health insurance. I have also private insurance to cover other health problems expenses. Even through I am currently unemployed, unemployment service in France helps me to find a job in France  and let me stay in France two years (depending how many years you worked in France) and lastly my insurance pays all my healthcare expenses. My free healthcare benefit will end in 2026. However, my unemployment wage will end in 2021 February and after I have to move back to my home country where hiv treatment is vexed question. 

I have two pathways in my near future. Staying in France and trying to find a job and finally demanding French nationality OR

going to USA and starting a new life at SC. 


It seems that staying in France is best choice, however finding a job in my domain is difficult and going USA will increase my chance to be able to find a permanent contract in future.  And I am not sure that I will get French nationality if I stay one year more in France.  

MY REAL CONCERN, healthcare system in USA for hiv treatment. As a foreigner, may I get a free hiv medicine during my employment? What about if my contract ended or I got fired, Can I still get benefit from health insurance?  After one year, if I cannot renew my contract, can I get benefit unemployment wage or health insurance?  The only scared thing is to go back to my home country but life as a hiv positive foreigner is very complicated and taking such an important decision is not easy. If I ever leave from France, I cannot come back to here unless I find a job here. I can only bring one biktarvy box with me. I don’t know how the procedure in SC health system is and how long it takes to start my hiv treatment at there. I am sorry guys but I have many questions and don’t have a real answer. If you guys ever read my text up to this point, could you share your comments about my concerns? Especially health insurance in USA as a hiv positive foreigner.

I am referring to body changes and signs that there is something off with you.

I'll start first.

1. Contrary to what I read in journals and hear from others, I never had nightsweats.
2. Sometimes, I lose appetite. I had a fever once and it's normal not to taste anything. But even after recovering, I haven't had my tastebuds back for a couple of months. 
3. I had swollen lymph nodes. Not only in the usual area like neck, groin and armpits. I started to develop bumps with puss in my chest (looked like boils and a couple of them) and in the lobule area of my ears. Even in my legs. 
4. Severe diarrhea which lasted for a couple of weeks. There are even times when I cant control and shit just comes out while Im in bed.
5. Very dry and scaly skin. My skin becamse very sensitive and very itchy. Scratching them would immediately result to small wounds.
6. I easily get tired.
7. I shed a lot of hair. Even when taking a bath and combing my hair with my fingers, clumps of hair would shed.
8. I lost a lot of weight. Max of 20kgs.
9. Due to fat loss, I felt cold. Even at 42 degrees celsius, I will shake.
10. My knees felt weak. I cant even stand for 10mins. My shoulders hurt and cant even do simple tasks.

I ignored those signs as I was constantly reading pro-ana blogs and I thought I was becoming one.

I have excluded infections like TB and pneumonia since those were really the red flags which convinced my doctor to have me tested.

PS. I dont experience any of those now as I am on ARV. I felt normal and when you see me on the streets, you wouldn't even think I have hiv. 
I havent lost my appetite since then. 
I also eat like a pig now. Give me 2 burgers and I would finish them in less than 5 minutes. Hahaha"

I’m a 17 year old girl, have only had unprotected sex with my one and only boyfriend and I’m not worried I’ve caught anything from him as I’m sure he’s being faithful and has only had one other partner besides me. But in September, while using the bathroom at school, after wiping I noticed a tiny spot of blood on the toilet tissue that I know wasn’t mine, and I hadn’t noticed it till after I wiped. It looked dry, and honestly it could’ve just been from some girl that got a little messy on her period but idk it’s still just that: what if you’re not okay? Feeling. I already have severe health anxiety just in general and have convinced myself I probably have about 10 other diseases but what makes me most uneasy is I do have hemorrhoids so I’m scared I wiped the spot against it and have contracted hiv from that. About 6 weeks maybe even more after I got a little cold that didn’t last long but I know that even if the symptoms aren’t severe, it doesn’t mean you don’t have it. And my feet have been tingling for a few months since, my muscles twitch constantly, always on and off muscle pains that last 3 seconds then leave and then move to another part of my body. My throat is sore on and off and I know it’s flu season so I try to be as rational as possible but sometimes my lymph nodes will be swollen slightly when I’m not even sick. And I went to the hospital in October, for a different reason and I got blood tests ran and he said that everything but my white blood cells were normal, he said I’m supposed to be in the 5 range but it was more like 4.something, can’t remember. So now I already know my immune system isn’t as strong as it should be and I’m just a little nervous that I got unlucky in that bathroom :( I know I sound stupid and you all are rolling your eyes at this but I just want to talk to someone about it cause I still haven’t quite understood just how easy it is to transmit the virus. Some articles say hiv dies soon after exposure to air or when it dries and some articles say hiv lives for days and weeks even in dried blood. Some articles say a small drop of blood is enough to transmit it and some say it isn’t enough. And I tried to get tested at planned parenthood a week ago but they wouldn’t test me because I recently got tested a few months ago(literally a day after I came in contact with the blood but now I know that even if I didn’t contract it, it wouldn’t show up on tests right away) and haven’t changed partners so they said there’s no reason to test. So can someone tell me how likely it is that I have hiv?"

Long story short, went to Osaka as a foreigner and roamed the streets of Dotonbori at 2am and a lady recommended me a girl. 

There was no oral sex or penetration / intercourse involved . 
Throughout the session she only gave me a 20min handjob w a condom on (at the start) but I am unsure whether it came off after awhile. She sucked my nipples and constantly touched my body (legs/balls/arms) while I touched her bare boobs /shoulder/back and her vagina (but she was still wearing panties).

Also , I took off my shirt halfway into it and what I’m afraid of is whether the contact w the mattress and my back (I think I have some back acne) will transmit anything. I’m quite certain the mattress wasn’t damp or anything though? 

Please help advice me on whether i could’ve contracted anything ..."

I weighed around 90kgs. That was also the time that I stumbled upon a video featuring a new model named Lindsey Wixson.
Fast forward after graduation, my weight fluctuated. I shed around 30 kgs on my first 6 months working as a call center agent. Then I gained weight again.
The I got really heartbroken in 2017. That is when I turned the pages again of Vogue (I know it's too gay).
Then I found this model named Magda Frackowiak. She looked so thin but very youthful. I had that mindset where thin people get whatever and whoever they want.
I equated being wanted to having thin physique.
I wasnt clinically diagnosed with any eating disorder but everyday, I would change my wallpaper and have photos of models.
My ribcage and collarbones stated to protude.
I was 27 but my body is comparable to a 12-yr old boy. As I shed too much day, I always felt cold even in the summer. Mind you, its 40 degrees celsius.
There were days where I wont eat for 3 days or more. I only have coffee, water and sugar.
And if I eat, I would try to puke.
I felt that he would love me back if I was thinner.
Im the type of homo who wants to have very thin body and I wasnt really into building muscles.
Food became my enemy for a while.

I believe that that is also one of the reasons why the virus really thrived as my immune system was deteriorating.

Now, Im back at 70kgs and feel so much happier.

Anyone had the same experience?

HSV (herpes simplex) is a known risk factor for HIV infection.

Further, HSV infections are sometimes known to be more severe in persons who are HIV positive and can also exacerbate HIV. 

I wonder whether you are aware whether you are seropositive for HSV and whether you have had problems with HSV and whether you find it bothersome to have both HSV (herpes outbreaks and lesions or needing to adjust your HIV meds because of HSV coinfection).

Im an HSV2 positive who is HIV negative but I’m trying to understand the impact of HSV on various groups.

So I know this subreddit is not at all a substitute for actually getting a professional diagnosis... so right away, yes, I will be getting tested soon. But the anxiety and worries before my appointment to get tested is honestly killing me, so I thought I'd hop on here to see what the people think.

The first time I ever did it was in 2016 and the most recent time was sometime in November 2019. Between 2016 and now I've hooked up with probably about 20-30 guys, all from the sites Craigslist (when it was alive) and Grindr (started using that in 2018). All male on male. All unprotected. I only recieved anal like 3 times. Only topped once (maybe twice). Only one time vaginal with a woman (apparently my foreskin ripped during it... so I guess if she had HIV I'd be already done for?). So, most of the time it was giving/recieving sucking and getting rimmed. I'd usually ask most of the time if they were ""disease free"" and unless they said yes nothing would happen, so there's that.

As far as symptoms go, I can barely recall since over the timespan of 3 years it's hard keep track of and remember how many times you've gotten sick. Of course I've had many fevers/flu/illness like symptoms over that time, so I don't know what to think. Never really had anything balantly obvious symptoms such as sores or discharge or stuff like that. Only symptom over the years that really got me thinking of STDs is a UTI I randomly got. And recently knowing that the beginning of HIV causes flu-like symptoms, it has me thinking of the time during (just my luck) hurricane Irma of 2017 when I got a bad 104 crippling fever out of literally no where. Latest ailment I had was a 5-6 month long cough. Everything was dealt with due to regular check ups by the doctor... so at the very current moment? No symptoms of the sort, mostly all good and healthy. Only thing that's stopping me from getting sleep, eating, plaguing my mind and just leaving me feeling generally unwell with a constant feeling of doom is the potential fact that I have HIV.

We'll know the truth soon enough, but what do you guys think? Does everyone lie about their ""disease free-ness"" on apps like Craigslist and Grindr? Are the activities I partaked in really low risk or high risk? Is 20-30 guys in the span of 3 years too many? Am I done for or do I have a chance? I couldn't care less about getting the curable STDs, but the uncurable HIV? That's my worst nightmare. Someone on another subreddit told me that in the worst case scenario (receptive anal with all 20-30 partners being HIV+) I'd only have a 35% chance of having it, which is shockingly low from what I expected. So many questions, I know... but maybe this'll help me alleviate stress, because I really need it now."

I am male had sex with a female prostitute and now extremely scared of HIV. Initially she gave me a bath with handjob(no ejaculation), no kissing at all.

The point I am getting scared is the final bit. Where she gave me a hand job without condom and prostate massage. 

I got scared shitless and contacted a doctor. He advised taking antibacterial shots (azithromycin + ceftoxime) against any bacterial issues and also put me on pep within 24 hours (around 15 hours mark).

Anyways, we didnt so any anal, or insertion. It was only oral, but I did swallow. I know swallowing isnt as risky for HIV because of stomach acid or something, but I did have a canker sore in my mouth.

# Updated: Blacks and the Spread of HIV/AIDS

📷

**Update 12/26/2019:** Since this was first published, many more specific cases of blacks knowingly spreading HIV/AIDS have been brought to my attention. They have been added to the chronological list below. Thanks to everyone who helped me put together this list.

Eastern and Southern African nations have [higher rates](https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/sub-saharan-africa/overview) of [HIV/AIDS](https://www.amren.com/tag/aids/) than the rest of the world. Blacks in the [United States](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/racialethnic/africanamericans/index.html) also have higher infection rates than non-whites. Many migrants from sub-Saharan Africa also [contract the disease](https://sti.bmj.com/content/early/2019/07/26/sextrans-2019-054080) once they arrive in [Europe](https://www.amren.com/tag/europe/).

What causes this? First, many Africans hold [outlandish theories](https://www.amren.com/tag/curious-customs-and-beliefs/) about the ways HIV/AIDS can be contracted, cured, or treated. One horrifying belief is that sex with a virgin will cure AIDS. The inevitable result is child rape.

[In 1998, *The Los Angeles Times* reported](https://www.amren.com/news/1998/11/o-tempora-o-mores-november-1998/):

&gt;This belief has lead \[sic\] to an epidemic of child rape. “It is hard to find a virgin of 16 nowadays, so men are turning to babies under 10,” says Mamelato Leopeng, an AIDS worker from South Africa.  
Because one in four adult males are infected with HIV in some parts of Africa, they are infecting large numbers of young girls. In Zambia, the rate of HIV infection among teenage girls is five to seven times the rate for boys — largely the result of forcible sex with older men. Although a great many rapes in Africa go unreported, in Zimbabwe the number reported increased 30 percent in the last five years. In 1997, more than half of the victims were children, many younger than five. Some young girls are raped by their own fathers or relatives. Many women now report that they are afraid to leave their daughters alone with any man, no matter how close a relative.  
One Zimbabwe rapist who called himself “King AIDS” was recently sentenced to life in prison for knowingly infecting an eight-year-old. “We even have cases of children still in \[diapers\] being raped,” says Jacqueline Pratt, acting chief magistrate of the criminal courts in Harare, the capital city.  
Zorodzai Machekanyanga, who heads an AIDS group for women in Zimbabwe, says the problem is rooted in African culture. “The girl child has no value in African society; she is a thing to be used to make men’s lives better.” Women are also thought to be the source of sexually transmitted diseases. In Shona, the majority language in Zimbabwe, AIDS and syphilis are literally called “women’s diseases.”  
Although child rape has come under increasing scrutiny because it has become a conduit for AIDS, it is an old practice in Africa. Witch doctors have traditionally prescribed sex with a virgin as a powerful cure for a variety of diseases and personal problems.

I assume a lot of people here have new HIV infections so I want to assure you this result isn’t destiny. In fact my uncle-in-law and uncle both got HIV in the 1980s and have hummed along well for 30 years.  The length of their relationship and life with HIV is super inspiring.

They have a relationship where they bicker, yell and love. Finally got married in Georgia when they could.  Never stopped loving a good drink or a buzz.  To me it’s the kind of imperfect bickering love story I can ID with.

My uncle-in-law has had severe COPD from smoking for years and entered the hospital with pneumonia.  To everyone’s shock it turns out he stopped taking his HIV drugs several months ago and has severe AIdS. There is no way to cure the pneumonia.  We’ve concluded he was tired of being unable to breath and decided to let go.

Obviously a lesson here is to not smoke.

But anyway he was awesome, super supportive when my sister came out as bi.  I’m scheduled to fly out for the moment when they pull the plug for us as a family.  I’ll really miss him.  He dated my uncle for 30 years and they finally got married two years ago after it was legal. I feel they did a lot and accomplished a lot and admire their bickering but loving and constant relationship."

People are scouring the internet looking for statistics on people who have contracted HIV from strictly oral sex. Doctors and researchers can’t find a documented case of it happening, out of the millions who have it.

Now you have one. You have a documented case in your possession. I’m still in contact with the person, I have the texts, I have photos, I have proof. All we’re waiting for now are the results. I’ve already tested negative at 28 days from the presumed infection, so if the test comes back positive in March, it’s going to be confirmed.

**The case:**

I’m 27 years old, during the holidays I created a Grindr account. I understand the risks associated with Grindr as an app, but I thought I would use my own discernment to navigate them. An old friend found my profile and repeatedly beckoned me to come to his house because he wanted to do oral sex.

In my mind this was a low risk activity. I get there and hanging out on the couch, he removed my clothes and begins to perform cunnilingus on my exposed penis. I wasn’t really okay with this situation because while statistics say the risk is close to zero, once you’re actually face to face doing it, it can become quite scary.

So I could not get hard. In the past, I know just how easy it is for something to get into your urethra, I am circumcised and I normally precum a lot. My experience, in the past of a condom falling off and catching an std, it changed my perspective on any type of anal sex. So I stopped doing that years ago. And I was just thinking, “It’s just saliva, but I don’t know what’s in his mouth, what if my urethra opens up and I’m exposed and contract HIV?”

He uses meth. He had a bong, I carefully take a small puff.

He takes out this metal cock ring and tries to put it on. Which scared me even more because I don’t know where it’s been. But there’s no blood or cum on it, so it couldn’t have posed a risk. It was kinda hard to get on though but eventually it did.

It all became too much. I got up and went into the bathroom to snoop and check myself out, but he immediately followed me into the bathroom. Now that the methamphetamine is starting to work, our sexual desire is starting to grow. Since he was in the bathroom with me, my chances of finding ART in his cabinet were dashed.

Now this could’ve been the fatal mistake, we are just rubbing on each other, (he has a nice body) and I get on my knees. Just a quick suck... well my instincts kicked in and I hesitated to go for it. Looking at his penis before I licked, I hadn’t really seen it in person before. And I stopped, it looked pretty normal except for what may have been minor bumps. There were no obvious gushing wounds, cuts or oozing sores. But this is the moment of no return because as soon as I stopped to look at his penis, he unscrews the lightbulb and sticks it in my mouth.

So for about 15 seconds I have my mouth on a penis of a man I don’t really know and don’t know his status, and I’m in the dark. this is just insane, I get up and open the door. He goes off into the bed room, I go back to the couch pull out an iPad and at least try to jerk it to some porn. 

The meth played a big role because I was actually really interested at that point, however I couldn’t get hard enough to do anything. So at this point he isn’t even in the room and I just get too spooked and decide to simply leave and then that was the extent of the interaction.

I did look inside of his mouth, but I didn’t get a good look. I noticed that one tooth on the right side of his mouth is I’m not sure, sharp? Exposed? Maybe it was fine maybe it was not but when I got in the bathroom to check myself, there was no blood or anything down there. As far as his precum, he wasn’t really hard and there was none.

This has me very concerned because, if there was no precum, no cum, no blood, no ejaculation, no massaging, how would I ever contract HIV? There are two other factors I would have to put on the table, if it comes to that. And if I’m really HIV negative, then what’s really concerning is why and how are all of the symptoms matching up with seroconversion perfectly. I have everything documented in a calendar, as it happened.

At 28 days, an HIV test says negative. 

**Factors**

* A metal cock ring put at the base of the penis, where the genital area may have folliculitis. This metal cock ring was not removed for several days.
* Finger biting disorder, in which I instinctively licked a superficial wound to remove blood but this was days later.
* 5 minutes after the potential exposure, I drank hot tea and so I’m not sure if drinking hot beverages would open up the blood vessels.
* Gingivitis severe or mild: on a scale I would say my gingivitis is 1 out of 10, it does not bleed by itself. Only when flossing.
* Contracted oral gonorrhea, not sure if HIV can travel with that or in that.
* I don’t know how a bong works but he made a comment that he could put meth up his ass, what was the liquid inside the bong and is it possible to have inhaled something like hiv or something else that’s making me sick?

**Factors in the supposed seroconversion**

* About 17 days after the exposure, on Christmas Eve, I woke up with a sore throat that I would describe as “every time I swallowed it was like a car crash.” It was extremely difficult to swallow. I actually made various posts on reddit /flu when it was happening.
* As a heavy drinker, much of the symptoms got lost in the drinking, chills, the fever, the lymph nodes, aches in my wrists, and I immediately went back to sleep. Woke up in the middle of the night with sweats, had various sensations and nightmares but that was usually normal with my drinking.
* What I thought was oral thrush was probably just Ensure, I drank it to restore vitamins after the drinking and to help recover faster. Which didn’t seem to work.
* Tiny red bumps on my nose

**Things I noticed after the antibiotics treatment**

* Tiny red bumps confined to a small area on my right lower back.
* Poor diet before going on antibiotics, meaning I hadn’t eaten anything but rice for a week. 
* One instance of diarrhea, only after the antibiotics.
* Nausea, lack of appetite
* For a little while after treatment, drinking tea, I could feel my pharynx burn in an unusual way. As if the liquid is running over a scar.


What was all of those symptoms? Was it malnourishment, the oral gonorrhea? Was it mono? It seemed likely to me that it has to be, for my symptoms, it has to be mono or HIV. I didn’t think oral gonorrhea, *pharyngeal gonorrhea* had symptoms that pronounced. And why do I walk around dizzy, with a headache, loss of appetite and low energy? I have nothing in my life to compare this to. I might be able to get up and do things for a few minutes but I get tired and uneasy, cloudy headed and need to get back in bed. And sleep doesn’t help.

**TL/DR The facts:**

* 27 male HIV- with 38 male HIV+
* No visible fluid exchange
* Not erect
* Meth was involved
* Strictly oral
* No cuts or abrasions or sores
* HIV- male has okay dental health, only bleeds if flossed

It’s not over yet. This case is going to be a riveting one once you hear about all of the factors that lined up perfectly for this outcome. I will either be the guy who sucked the dick of a highly infectious HIV positive meth addict and didn’t get HIV or I will be one of the cases that shows you can contract HIV through oral sex with an extremely small amount of blood and precum, and on top of that was one of the 5% of people with a test that showed positive after 3 months.

Now I understand that the HIV have a window period of exposure but I’m just very scared I might have contracted something. So far I have not had any suspicious symptoms related to HIV. I have gotten checked a few months back coming back as negative. I’m just afraid of what may happen as I’m in a loving relationship, but used an escort for the purpose of loneliness.

We did it on the 6th of Jan, so in order for me to be infected he would’ve needed to get it from someone between the 18th-6th. Though I know he’s on PrEP, the chances of him doing it with someone who is positive, causing him to be infected (though the PrEP should stop that in its tracks), and him passing it onto me is not impossible.

What causes me to worry is that I’ve recently got a sore throat which is a symptom of HIV- next week will be 4 weeks exactly, so I’m getting tested then, but I’m really scared."

Sexual BG: non-reactive since Jan. 2018. Had one protective anal sex (top). Had multiple oral sex (I have bleeding gums, Though I don’t let cum catch my mouth). I had one intense oral sex that my partner made me deepthroat him to the point I had sore throat the next day. That happened somwhere in Oct. 2019.

Let’s flesh out my “symptoms” one by one:
-Cough - I’ve had sever cough from November to December. Green phlegm. After taking antibiotics, my phlegm was clear and cough reduced. Right now I still have cough, but usually no phlegm. It’s like clearing my throat through cough.

-One mouth sore and sore throat - they occurred at the same time. I also had a fever to top it off. This happened somewhere Jan. 9-13.

-Joint pain - I’ve been having knee pain since early 2019 probably because I was overweight. But I’ve been having pain on some other parts of the body too. Foot, shoulder, hand, etc. Have had cramps too.

- Chest pain - this was the most recent one. I’m experiencing pain on certain parts of my ribs. Having light back pain too. (Gone as of this writing)

-Night sweat - Im an excessively sweaty guy, and I live in SEA (tropical climate). But what’s weird is that my bro doesn’t have night sweats. And only my head part sweats. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night with my scalp sweating, not my body. But in the morning, my head is dry. 

Do I have HIV, you think?"

Same symptoms as the first time, only a little bit of discharge, no painful urinations or ejaculations. Took the antibiotic again, which is supposed to take 7 days to cure you. Currently on the 5th day, and the discharge is still happening, but I do feel generally better than I did a week ago. But the discharge still worries me, no other symptoms of any std tho. Should I be worried about hiv?"

Still waiting for the 6 weeks to go before the test will 100 % say if I have it or not.

I rarely get rashes, but lately I've seen more of it. Idk if it's because I'm hyper-vigilant about it ... I'm trying to mentally prepare myself, to basically expect a + diagnosis. Trying to tell myself that it's sort of like diabetes, that there are a lot of people that live with chronic illnesses that they have to take medication against for the rest of their lives ...

I didn't find the guy particularly ""dangerous"", he's only done coke once (no needle risk) and had unprotected sex once (if he's telling the truth), he also seems a bit inexperienced. But he did want to go without a condom, so he doesn't seem very aware of potential risks. He told me about this girl from South Africa that he was seeing, and SA has the most HIV in the world.

Maybe I'm overreacting. I have been diagnosed with health anxiety. I feel like swallowing is more difficult now, like my lymph glands are swollen ... But I noticed a rash before I even knew that an HIV rash is a thing. Feeling light-headed.

I don't know if the rashes I've had are even HIV-like. I think the first rash I got could've been due to shaving, it was on my left knee. I got the other one around a pimple on my right arm, it was like just red around the pimple and it went away quite quickly (like an hour or something?). The last one was on my stomach, seemed almost like scratches but also small dots. Idk, I've been travelling, maybe there's changes in the water or something.

What are HIV rashes like? I've been googling a lot but I'm not sure if the photos are from the actual HIV or if they're caused by the HIV medication. Do the rashes last over a long period of time, or can they go away quickly (like mine have)? (I know that HIV rashes aren't always present so it doesn't really matter anyway.)

If the test results are negative I'm gonna see it as a second chance and I'll never again have sex with anyone before they've had themselves tested. I feel very aware of my mortality atm."

Thursday 27 February 2020

BHIVA has received enquiries about the novel Coronavirus, COVID-19, in people with HIV.

There is no evidence so far to determine whether people with HIV are at greater risk of COVID-19 acquisition or severe disease. The main mortality risk factors to date are older age and co-morbidities, including renal disease and diabetes. Some groups with relatively lower immune suppression, such as the very young and pregnant women, do not appear to be at higher risk of complications, although the numbers analysed are very small. PHE advises that clinicians should be alert to the possibility of atypical presentations in patients who are immunocompromised.

BHIVA recommends:

Following the regularly updated advice from Public Health England, Health Protection Scotland, Public Heath Wales, the Department of Health Northern Ireland and the Health Service Executive Ireland.

Ensuring people with HIV have received influenza and pneumococcal vaccination in line with BHIVA vaccine guidelines."

Adam Castillejo is still free of the virus more than 30 months after stopping anti-retroviral therapy.

He was not cured by the HIV drugs, however, but by a stem-cell treatment he received for a cancer he also had, [**the Lancet HIV**](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhiv/article/PIIS2352-3018(20)30069-2/fulltext) journal reports.

The donors of those stem cells have an uncommon gene that gives them, and now Mr Castillejo, protection against HIV.

In 2011, Timothy Brown, the ""Berlin Patient"" became the first person reported as cured of HIV, three and half years after having similar treatment.

*Last Updated: March 20, 2020; Last Reviewed: March 20, 2020*

This interim guidance reviews special considerations for persons with HIV and their health care providers in the United States regarding COVID-19. Information and data on COVID-19 are rapidly evolving. This guidance includes general information to consider. Clinicians should refer to updated sources for more specific recommendations regarding COVID-19.

**Guidance for all Persons with HIV**

* In current reports, individuals aged &gt;60 years and those with diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or pulmonary disease are at highest risk of life-threatening COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus known as SARS-CoV-2.

* The limited data currently available do not indicate that the disease course of COVID-19 in persons with HIV differs from that in persons without HIV. Before the advent of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), advanced HIV infection (i.e., CD4 cell count &lt;200/mm3) was a risk factor for complications of other respiratory infections. Whether this is also true for COVID-19 is yet unknown.

* Some people with HIV have other comorbidities (e.g., cardiovascular disease or lung disease) that increase the risk for a more severe course of COVID-19 illness. Chronic smokers are also at risk of more severe disease.

* Thus, until more is known, additional caution for all persons with HIV, especially those with advanced HIV or poorly controlled HIV, is warranted.

* Every effort should be made to help persons with HIV maintain an adequate supply of ART and all other concomitant medications.

* Influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations should be kept up to date.

* Persons with HIV should follow all applicable recommendations of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to prevent COVID-19, such as social distancing and proper hand hygiene. These recommendations are regularly updated.

* Information on COVID-19 prevention in children with HIV for pediatric health care providers and the general public is available from CDC.

* CDC also provides information about COVID-19 prevention during pregnancy.

**Antiretroviral Therapy**

Persons with HIV Should:

Maintain on-hand at least a 30-day supply—and ideally a 90-day supply—of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs and other medications.
Talk to their pharmacists and/or healthcare providers about changing to mail order delivery of medications when possible.
Persons for whom a regimen switch is planned should consider delaying the switch until close follow-up and monitoring are possible.
Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) has been used as an off-label treatment for patients with COVID-19 and clinical trials are underway globally. If protease inhibitors (PIs) are not already part of a person’s ARV regimen, their regimen should not be changed to include a PI to prevent or treat COVID-19, except in the context of a clinical trial and in consultation with an HIV specialist. In a small open-label trial, 199 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were randomized to either 14 days of LPV/r plus standard of care or standard of care alone. No statistically significant difference was seen between the two groups, with regards to time to clinical improvement or mortality.1

**Clinic or Laboratory Monitoring Visits Related to HIV Care:**

Together with their health care providers, persons with HIV and their providers should weigh the risks and benefits of attending, versus not attending in-person, HIV-related clinic appointments at this time. Factors to consider include the extent of local COVID-19 transmission, the health needs that will be addressed during the appointment, and the person’s HIV status (e.g., CD4 cell count, HIV viral load) and overall health.
Telephone or virtual visits for routine or non-urgent care and adherence counseling may replace face-to-face encounters.
For persons who have a suppressed HIV viral load and are in stable health, routine medical and laboratory visits should be postponed to the extent possible.

**Persons with HIV and in Opioid Treatment Programs:**

Clinicians caring for persons with HIV who are enrolled in opioid treatment programs (OTPs) should refer to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMHSA) website for updated guidance on avoiding treatment interruptions. State methadone agencies are also responsible for regulating OTPs in their jurisdictions and may provide additional guidance.
 

**Guidance for Specific Populations**

*Pregnant Individuals with HIV:*

Currently, there is limited information about pregnancy and maternal outcomes in individuals who have COVID-19.
Immunologic and physiologic changes during pregnancy generally increase a pregnant individual’s susceptibility to viral respiratory infections, possibly including COVID-19. As observed with other coronavirus infections, the risk for severe illness, morbidity, or mortality with COVID-19 may be greater among pregnant individuals than among the general population.2
Although limited, currently available data do not indicate that pregnant individuals are more susceptible to COVID-19 infection or that pregnant individuals with COVID-19 have more severe illness.6,7 Adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as fetal distress and preterm delivery, were noted in a small series of pregnant women with COVID-19 infection and have been reported with SARS and MERS infections during pregnancy.3-5
Findings from a small group of pregnant women with COVID-19 did not find evidence for vertical transmission of COVID-19, although at least one case of neonatal COVID-19 has been described.7-9
Information on pregnancy and COVID-19 is available from CDC, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

*Children with HIV:*

From the limited available data, children appear less likely to become severely ill with COVID-19 infection than older adults.10-12 However, there may be subpopulations of children at increased risk of more severe COVID-19 illness; in studies of infection with non-COVID-19 coronaviruses in children, younger age, underlying pulmonary pathology, and immunocompromising conditions were associated with more severe outcomes.13
Infants and children with HIV should be up to date on all immunizations, including influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. Refer to the Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Exposed and HIV-Infected Children information on immunizations, including a vaccine schedule for children with HIV.
 

**Guidance for Persons with HIV in Self-Isolation or Quarantine Due to SARS-CoV-2 Exposure**

*Health Care Workers Should:*

Verify that patients have adequate supplies of all medications and expedite additional drug refills as needed.
Devise a plan to evaluate patients if they develop COVID-19-related symptoms, including for possible transfer to a health care facility for COVID-19-related care.
Persons with HIV Should:

Contact their health care provider to report that they are self-isolating or in quarantine.
Specifically, inform their health care provider how much ARV medications and other essential medications they have on hand.
 

**Guidance for Persons with HIV who have Fever or Respiratory Symptoms and are Seeking Evaluation and Care**

*Health Care Workers Should:*

Follow CDC recommendations, as well as state and local health department guidance on infection control, triage, diagnosis, and management.
Persons with HIV Should:

Follow CDC recommendations regarding symptoms.
If they develop a fever and symptoms (e.g., cough, difficulty breathing), they should call their health care provider for medical advice.
Call the clinic in advance before presenting to the care providers.
Use respiratory and hand hygiene and cough etiquette when presenting to the healthcare facility and request a face mask as soon as they arrive.
If they present to a clinic or an emergency facility without calling in advance, they should alert registration staff immediately upon arrival of their symptoms so that measures can be taken to prevent COVID-19 transmission in the health care setting. Specific actions include placing a mask on the patient and rapidly putting the patient in a room or other space separated from other people.
 

**Guidance for Managing Persons with HIV who Develop COVID-19**

*When Hospitalization is Not Necessary, the Person with HIV Should:*

Manage symptoms at home with supportive care for symptomatic relief.
Maintain close communication with their health care provider and report if symptoms progress (e.g., sustained fever for &gt;2 days, new shortness of breath).
Continue their ARV therapy and other medications, as prescribed.

*When the Person with HIV is Hospitalized:*

ART should be continued. If the ARV drugs are not on the hospital’s formulary, administer medications from the patients’ home supplies.
ARV drug substitutions should be avoided. If necessary, clinicians may refer to recommendations on ARV drugs that can be switched in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) guidelines for caring for persons with HIV in disaster areas.
For patients who receive ibalizumab (IBA) intravenous (IV) infusion every 2 weeks as part of their ARV regimen, clinicians should arrange with the patient’s hospital provider to continue administer of this medication without interruption.
For patients who are taking an investigational ARV medication as part of their regimen, arrangements should be made with the investigational study team to continue the medication if possible.
For critically ill patients who require tube feeding, some ARV medications are available in liquid formulations and some, but not all, pills may be crushed. Clinicians should consult an HIV specialist and/or pharmacist to assess the best way for a patient with a feeding tube to continue an effective ARV regimen. Information may be available in the drug product label or from this document from the Toronto General Hospital Immunodeficiency Clinic.

*When Receiving Investigational or Off-Label Treatment for COVID-19:*

There is currently no approved treatment for COVID-19. Several investigational and marketed drugs are being evaluated in clinical trials to treat COVID-19 or may also be available via compassionate use or off-label use.
For patients receiving COVID-19 treatment, clinicians must assess the potential for drug interactions between the COVID-19 treatment and the patient’s ARV therapy and other medications. Information on potential drug interactions may be found in product labels, drug interaction resources, clinical trial protocols, or investigator brochures.
When available, clinicians may consider enrolling patients in a clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of experimental treatment for COVID-19. Persons with HIV should not be excluded from these trials. Clinicaltrials.gov is a useful resource to find studies investigating potential treatments for COVID-19.
 

**Additional Guidance for HIV Clinicians**

Some Medicaid and Medicare programs, commercial health insurers, and AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAPs) have restrictions that prevent patients from obtaining a 90-day supply of ARV drugs and other medications. During the COVID-19 outbreak, clinicians should ask providers to waive drug-supply quantity restrictions. ADAPs should also provide patients with a 90-day supply of medications.
Persons with HIV may need additional assistance with food, housing, transportation, and childcare during times of crisis and economic fragility. To enhance care engagement and continuity of ARV therapy, clinicians should make every attempt to assess their patients’ need for additional social assistance and connect them with resources, including navigator services when possible.
During this crisis, social distancing and isolation may exacerbate mental health and substance use issues for some persons with HIV. Clinicians should assess and address these patient concerns and arrange for additional consultations, preferably virtual, as needed.
Telehealth options, including phone calls, should be considered for routine visits and to triage visits for patients who are ill.
More information regarding ARV management in adult, pregnant, and pediatric patients, as well as recommendations for prophylaxis and treatment of specific opportunistic infections, can be found in the medical practice guidelines for HIV/AIDS.

The CDC website provides information about COVID-19 for people with HIV.

This interim guidance was prepared by the following working groups of the Office of AIDS Research Advisory Council:

* HHS Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents
* HHS Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV
* HHS Panel on Treatment of Pregnant Women with HIV Infection and Prevention of Perinatal Transmission
* HHS Panel on Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV

She had tiny sores on her upper lip, but no direct skin to skin contact was made.

3 cycles done (5 repetitions of 30 compressions, 2 breaths through the surgical face mask)

Gargled and spit shortly after, listerine wash about 3 hours following. 

But as night comes I grow concerned and worried. I made a decision for mouth to mouth through my mask since no other resources were available. Should I try and obtain pep?"

A cured customer is a lost customer.

In case you ask me personally, I feel deep inside that a cure to HIV could be found as little as within a year or at least a vaccine. I have the feeling that we gays are still somehow perceived by the public as a second hand category of people and that although the speech has changed and that now people are saying “they’re just people”, there’s still way too little that is done such as actions that would speak louder than words.

I am so saddened to be perceived like that by society and it makes me so sad and so angry inside!

In case white men with money and power were infected, for sure there would be a cure within the year, maybe 2 years tops.

I just feel so disgusted by human nature right now. People are just greedy fucks that don’t give a shit about others. Just like now with COVID-19 and the companies that produce hand sanitizers are pocketing so much money and raising their prices and cashing in so much and limiting stocks and creating shortage to rise demands and prices. Makes me wanna barf and makes me sick to my stomach. This is so wrong, so not how the world should spin...

How can we change things!?!"

After lurking for a few months, I'd like to introduce myself and offer an opportunity for fellow youth living with HIV. 

My name is Sam, I am 24 years old, they/them pronouns, and I've lived with HIV since birth. The doctors didn't think I was going to survive, but here I am. Relatively healthy and striving to thrive. My mother acquired the virus from her now deceased ex-husband (who died from AIDS) and he got it from sharing needles. Due to all this, I'm a huge advocate for harm reduction, PrEP, testing, and helping others communicate their status. My mother's ex knew for a few years and never told us. The only reason my mother found out was because she happened to run into his sister at the grocery store. ""David is dying from AIDS."" I was already a few years old when they tested us both. 

Now I'm undetectable and I take juluca every day. 

April 10th is National Youth HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. I am an ambassador for this important day, but unfortunately due to COVID, my plans have had to change. My new plan is to spread my story to show why testing and PrEP are important while also eliminating stigma. But I would also like to hear from other youth living with HIV. If you would like a 1-2 sentence statement anonymously told, please message me. Our voices need to be heard! You are all important."

4 weeks ago yesterday I (19M) very stupidly had unprotected sex with someone I'd never met (18/19F). 2 weeks later I went to the clinic to get tested, but there was a problem in the lab and the blood test didn't go through. I was clear of Chlamydia and Gonorrhoea.

A couple days after this I come home from uni, and start running on our treadmill, and notice some chafing after a few days. Then because of COVID, I've been washing my hands very often, and about 5 days ago (3 and a half weeks after exposure) the back of my hand goes red and stings after washing my hands with soap. Over the next day it develops into what looks like a very mild case of eczema. I feel like this has since cropped up on multiple parts of my body - my face seems to have some dry skin, the area around my ankles, and my chest hurts for a while after I scratch it, but doesn't visibly look different at the moment. However, I have had the odd problem throughout my life with eczema.

I then see that rash is a symptom of HIV, and I start thinking that I've had a bit of a sore throat now particularly when I wake up in the mornings for the last 3/4 weeks, and there was a period last week (between 2-3 weeks after exposure) of a couple of days where I'd just have about 10 mins of a very minor headache coming and going.

I've experienced no flu-like symptoms, but since seriously considering it last night have been feeling very anxious and worried which has made me feel weird. This is made especially worse by the fact that I don't know how I can get tested for a long time due to the coronavirus crisis.

I tend to be a bit of a hypochondriac, and have been convinced I have problems in the past which have turned out to be fine, but I'm still worried by the sore throat/dry skin situation. Any advice as to how likely it is that I have HIV, and what I should do with regards to testing would be greatly appreciated. I'm in the UK.

Apologies for the long post. Thanks a lot for reading.

TL;DR: 4 weeks ago I had unprotected vaginal sex with a girl I've never met. Since then I have experienced some dry skin cropping up (although I have had eczema problems before, but I worry about the timing) and a weirdly feeling, almost sore throat. I feel like I can't get tested for a while because of the COVID-19 crisis. How likely is it that I have HIV?"

So today my tongue is feeling weird, my tongue look normal but i keep thinking i have oral thrush, yesterday and the day before it felt like my joints were hurting and i have muscles spasms but idk i know the test was negative but keep thinking i have it and they just didn’t detect it because of the month period and its killing me not knowing I can’t work or sleep or do anything if i feel sick I don’t whether its the side effects of gabapentin or not if they couldn’t detect it at 3 weeks could i still experience symptoms?

Per routine, after breaking up, I got an STD/HIV test afterward. I did a rapid result HIV test and it came back negative. 

However, I remember the doctor telling me something like, ""this test freaks people out often because it says positive, but the positive refers to something else"" — I can't remember what she described it as, but basically that the positive actually meant you *don't* have HIV. 

So she told me that between what I told her about the last relationship and the results of the test, I didn't likely need a follow up test but if I wanted to, I could. She told me full on that I was negative for HIV. So I went about my life.

Fast forward to today, this ex comes to me out of the blue and tells me he's got AIDS and found out on the 19th and his current ex has it too. I won't go over all the crazy shit that happened since that conversation, but I reached out to a friend of mine who was actually engaged to him for 2 years after he and I broke up.

She told me that for one, he went nuts and threatened her after they broke up saying he had HIV and she had it too. She tested and found out she was negative. She's also been in fertility treatments and bloodwork recently too, as she's trying to have a baby with her new husband. She told me she just got retested after he told her again on the 20th and he told her he'd ""had it for 7-10 years"" and will find out her results Monday, but she'd tested negative and her doctor told her that HIV would have shown up on her fertility treatment bloodwork.

I'm just freaking out because of the weird way that Planned Parenthood nurse explained the test to me, worried she could be wrong. 

I've got an oral test coming in the mail tomorrow and I'm honestly freaked out.

If she tested negative + had no red flags on her bloodwork/fertility treatment more than 2 years after he and I broke up, should I feel reassured that he's likely been lying to her to scare her? He has a history of saying abusive things to her like this.

I'm also freaked out thinking back to the HIV test I took at Planned Parenthood, how the doctor over-explained it to me in a way I did not understand but summed it up as ""no you don't have HIV, but feel free to re-test if you want.""

All this combined with this guy having had a whole on psychotic break recently and gone balls deep into the drug scene (he was pretty normal when we dated, I never saw any behavior that his ex after me described, but I don't put it past drugs to change someone entirely.)

Any advice/thoughts? I'm honestly freaked the hell out."

Been Poz over 3 years, undetectable, well-controlled on ART and very healthy. 

My experiences:  Yale New Haven health had some great clinicians, but more costly than I’d like on my insurance plan at the time. Meanwhile, the VA Healthcare system hosts some Yale clinicians, but on a rotating basis. 

Not sure if it’s way too much to ask, but I want to develop a lifelong relationship with a care team that is readily accessible and focused on my holistic health - not just maintaining an undetectable status. I feel like there’s not enough attention on overall preventative care.

&gt;In their new research, Dr. Jones and his colleagues have discovered that the virus not only hides. It also endures in reservoir cells because they have developed resistance to being eliminated by killer T cells, which are produced by the body’s immune system and target and destroy cells infected by HIV and other viruses.

&gt;The researchers found that one of the reasons reservoir cells can’t be destroyed by killer T cells is that they overexpress the gene BCL-2, resulting in the elevated production of the BCL-2 protein. This protein is responsible for helping the cells survive because it can interfere with cell death. “These reservoir cells couldn’t be killed because they had a survival mechanism inside,” said first author Dr. Yanqin Ren, a postdoctoral associate at Weill Cornell Medicine.

&gt;However, when researchers treated HIV reservoirs with experimental latency-reversing agents that may reactivate HIV, making it visible to the body’s immune system, HIV-specific T cell treatments to prevent the replication of the virus, and a BCL-2 inhibitor to block the BCL-2 protein, they observed a reduction in reservoir cells.  

&gt;A U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved BCL-2 inhibitor is already available for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but whether or not the drug has a safety profile that would allow it to be tested in a clinical trial of HIV patients remains to be seen, Dr. Jones said.

I am a male 21M years. From Australia. 70kg.

On the 14th March I woke up in bed with a guy, I was at a club the night before &amp; don’t remember getting to his or much that happened. I don’t want to say I was spiked in case I wasn’t, but that’s my feeling about the situation. I rarely ever blackout when drunk. 

From what I can remember, there was oral and possibly anal. But like I said that is only from what I can describe as a single flashback in my memory. I don’t know what happened when I was unconscious.

The next day I felt very uneasy and left straight away, I went back to mine and passed out. When I woke I was sick multiple times. I now started to freak out so went to A&amp;E because I wasn’t on prep and am sure no condoms were used. They prescribed me a 3 day starter pack of PEP (consisting of only truvada - I thought it was supposed to be 3 drugs?) I took the first truvada at 16hrs post exposure. 
I was adamant it was supposed to be 3 hiv drugs so returned twice but each time they said it was only truvada that was required. Eventually I went to a second A&amp;E department and they gave me 6 days worth of truvada + raltegravir (isentress) 400mg. I took the first pill of this at 45hrs post exposure.

So I took 1 truvada at 16hrs
Another truvada at 36hrs 
And my first raltegravir at 45hrs

I then completed the 28 day course of truvada (once daily) and raltegravir twice daily. I didn’t miss any doses and always took them on time. (With the exception of 1 day where I was 3hrs late).

I guess my question is:

Will the delay in having the full 3drug regime effect the efficiency of the pep?
Can truvada alone be used?
How effective is pep?
If I didn’t start till 45hrs with the full regime is it not effective?

I now have body aches and swollen tonsils so I am freaking out that it hasn’t worked. It’s been 5 days since I stopped after completing the full course. When should I get tested? 

Thank you for any help. I’m praying it’s going to be fine."

Hi,
So I'm HIV positive and living in Colorado.  But I plan to move to Florida where it's harder to get Medicaid.
Right now I'm under ADAP and Medicaid in Colorado but I'm going to have to transfer and need to know some things about how to get on medicaid., What they will ask for and generally how long it takes in FLORIDA.

Here in Colorado I got it just because I am not working and make less than the federal poverty amount but in Florida you cannot get Medicaid as an adult male just because you are poor but you can get Medicaid if you are HIV POSITIVE.
So I am looking for advice on where to start, how long the process usually takes, and how do I get started? Thanks a lot"

We did blowjobs (no cum) and rimming. The person claims is clean. I came in the condom which verified the condom was still good (the person put on the condom on my penis but his penis was exposed).

Day 1: Next day I felt a tingling in my lip and i figured something is for sure wrong

Day 2: Tingling went away but muscles feel tense and hurt and goes away quickly

Went to 3 major hospitals. (2 didn't know what is PEP and the third said only for rape victims)

Day 3: My throat is stiff, doesn't hurt to swallow at all. tiny bit of random chill. sweat more than usual but not too much at night.

Day 4: Throat got a lot stiffer, i checked the glands at a doctor and said they are fine. night sweats happens during my sleep only based on armpit smell.

Day 5: Throat continued to get even stiffer and now i started to feel weaker and a headaches are taking over. No chills though.

Other symptoms: I lost food appetite, can't get hard

At this point I'm at full panic, doctor said we can't test for HIV yet wait 2 weeks at least, but they took urine sample for common STDs. Those don't feel feel like a flu, Guys I really need your advice here and experience!"

Long story short, I’m paranoid poopless again (just like in the beginning) and was just wondering (for those who are living with hiv) 
If you also experienced these persistent muscle spasms (in Acute hiv) and if that [cavity](https://imgur.com/a/ttW6rVn) is anything to be worried about. 

I’ll also be going home next month (to a doctor I trust) for an evaluation.

During this time he moved to a different country because his ex wife made it unsafe for him to stay here. As a result of this his son did not have contact with him. 

My brother has become a recluse. He wants his diagnosis to be a secret still even after all these years. My dad blabbed about it years ago and told all his side of the family. My brother then cut us all off. I haven’t seen him in 10 years. The only person he speaks to is my mam and sometimes he ignores her for weeks. 

I just wanted to know if there are other people who shut themselves away in this community and how do their families deal with it? My nephew accidentally found out about my brothers status and since then he got in touch with him. I asked my nephew if he would like me to go with him to see his dad for support if he ever went to visit and he said he would like to in October. I have done a lot of research over the past few years for myself to understand the disease but because I have never spoke to my brother I don’t know if any questions my nephew might ask would be offensive. Are there questions we shouldn’t ask? 

I actually made the decision last year to go see my brother just before Christmas but unfortunately I couldn’t go due to work. My aim was to try to get him to join the family again but I realise this won’t happen overnight. Again if anyone has any experience with this please get in touch."

Please let me know if I'm at high risk in contracting HIV with regards to what I'll be sharing. Inputs from an expert or someone who can pinpoint what is happening in my system would be highly appreciated.

Sex: Male  
Age: 21 years old  
Race: Asian  
Circumcised. (if it matters)  
Heterosexual.  
No drug use using needles or exchange of needles.

All of this happened when I started being sexually active that's why I'm worried. It was with my girlfriend so it happened several times, protected and unprotected sex. Vaginal, oral happened but we never did anal.

Nov. 22, first protected sex.  
Dec. 21, first unprotected sex.

***Symptoms***

* **Jan. 9** \- We had unprotected sex the day before. I also went down on her and gave her oral. Developed rash under my foreskin; small flesh-colored bumps that is itchy and looks irratated, penis glans got bumpy and kinda wrinkled. No white or yellow discharge, no foul-smelling odor. Decided to apply Canesten cream for like two weeks, itching subsided. Also developed small, stinging sores on my tongue. Felt hot and made me hard to chew food. Tongue pain disappeared after a few days but left small lesions on my tongue that doesn't hurt. Penis glans is still wrinkly and kinda dry up to present.
* **Jan. 29 -** Had diarrhea that lasted until March 22. Loose bowel movement, watery stools, lower left abdominal pain with rumbling noises. Went to the doctor on Feb. 15, said I was ""lactose intolerant"", gave me ciprofloxacin and hyos for 1 week. Diarrhea subsided. Though I still have mild rumbling noises up until now.
* **April 3** \- Had constipation and rectal pain that lasted until May 7. Went to the doctor on April 22, said I had a small swelling inside my anus. Gave me metronidazole and tramadol for 1 week. Subsided. Still have slight itching on my anus.
* **May 15** \- Developed a yellow coating at the back of my tongue. Still not sure if it's thrush, been searching on the net what thrush looks like and it matches. I still have it today, while I'm writing this. My lower leg - top area of the feet also itches.

I never had fever, upper body rashes, sore throat, dry cough, swollen lymph nodes ever since I started being sexually active. Headaches, muscle pain, nausea and fatigue are kinda normal to me since I'm a college student and academic stresses me out. I was just alarmed when I read that diarrhea that lasted for like a month, mouth sores and thrush are somehow indicators or symptoms of an Acute HIV Infection.

What is dating like? Do you specifically try to find other people who are positive as well or do you just try to be upfront with whoever you’re talking to and hope for the best? I’m getting tested soon and honestly the taking a pill everyday for the rest of my life doesn’t bother me nearly as much as the stigma. I feel like once you utter the words HIV to anyone they’d immediately disregard the idea of a relationship with you and move on which is quite tragic since there’s no way of transmitting the virus once you’re on ART. Nonetheless, feel free to share as much as you’d like, you won’t find any judging on my end, just plain curiosity.

I always knew I was allergic to pets (I get itchy) however when I was changing one of the cats jumped on me. Again, I get a mild rash.

The next day later, my whole chest, legs and arms had rashes. My pores (the small dots) were all red and it's basically red tiny dots all over my body. I'm hairless (Asian) so it showed alot. I went to the doctors and again he told me it's the ""protein in the animal's hair"" etc etc. I took the perscription (oral and cream) and it went away the next day.

Today when I went grocery shopping after I came back the rashes appeared again -- i'm allergic to pollen/flowers so I think this is the reason why. 

Someone posted images on reddit (they made a topic about their rashes) and their pictures are kind of identical to mine:

https://imgur.com/a/HIJkG
https://imgur.com/a/8BVMz

Anyways, it's been three weeks and I never really thought about HIV until today (when I saw my rashes and realized you can get it from HIV). Again, the cream took care of it so that's why I never thought I had a problem.

I looked at the symptons and it's been three weeks and I didn't get any loss in weight, a cold/flu/fever. 

Going to get tested just in case (does anyone know if I need to prepare for anything? Like what's the procedure)?

Thank you!

I see a lot of positivy on here and I see a lot of poor me, negativity here as well.

I want lted to just come here and briefly mention a few things if I can.

I was diagnosed HIV POSITIVE in 2016 and while it's a horrible disease that kills and has made millions and millions suffer beyond repair, I have taken a different stance.

You see, I shot up drugs, primarily Heroin for nearly 20 years before I got HIV and was sent to state prison for four years.

When I first got the news I didn't know what to really say.  I guess I was a little sad but I had been sharing needles for a while so it didnt come at all as a surprise.  

And once I was explained about having to take medication every day of my life to stay alive and healthy, i thought of it as a good thing that would bring structure into my life.

More to the point though, I knew if I got back on the heroin that I would either stop taking my meds or I would sell them for dope money etc.  
I desperately wanted to get sober so bad and I started the process of psychosocial/spiritual therapy almost instantly when I was finally locked up and sentenced.  And even thou a 4 years sentence SUCKED, I figured I would make the best of it and come out a different person, reborn, totally new and maybe even ressurected if you will.

And I did.  I took classes, found an AA sponsor, did the self work and wow!  The glawesome journey I began in there outweighed the time. 

I got myself knowledgeable on the two diseases I suffer from...Addiction and HIV.

I've been sober a little over 3 years now and life is very different.  Every day I wake up and take my medicine is a reminder of where I could go...of where I could end up of I don't continue my treatment for both of these illnesses.  

So be happy!!!!!!!!!!! Thank God because everything has its purpose and the fact that you have HIV Means that you are right where you are supposed to be.  Shit happens in life and we make bad choices, we are not God and we will never be perfect.

Just really wanted to put a different perspective about this disease out there and let you know, you, YEAH YOU....YOU ARE LOVED AND YOU CAN GET THRPUGH THIS ONE DAY AT A TIME!
Your comments are very much welcomed and appreciated!"

Been seriously nervous the past couple weeks, extremely nervous as a hypochondriac ah!

I'm 18 years old, just finished first year, and I DID use dating apps to hookup with complete strangers when I lived alone on residence (I'm over the craze and not down to hookup like that ever again, marriage only lmao). 

During hookups, we made out, and I gave him an unprotected blowjob, swallowing each time. 

I've hooked up..3..5..ok like 6 or 7 times (5 boys) in total, who seemed clean, but I DONT KNOW. 

I only recently realized (I'm an idiot) that you can actually catch STI through oral sex. It's been 6 weeks since my last hookup (April 23 to be exact). Throughout these hookups, I never experience any major flu, except for a sore throat (itchy throat) for like two days once, but the past year, I had no flu, nothing, not even a cold. I don't even recall getting a headache, so I've been pretty healthy this year touchwood. I did feel exhausted here and there, but like I'm always sleepy and tired because school ruins my sleep schedule lol. 

I'm going for an STI check this Friday (anonymously) without my parent's knowing (living at home now), but I'm getting EXTREMELY SCARED; I'll have to lie saying I'm going to my friend's house. I'm just praying everything comes back negative and I'm healthy because I'll be seriously disowned if my parents find out. (I come from a VERY strict family). 

Is it too soon to check for any STI? From my research, 6 weeks is good time for most of the STI's. 

I'm just really nervous of HIV. What are my chances of contracting HIV from unprotected oral sex with random men, swallowing each time. (I am positive like 2 don't have it, don't know about the other 3). 

IM SO NERVOUS. I'm scared to leave my house on Friday too, like what am I going to tell my parents, how will I leave my house lol ah!"

I had a random sexual encounter using protection with insertive anal. Oral sex was both ways and unprotected but was brief 20-30 seconds only. At this point I'm not sure if the condom used was messed up.

After couple of days I started to feel very **stiff neck and dryness**. A week later I started to get headache that never went away. 3 weeks now and i still have headaches and I feel **lymph nodes pulse**, they don't hurt and not swollen but I feel them pulsing and fading pain under my neck chin. I keep feeling my neck and my lymph nodes as I feel they must be swollen but are not. Also the pulse usually comes from one side only but definitely the whole neck feels off.

I don't feel sick, appetite is still fine, no sweaty nights or flu as of yet, but something is for sure wrong with my neck.

I got tested **negative for COVID19, chlamydia, gonorrhea, HIV** (2 weeks after encounter). I will get tested again for HIV when I'm 5 weeks in.

Doctor gave me **azithromycin for 5 days** but it didn't help.

I am working along with a team of professors who do research in the area of workplace diversity, equity, and inclusion and we're looking to interview people living with HIV/AIDS. Specifically, we are inviting individuals to share their stories and experiences (all interviews would be confidential and no identifying info would be presented). It is our hope that we can share these stories with the scientific and business community in order to make better workplace policies and reduce stigma.

Specifically, we are beginning a study focused on the working experiences of individuals who have been diagnosed with HIV and are looking for people to participate. We are looking for approximately 40 individuals who have received an HIV diagnosis, are currently or have recently been working, are at least 18 years of age, and speak English.  We are looking for a wide range of ages, genders, time since diagnosis (including those in the long term survivor community), and races/ethnicities. Participation in the study includes an interview that will be conducted via phone or video chatting that should take no more than two hours. Everyone who participates will receive a $30 Amazon gift card. If you are interested, please send an email to [nas22@pdx.edu](mailto:nas22@pdx.edu). Also, if you know anybody who might be interested please share and spread the word! Thanks for your help!

**“I would like to meet up with 6-8 HIV positive people, we can have dinner and chat”**

Place: Beijing, China. Time: This week.

**If you’d like to get in contact, please send an email at: xxx.**  
**No need for real names or photos, but I’d like to say your age, gender, hobbies, work, current status of illness and when you have time this week.**

Please be assured that I will protect your privacy.

First of all, **I apologize for the improper wording.** It is more reasonable to say that it is HIV carriers/infected rather than AIDS. **HIV carriers and people with AIDS are not the same group.** It was my fault that I did not pay attention to the words when writing this thread.

After posting this thread, I kept refreshing my inbox. Within five minutes, more than ten letters were received. For the next three days, my colleague and I have been reading letters and looking for their contact details. Some of these letters tell us about their illness and personal situation, whilst others contact us curious to see what the fuss is about. Furthermore, some messages express concern and support and some even expressed bewilderment.

To be honest, there are two common replies that I am particularly puzzled about:

One type of response is:

What are you thinking of? Those who sent emails will demonize HIV carriers, making me fear that even if I had dinner with them I’ll get infected with HIV.

Another response was:

""Wow, I never considered these issues regarding AIDS like this before!""-These people are expressing their compassion, but they talk about it disregarding the hardship that HIV carriers go through and make jokes without knowing the real situation.  
Its similar to raising awareness of HIV/AIDs in middle aged people, only for some uneducated 60-year-old to mention a sex joke and everyone laughs.

**HIV carriers should never be feared as monsters. But this does not mean that AIDS is a joke either.** You should not joke around when you are serious but not be nervous when you are relaxed. This is the perspective that this article wants to convey.

After getting everyone's consent, my colleague created a WeChat group. There were seven HIV carriers and one family member of AIDS patients. On the 19th, a total of ten of us ate this meal together.

I then got a rare immune disorder called HSP, it normally comes from strep throat. It causes vasculitis, a rash and makes your body swell up. Took me 10 weeks to get over it. I had a full blood test 4 times so would HIV show up on that? I’ve now been getting sore armpits. Yet I don’t have a cold and I’ve never a fever. I know the girl who gave me the blow job. I have asked her twice if she has anything and she said she hasn’t. I do believe her as she’s not the type to sleep around. Although her ex did cheat on her. 

I know you are going to say go and get a test. I’m vulnerable in this corona crisis because of my lungs. I don’t want to be going out and about for a test. Just a bit of peace of mind I am after I suppose. 

Am I supposed to ask this here? I tried commenting on that discussion but it said the post was achieved and wouldn’t let me."

About two weeks ago he revealed to me that he is polyamorous. We have been together for about 3 years. I’m grappling with my jealousy and insecurities as I’m monogamous. In the past months, we sort of lost our spark but still deeply love each other. We opened up the relationship for him to fulfill his sexual needs. I asked him to be safe and use protection. We are working hard through this time. But just last night as I asked for more about him.... for him to dig deep and tell me more .... I made a connection and knew there was something he had decided to maybe never tell me. I gently pushed him to tell me he and he told me has HIV and that he is undetectable. He has had HIV for more than seven years and never disclosed it with anyone except maybe his ex-husband who most likely gave it to him. I of course felt another stab in my heart. I’m already hurting from him being poly and him loving someone else... and now I have learned he has put me and others at risk. I don’t trust that he always uses protection as he and I were having unprotected sex every now and then when the relationship was closed. I also get tested regularly for my own peace of mind. It’s a risk I took but I feel he is way more at fault here. 

Before his confession, he said he didn’t want to tell me because I could “use it against him.” I didn’t understand that at first. After his confession, he told me that people could go to prison for exposing others and not disclosing their status. This is something I never knew! I showed him love and told him I understood why he couldn’t tell me (social stigma and everything else attached with having HIV). I was compassionate.

This morning, I asked him to sit with me at the dining table. I held his hands, looked him in the eyes, and asked if he could show me his medicine. I told him that he shouldn’t feel ashamed to take his medicine in secret. And that he could feel free to ask if I could pick it up from the pharmacy for him. I want to support him. He showed me his medicine and I Googled the pills as he showed them to me. My goal in that moment was to learn more about it than I already knew.

But... (and here’s my big dilemma) just later today I realized that I now feel complicit in him putting others at risk. His new relationship is brand new (almost a month). And even though right now I absolutely hate his new relationship, I wouldn’t wish for this new person to be at risk. I don’t want it to happen to anyone. 

I don’t know what my next steps should be. I should reach out to this new person,  right? I am confident that he won’t tell them his status even if I ask him. I feel horrible about all of this.

Please help."

What if he has hiv and we have sex so many times that the medication doesn’t protect me from the hiv :/


&gt; What was strange about the 3rd and most recent case is that an older test returned HIV positive, while 2 newer tests returned HIV negative. The most reliable tools returned negative results. The man had a DIZZYING number of sex partners, and took every drug under the sun. They halted his PrEP to prevent a potential drug resistant strain to the virus. I don't know if this damned him or not.

When the newer tests finally came back positive, they were able to identify that the strain did not have prep-resistant mutations, which means theoretically it shouldn't have been able to get through.

My rudimentary understanding of science is that then you cohabitate with disease for long enough, it eventually takes hold - even if it's not technically supposed to. When the British didn't have proper sewer systems and swine, poultry, humans, and feces all occupied the same public space, the one in a million chance of an animal disease spreading to a human became a certainty.

This man's butthole was home to one million different loads on any given day, which means that it was eventually inevitable that something would break through. That's my take, anyway."

I try to avoid bisexual men to reduce the risk (yes I know straight men can have hiv too). I’m also in Washington DC which has a high hiv risk too. Like idk anyone who isn’t monogamous I feel they may have hiv."

This has been an overwhelming experience. I have a fiancé and a daughter 6 months old I was diagnosed yesterday after waiting a week for my second blood test to come.

As you all know this can be life shattering feeling. at first my fiancé is heart broken at possibly having to stop breast feeding, and for her and our child to possible have hiv.

Our saving grace which we can only hope for is that I never passed it on. her recent bloods showed she did not have hiv during pregnancy and has never shown flu like symptoms.

I on the other hand have been sick constantly for quite a few years unsure what was causing this I used to be so healthy.

This morning after I woke up I puked. our child is refusing the bottle my fiancé cried in the bathroom alone and things seem dreadful and the outlook looks bleak right now.

If by any luck she doesn’t have it, things won’t be as fucked up as they seem to be right now. I can’t feel sad in front of her because I’ve been told the only thing that changes is being medicated and I can live a long life with the only downside is I take 1 pill a night

She may possibly face never breast feeding again a judge full, Chinese family who criticise and have a very narrow view on things and will ask endless questions to why things have changed.

I’m not sure why I’m writing this. I feel like telling my story and venting, I’m praying to whatever entity is out there to have saved my child and fiancé from this life altering virus

Thank you for reading. I wish I was educated better and wasn’t so naive to sex as we probably all felt post diagnosis and I hope this transition and side effects ease off I feel like a sledgehammer has hit me."

I have been having a cough for several months. Its a tickle that is at my supersternal knot area and then goes just below the breastbone. I have a dry hacking/clearing throat type cough that completely goes away when I am sleeping or when I am distracted. Though it doesn’t fully go away when I am distracted but it does when I am sleeping. It does intensify when I am anxious or thinking about the cough. I have starter to produce very small amounts of clean phlegm that for the most part I cannot cough out completely and end up having to swallow it. When I tilt my head up I get a raspy barking type cough. I was a weed smoker and started smoking at the age of 15. Then got into daily smoking at age 16 or 17. I recently found out I am HIV+ in February and I am now undetectable with CD4 count of about 680. Since February, I quit smoking except for one or two days when I needed to smoke to calm my nerves about everything going on. I know I am at a higher chance of diseases including COPD because of those two risk factors. My cough is still dry but sometimes I do produce a very small amount of clear phlegm. I also have GERD but I have gone through the 4-week Omeprazole treatment and the cough got a little better but is still there. I have only had GERD for about 4-5 years. I am very scared that it might be early stages of COPD. Though I do not seem to be out of breathe when going up the stairs or up a hill and I have not gotten any fever. Plus no history of asthma and no hereditary lung diseases. Though my mom and dad have been cigarette smokers for 35+ years, they no problems so far at age 55. I also tested negative for COVID, so that is ruled out. Could I have COPD at 24-year-old even if I am HIV+? I know that COPD is not prevelant among my age group, though I am truely concerned and cannot get a peace of mind to even do my classes. My primary care physician is not letting me come in for examinations after me asking to. I have an at home spirometer trainer and I seem to do very well doing the exercise that is written in the manual. What do you think my cough might be? I was also thinking it might be habit cough, but that is rare in my age group as well. Could it be COPD or could it be something else? I have tried using Atrovent that mom’s friend gave me (she is a pulmonologist medical tech). It did not realy help my cough in the moment."

He asked what medications I take, and I said I take biotin (aka Hair Skin and Nails). He said there is a small chance that the biotin in those supplements can produce false negatives on HIV tests. An excerpt:

--The Determine™️ HIV-1/2 Combo test is manufactured using biotin technology. Therefore, Abbott conducted studies to further understand the potential for biotin to impact test results. The results of this study determined that no assay interference was observed with with biotin spiked HIV-1 or HIV-2 antibody samples or with presumed non-reactive serum and whole blood samples. However, interference was observed with P24 antigen samples at certain concentration levels: Two of 20, or 10% of samples, had false negative results for the P24 antigen in whole blood spiked with biotin at 150 ng/mL. Thirteen of 20, or 65% of samples, had false negative results for the P24 antigen in serum spiked with biotin at 150 ng/mL. --


I think my Hair, Skin and Nails supplements have 2500 mcg per serving. I have no idea how this would convert to ng/mL in my blood. I'm frustrated and scared. It's been 5 weeks since my last sexual partner, whose status is unknown (has not tested recently but was apparently HIV-negative as of 6 months ago.) 

Is there any amount of math that could possibly convert this to know how many ng/mL of biotin are in my blood because of these vitamins? 

I am going to stop taking them and test again in one or two weeks, however long it takes for the excess biotin to clear my system."

I (M 31) don't know if this is the right place to ask this question. And also please forgive my writing skills and for this long post. 

On 20th June 2020 , I was traveling to a different city by car. It was a hot and humid day. Just before reaching this city I stopped at the side of the road to pee as I really needed to pee badly. I know sounds gross. So I stop to the side of the road. It was a regular rural country road with the side of the road covered in grass and bushes at it's extreme ends. So I get down from the car and I was walking towards the bush to pee. As I was walking towards the bush I saw there were around 4-5 empty syringes lying on the grass at the side of the road. There was no blood in them as far as I can remember (or they might have been blood in some syringe and I didn't notice it). So I jumped over the syringes while walking towards the bush so as to not to come in contact with them. So I peed and came back to the car. All this time I was careful enough to not to come in contact with the syringes or to step on them accidentally or step on its needles. I am 99% sure that I did not have any needle stick injury , or that any needle punctured through the skin of my feet or any other part of my body. There was no sign of any injury or puncture wound or blood on my feet or any other part of my body coz I checked it. Is it possible that I may have accidentally pricked my foot with needle without noticing ?

Also I want to add that I was wearing flip flops at that time with a very thin sole.

So my question is are there any chances of me getting infected with HIV. Since past 2 weeks I'm freaking out about this incident , it's been playing in my mind over and over again. I'm suffering from depression because of this incident. I have lost my will to exercise and eat proper diet , basically don't feel like doing anything in life. I'm terrified that I may have been infected with HIV . I say this because since past 1 week I have noticed a slight increase in my body temperature and a slight weakness nothing else.

So is there any way I would have got infected with HIV ? 

That's all , Thank you."

icofcc,Hiv skin disorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/hivaids/comments/icofcc/hiv_skin_disorders/,LoveIsDear,1,2020-08-19 07:15:39,53,/r/hivaids/comments/icofcc/hiv_skin_disorders/,NaN,"Before learning I had Hiv I found a random dermatologist to assist me with some skin issues, who by the way was the person that told me I was Hiv positive. From my scalp and to the soles of my feet, she was able to identify that I had psoriasis and dandruff. Prescribed me a shampoo and steroid stuff to put in my head.

Okay, great. But the issue is she did a skin biopsy to determine what was wrong with my head and another with my body. The results for my body came back with nothing (mind you she did it on the arm). 

What pisses me off is that she prescribed me this ointment with steroids in it to help with keeping the irritation of my skin under control and some pills. But it’s done nothing, it works sometimes but I’m still suffering. 

The psoriasis hasn’t calmed down and feels as though it’s expanded, even with the keto shampoo and steroid stuff she gave me. My face  is very repulsive at this time, and even when I moisturize or put Vaseline on it, it barely does anything. I even started to develop some stuff behind the ears and hairline in the back and sides.

But my issue isn’t with the psoriasis and rashes on my face, that’s secondary. It’s the skin on my body. She pretty much never diagnosed me on that and I had to find my own, somewhat affordable, Hiv Specialist to help me. My skin feels like it’s worsening and the itching is barely being halted by the prescribed pills and steroids. 

I’m too appalled to look at myself or my body, led alone take pictures. But it looks pretty much like Lichen Planus or Prurigo Nodularis. I decided to do a bit of research on African American people with hiv who suffer from this syndrome/side effect of hiv.

Apparently, what I learned, is that  Prurigo Nodularis is common within People of Color who have been diagnosed with Hiv. What pisses me off is that she didn’t diagnose this because nothing from the skin biopsy showed anything. So she just pretty much said fuck it and gave me some stuff to keep it tamed, which isn’t helping.  And I’m not saying she didn’t do her job or try hard enough ( technically she didn’t, I don’t think she had experience working with African American patients. I found this dermatologist on a whim upon Zocdoc because I was suffering and couldn’t take it anymore. She was the only physician available.) She didn’t even schedule a follow up appointment or anything. Even when she told me I was hiv positive it’s like she didn’t even care and just pretty much tossed me onto someone else to become their problem.

I started my Hiv treatment last week and have been taking Itraconazole, some hydroxyzine and that’s about it. But it feels like no one is trying to help me with my skin issues. I feel like I may have to take an aggressive approach and admit myself into a hospital for all of this because I’m suffering and it’s causing my to have suicidal ideations.

It’s dangerous for me to be alone or in my room right now. So tomorrow I’m going to visit my ID because I have to get a shot in the butt for gonorrhea and chlamydia, but I’m going to see if I can be admitted for a little while because my skin is so bad and irritated and a mess. I’m just so tired of spending money on all these expensive medications and shit. 

I just want someone to give a fuck and help me maintain this skin issue. I’m fucking suffering dude. So hopefully I can be admitted for a little while and they provide me a doctor who knows what they’re doing. 

I’m just so sad because I haven’t had the need for a doctor in YEARS, and the minute I contract Hiv BOOM back to back visits. This fucking sucks and I miss my old self. I don’t even know who I am anymore. I’m so depressed."

Is there any possibility that this could be early stages HIV? I am going to get tested but I’ve heard it’s too early at the moment. I am worried sick and just wanted some advice in case there is a chance I just have a bug of some kind."

I am excited to begin volunteering next week on the medical team in an HIV clinic.  I know a lot about the virus itself from being a genetics major, so I'm looking for advice on how to help patients w/ the emotional aspect.  I have a chronic viral STI too, so I feel I can relate well to the psychological impact (it sent me through the ringer lol) , but I suppose what I'm asking is what you guys would have liked someone to have told you when you were first diagnosed.  also, I live in the Deep South where the stigma around HIV is more prevalent, what can I say to reassure patients and remind them that they are more than the virus (as cheesy as it sounds)?

Also, shameless plug:  I created a sexual wellness instagram page a week ago (@thesexualwellnessclub) and one of topics that I have and will continue to focus on is HIV.  show it some love if you want!"

I wanted to ask how can one help increase and build T cell? I started my medication a week or 2 ago, and I’m slightly starting to feel somewhat better. Strong somewhat, the rash and ankle joint pain is are still there and may take a long time to go away. But I wanted to know if there’s any other way to build my T cell count to help decrease viral load. I’ve been constantly and proudly taking my medicine. And doing a bit of knee exercises due to my right knee slowly being drained of fluid ( gonorrhea ) and trying to stay off my left ankle. 

I’ve been given a lot of medication to help prevent, decrease and stop any fungal infections and potential bacteria.

Other than that I just wanna know, outside of exercising, is there anything else i can do while still bedridden to help increase my T cell and heal my horrific rash and other symptoms. I slowly feel myself getting better, keyword is slowly, but my rash isn’t irritating me too much. The only downside is that it’s still pretty bad but I think it’s slowly fading??? I don’t know I’m on a lot of medication so maybe that’s helping as well outside of my Dovato.

But again I’m just here to learn and receive some advice. You’ve all been so helpful and I appreciate everyone who’s reached out to me. It’s been great for my mental health as I deal with all of this.

P.S: I learned this week that my T cell count is below 200. Like it’s currently 47, or was like I said I’ve been taking my Dovato. In case any of you were curious about my CD4."

In my early twenties I was the one who touted “ah there’s plenty of kids in the world” or “I probably will never want or have them”. But my human instinct to procreate is kicking in. Also my friends, siblings, cousins, are all now having kids, it really puts you into gear. Although I have a long road to go before I believe I‘d be “ready” to have kids.

First, a 4th generation screening test for HIV-1and 2 antibodies, and p24 antigen is performed, using a **chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA)** (Abbott HIV Ag/Ab Combo Assay performed on the Abbott Architect instrument), or a 3rd generation immunochromatographic card (Trinity Biotech Unigold) assay is used.

I was admitted in the hospital because I had pneumonia. I thought it was COVID, but I test negative 3 times. So they prescribed me to do a sputum test to see what bacteria got into my lungs, when the results got out, it was a PJP infection. My doctor told me to do HIV screening, because it wasn’t normal for my age (btw, I’m 26) to have that infection. After someone extracted my blood, a few hours later my doctor told me my results, I was reactive to the virus. No one from the hospital handed me my screening results. After two days, I got out of the hospital and I still haven’t got my screening results. The hospital also didn’t do my CD4 count test, and prescribed to do it on my own. So I did, even though my body is still weak. After I got my CD4 count results, I transferred to another hospital and got a new doctor and when I showed him my CD4 count results, he told me that I was suffering AIDS (my CD4 count was 87). Cried a lot, but nothing stopped to be healthy again. Few weeks later I got a call from previous hospital that I can get my screening results from them. I got to talk to the counselor and she didn’t interpret my screening results. I got reactive for HIV-1 and HIV-2, I didn’t know what it means. I googled it but most of the search results are medical journals and it was too scientific for me to understand. 

I got a lot questions, but I leave this one question here: Is it possible for someone to get infected with HIV-1 and HIV-2?

PS: sorry for the long intro. I just want you to understand my story."

Symptoms have been very mild. In fact, I was on antibiotics and thought they were the side effects. But yesterday started losing sense of smell, not fully but noticeably. Went and got tested and was positive. I believe I've had it for 10 days now. I did get sore throat one day; chill, mild fever, mild body aches for about 4 days. Moderate sinus pressure too. Dry couch a couple of times a day for about 4 days too. All and all pretty mild, truly. And again, I didn't even pay attention. Thought it was the antibiotics.

For reference, my CD4 was around 830 about 1 month ago.

And it's funny because I've been self-isolating the most in this precise period. But I did have sex with this guy. And he had traveled to Palm Springs and San Diego. I asked him casually a few days ago, and he denied having symptoms very strongly. Told him today that had tested positive, and that I'm sure it came from him. Guy went on a rampage of fake apologizing ""for only me having gotten sick."" Told me I shouldn't go around trying to blame people. The funny thing is I didn't do any of that. Just told him inequivocally that I was positive and that I was certain it came from him, mostly for him to be aware and self-isolate. Well, told me he works with 20 people every day and none of them have it, just me. Wish I had known! Brought back memories of getting infected with HIV. So I just blocked him after his passive-aggressive comments. Ain't nobody got time for that.

I had also had sex with this early 20s kid I really like 3 days ago after I ended my antibiotics. And I just told him about covid. Seemed like the right thing to do. I wouldn't want him to spread it, especially to his family, whom I know he visits sometimes.

Just wanted to share as I know there's interest in the community."

To gain my residence permit, I had to undergo a medical examination. After repeated visits to the medical facility, I was told by one of the doctors that I had tested positive for HIV. I had no time to process my feelings or deal with this news. I was in a country where I did not belong, alone and isolated. The next day my employer terminated my employment agreement and within twenty four hours of being diagnosed with HIV, I was being deported back to my home country. I lost everything I had worked towards for my entire professional career in a single moment. 

Out of the 48 countries and territories that maintain HIV related travel restrictions, at least 30 still impose bans on entry or stay and residence based on HIV status and 19 deport non-nationals on the grounds of their HIV status.
Mandatory HIV testing and bans on entry, stay and residence based on HIV status not only do not protect public health but undermine HIV prevention and treatment efforts. For millions of people living with HIV around the world, these are repeated violations of their right to privacy, equality and non-discrimination and a constant reminder of HIV-related stigma. 

The Cayman Islands and the Turks and Caicos Islands (both UK Overseas Territories) as well as Aruba (a Dutch Territory), Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Saint Kitts and Nevis and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are all Caribbean islands that still have some form of HIV related travel restrictions. These islands require HIV testing for work and study permits and for residency. Isn't it time to change this and promote positive foreign policies? I am from the Caribbean and I am trying to make a change in my region. I think if we can get this done maybe we can get more countries to become more inclusive and reduce the harm done by HIV-related stigma.

I have launched a petition on Change.org to get help from the public and hopefully push lawmakers to act. I would truly appreciate your help in promoting my petition to your team and stakeholders so we can get some more people on board. Please visit the site below and pledge your support.

Travel restrictions based on HIV status fuel stigma against people living with, at risk of and affected by HIV. They can create a misleading public impression that HIV is a foreign problem and therefore interfere with the efficacy of public health messages on the prevention of HIV.

According to UNAIDS, restrictions on entry, stay and residence based on HIV status are discriminatory and cannot be justified on public health grounds. Everyone should have equal freedom of movement regardless of their HIV status. There is no evidence that HIV-related travel restrictions protect public health. In fact, they are likely to impede efforts to protect public health by creating barriers to access to services for people living with HIV and people at higher risk of HIV.

Travel restrictions related to HIV status may impair access to antiretroviral therapy, especially in countries and areas where access to treatment, care and support programmes and services is limited.

There is no evidence that people living with HIV will engage in riskier behaviours than people who are not living with HIV. Most countries in the world do not have or have lifted their HIVrelated restrictions on entry, stay and residence. Those that have lifted HIV-related restrictions have found no need to re-adopt such measures.  

UNAIDS opposes mandatory HIV testing and restrictions that limit or restrict movement based on an HIV-positive status. There is no scientific or public health evidence to support people living with HIV and people living with other chronic health conditions, such as chronic heart or liver diseases, diabetes or cancer, being treated differently."

My BF caught HIV. We used protection, but I did engage in oral sex (receiving from him). He says he caught it in February. We had sex in june, only oral. Anal sex sometime between the two months, with me being on top wearing a condom. 

No breaks or tears in condom. How likely is it that I caught it? I took one of those fast take home tests and it came back negative. But I know those can give false negatives. 

He was most likely latent during the periods we had sex, can you catch HIV from someone who is latent? 

How many months does it take till HIV builds up enough in a persons body to spread it?

So  as the title says, yesterday I had sex with a hooker. At her place we  started fucking with a condom, she used a water based lube and the  condom fitted good so I guess everythings fine with that. then i  proceeded to eat her out, she looked and smelled very clean and no other  fluid to fluid contact happened besides that. Now my concern is,  because i have a tiny sore on the inside of my upper lips, that there  might've happened a HIV-transmission through her vaginal fluid (she  wasnt craaazy wet but I really went ham on that thing), I was careful  during sex, to only use my tongue and not my lips so the sore wouldnt  open which didnt happen so theres no chance, that hiv entered my  bloodstream through this tiny sore right? my paranoia kept going till  today where I talked with her and asked, if she ever had unprotected sex  with clients and she told me she would never do something like that,  regardless of how much money somebodys offering and that she gets  checked on everything every 3 months (even showed me her test which was  negative on everything). she told me that this is her job and she takes  hygiene very seriously and that she only has one body and her business  would be ruined if she would get infected by hiv or some kinda shit,  this sounded really logical for me. Though I was still paranoid and kept  googling all kinds of stuff regarding hiv and I read, that theres  basically no chance for HIV to enter your body through vaginal fluid in  your mouth, because there cant be enough HIV in the vaginal fluid for an  infection, even if you have an open sore in your mouth your saliva  kills the virus off, only ejaculation in mouth is dangerous for the  woman. I even talked to a friend, who told me that I shouldnt overthink  that much, because theres practically no chance for an hiv infection, if  I used a condom and even without, theres still a really slim chance for  transmission.

It ended up longer  than I wanted it to be but thats my current situation. can you guys help  me calm down or in the worst case even wake me up to go see a doctor or  something. Im really struggling to focus on life right now, because I  cant think about anything else other than this possible or maybe not  possible hiv infection. please help me.

kind regards"

I have been battling bipolar for ages now. PTSD from childhood sexual assaults. Body dysmorphia. Multiple suicide attempts and hospital admissions. Panic attacks. A demanding career. A homophobic society. Was just diagnosed with HIV less than half a year ago. 

Despite all of this, I feel lucky.

Positive thinking isn’t something u can just will yourself to do. After I and my last therapist nearly tried every drug in the book and literally had to be a walking pharmacy just to function. He asked me: “If u were to get in a car accident and lose the function of your legs, what will u do?” I immediately answered: “I’ll just kill myself”. He asked: “why do u think most ppl don’t?” I said: “because they’re idiots hanging on to a flimsy hope of being normal again, or they know to settle for less or are just pussies that can’t take themselves out.” He said: “Well, you’re still here, are u a pussy?” ( It actually was a more vulgar word in our local dialect). I said: “ofc not!” He said: “Neither are they. You all just have different obstacles. You also have something deep down driving you to want to wake up every morning. U just see things differently. That person may feel the happiest they’ve been even in a seemingly hopeless situation. They just think of the smallest wiggle of their toes as an achievement. You should acknowledge the harshness of whatever bad situation u may find yourself in. Mental/physical illness are not the norm. Getting to seem normal while dealing with that is an extraordinary feat. Give yourself credit and celebrate these small successes” 

I don’t know why that stuck with me, but I’m glad it did. 

Examining my situation now with a different lens. I can see some light in the darkness that once threatened to extinguish it. Focusing on that light just makes it grow bigger. Yes! I was diagnosed with HIV. But I happen to be a physician and got a chance to catch it early unlike many unfortunate others. It threatened to kill my career, and when homelessness or having to live with my family were actual prospects that my mind had drawn for me, I was assured of my humanity again and had my worries laid to rest by an amazing doctor that happened to have a masters in medical law and worked in the same hospital I work in. Most importantly, I thought for sure my partner was positive. After all, we’ve been together more than 2 years. It robbed sleep from our eyes and just nearly crushed us. He tested negative and still does and we couldn’t be crazier about each other. I know I’m lucky in about a hundred other ways that I won’t bother u with and a thousand other ways that I still can’t appreciate or put into words. 

I’m in no way trying to preach a new view of life. Life is full of hardships, bad people and injustice. But it’s also filled with kindness, science and love. You just gotta be lucky to see this. I’ve got a feeling this subreddit is full of lucky people.

I hope that my story helped someone. 

And to the English teachers reading this, I apologize for the run on sentences and grammatical errors😅.


For people in this subreddit dealing with mental illness and recently developed HIV. How well are u coping with the HIV diagnosis? Have u noted improvement with ART? and did u need to change your meds (psych meds/ART)?"

I met a guy, thought he was attractive. After chatting for a few days we met up. I'm negative, not on prep. He told me he was negative and on prep. While messing around (him straddling me) he kept trying to force my dick in him without a condom. He was successful 2 times but I kept pulling it out. I constantly asked him about condoms but he said he didn't have any and that he was negative and on prep. I didn't actually top him because I wasn't going to without protection. I found it weird that he didn't have condoms and in just meeting me for the first time that he would be so trusting to force me dick in him. 

I met up with him a second time with condoms this time. I asked him again about his status, he told me he was negative and on prep but he kept the prep at his job because he doesn't want anyone to find it. Mind you, he lives alone. My instincts were now on high alert because I found out that he also was 5 years older than he told me initially. 

I asked him to send me a pic of the prep bottle when he got to work. He didn't. He met up with me and showed me the pills. When I googled they were biktarvy which isn't for hiv prevention but treatment. When confronted about it he got visibly nervous and agitated and asked me to leave his car because I was stressing him out. 

I got tested 2 weeks after the exposure and I'm negative. While I didn't top him per say, my penis was still in him raw for 3 seconds or less. The dishonesty could have had catastrophic effects. Now I'm grappling with whether or not to report him to the authorities (I'm in Florida). Things like this can damage someone's health. He blatantly lied and put me in harm's way.

The HIV advocacy place here uses Medicaid/Medicare to get people their meds and if I’d kept my job, I would have lost that. So falling back on my SSDI, I couldn’t afford to live on my own anymore and had to move back in with my family.

Living with them was TERRIBLE! Since I’d told them I had HIV, they were constantly worried about me infecting them. Mind you I was undetectable before I even moved back home. They made me live in the garage (which got VERY cold in the winter, but I had my own bathroom at least. I couldn’t eat with them. Any time got a cut or scrape they’d freak out. I tried to educate them but they refused to listen to me or read anything my doctors sent home. Eventually, the segregation got to everyone. My niece assaulted me while I was playing video games with her stepdad and her boyfriend. Just because she decided she wanted to sit where I was sitting and didn’t respect me enough to ask me to move. I got a busted lip, and then I was kicked out on the street.

After that, I was a lot less forward with people about my condition. Only the closest people to me know. My boyfriend (of 5 years now), my two best friends whose family unofficially adopted me after the above incident, and my best friends’ mom. My boyfriend and I agreed to never tell his parents or his friends. So I’m basically back in the closet. No one but my doctors and my boyfriend to talk to about this stuff. Tbh it makes me really grateful that you all are here."

Hello,

I am looking for LGBTQIA+ community members who would be open to participating in a short interview for a UC Berkeley undergraduate media research project. The project will look at how media representations have influenced perceptions of social behavior among members of the LGBTQIA+ communities – with a particular focus on how public health communications during this time of COVID-19 has been affected by the legacy of the early years of the AIDS pandemic. I am seeking out perspectives from adults who came of age during the peak of the AIDS crisis to better understand how those experiences compare to or differ from today. However, this project covers a broad scope, and all participants are invited to share their experiences (with sex education in school, mass media, coming out stories, etc.). 

Each conversation will be about 30-40 minutes, conducted over Zoom, and recorded for transcription. **I am completely aware and understanding of the potentially sensitive information that may be involved, so confidentiality and privacy will be honored and respected.** As this is solely for a media research project for a student course, the content **will not** be used for publication or use beyond this class. 

I can provide a fully detailed description of the project, and the parameters of participation (consent form, info on confidentiality, voluntary option to withdraw at any time, terms of usage, etc.) upon request.

A little information about me: 

I am a gay, male, Media Studies undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley. 

I hope you will consider this interview/conversation. Please reach out to me anytime with questions.

Thank you and be safe,

Eddie Vidales

Now I have a little bit flu-like symptoms and at the left neck of me is feeling like swollen lymph nodes. Also, my mouth is very dry.

I had rushed to a doctor to make an HIV blood test 15 hours after the Sex in which nothing was seen. The test was negative.

The window period is 4 weeks to 90 days. I will have another HIV blood test in 4 weeks.

According to the CDC, getting HIV from a woman is very low. Only 4 of 10.000 People are getting it.

Fast forward to now. I’ve been having aches in my testicles. I went to the doctor and he has put me on antibiotics. He found blood in my urine a a high cell count. He was asking about my sex life. He said it would be rare I would get anything and show these symptoms now from February. But after all this has happened I am worried. My first ever sexual encounter and I am shitting it.

Will my urine sample show anything? He said he’s sending it off for testing."

I have some questions that I could use some help with.

First, I'm HIV positive. Have been for 5 years. Undetectable, stigma, therapy, support groups, self-worth, blah blah blah. A lot of us here already know a similar story. I'm glad for this space to talk about it, too.

Since Covid changed everything, I've decided to try to get my shit together a bit. I never finished college because I've been directionless for most of my adult life, but lately I've wanted to find a way to help others the way I was helped when I found out my status.

There was a series of people to sort of saved my life.The woman in the testing bus who waited with me while I wept. The doctor at Planned Parenthood who confirmed my diagnosis, gave me some facts about the disease. The volunteer on the HIV crisis line who talked with me for a few days to make sure I was getting the help I needed. The caseworker who help me get insurance, and ADAP coverage. The sweetheart who worked in member services at Kaiser, who performed some bureaucratic magic to cover the costs of my copays and dental insurance through the state. That's not to mention people traveling internationally, working with organizations that help treat and manage this disease all over the world in underserved populations - incredible.

THE QUESTION: 
Does anyone here have experience being somewhere in this line of helpful people who help someone with HIV? There's a huge, global network of people fighting this disease. I'd like to hear their story: how you chose to do this work, the educational and career path that lead you there, and any suggestions on where I could start.

Hi everyone! I am currently getting close to be enrolled in a clinical trail for a adenovirus-vector COVID-19 (Chinese’s x). Doing some research, I found this worrisome article at The Lancet. Seems like an HIV attempted adenovirus based vaccine a decade ago created a circumstance where uncircumcised men had actually higher chances of infection with no HIV protection whatsoever. It seems the risk is limited to insertive activity. The article does not clarifies if this is a situation exclusive to HIV vaccines (hence a possibility of Antibody-dependent enhancement) or a problem with all and every single vaccine based on an adenovirus vector (both Aztra Zeneca and Pfizer vaccines are using adenovirus as their vector). 

I am a young cis gay man on PrEP, but it still worries me a little of participating in the trial could put me at risk of enhancing sensibility to HIV infection, specially when I could just wait for a vaccine that’s not using adenovirus vectors like CoronaVac or Moderna’s vaccine. 


Anyone has any thoughts on this? I would really appreciate it!"

I started quite late at 62 hours post exposure and am going crazy over the fact that my life may have changed irreversibly and there’s nothing I can do about it . 

I just want to know if anyone has been through this and come out positive so I can use the remaining 20 days to mentally prepare myself for the rest of my life . 

It was such an unfortunate string of bad decisions. Having lots of coffee before drinking that led me to seriously underestimate how drunk I was, that led me to that point. In bed with a stranger. Having unprotected sex . Unconscious for most of it . And then being the eternal optimist I thought said stranger would eventually agree to do the self test so I wasted 2.5 days calling him and begging him to meet me for the test. 

In hindsight I should have gone straight to hospital the morning after . 

Now I have no choice but to live with the consequences.

So, I was talking with my dad about my former job at a HIV detection clinic. And for some reason I remembered a “interesting” story. So one day I took a cab to work, I usually drove. The driver was a mature man and he started chatting with me, eventually he asked me about my work and I told him what a I did at the time (I wasn’t comfortable discussing my diagnosis with a complete stranger, specially not one that were driving around the city). So this dude, in a as-matter-of-fact voice started ranting about how HIV wasn’t real, that ARV therapy was a scam that produced AIDS, that the WHO were in cahoots with the Illuminati, and all that Jazz. 
Y I K E S. I found not worth it to discuss it (dangerous even, as the cab syndicate in my city is a well know mafia)so I just nodded in silence and waited until I arrived at my destination as I wasn’t far away from it.

So, my question is, has the whole HIV hoax “theory” affected you or people you know?

Do you think is a product of stigmatization or extreme denial? 

What can we do to prevent a resurge in HIV denialism?

Did some research about hiv stages and I found out that there are 3 with 3 subcategories, usually differentiated by CD4 and symptoms:

Stage A - asymptomatic, where we can find A1; A 2 and A3
Stage B - symptomatic, with subcategories B1; B2 and B3
Stage C - symptomatic (more symptoms and infections than stage B) with C1; C2 and C3

I read that stages A3, B3 and C3 are considered AIDS, with CD 4 less than 200. The papers said that once diagnosed with A3, B3 or C3 stage or AIDS you couldn't move to another category.

But I found nothing on changing your diagnosis between stage B2 and B1 or B2 and A1.

So, my question is: if you are diagnosed with HIV infection B2 stage, let's say, could you, after treatment move into another category like B1?

Or the stage of your infection stays the same, regardless of your cd4 number and other infections that you no longer have, like the AIDS diagnosis?

Thank you for your input and time.
Hugs"

Maybe I am in placebo control group what makes me sad because too much effort for water and salt.

47 days ago on a weekend I had casual penetrative vaginal sex with two women at different times. I used condoms both times and when I finished we made sure that it was in good condition, it didn’t break or something like that, but i didn’t fill it with water to make sure, i never do.

 I made oral sex to one of them and I fingered both of them, I bite my nails maybe this put me in risk, but doctors told me is very very low risk.

But 17 days after those encounters I felt feverish (99.4 F Armpit Temperature), i had fatigue (I stayed in bed for a few hours), i had a headache (strong) and muscle pain, but these symptoms lasted 1 day and a half, maybe two days max. Now i feel good and i don’t have any symptoms! Yesterday I noticed a little bump on my armpit, maybe it a swollen node i don’t know. Oh! It was not COVID what happened because I tested negative.

&amp;#x200B;

I called an HIV/STD organization in my city and I explained my case to them and they told me to be calm, that there is nothing to worry about! But I don’t usually get sick so I don’t know.

&amp;#x200B;

NEXT Tuesday on *December 1* (**World AIDS/HIV Day**, what a coincidence, right?), I have an appointment for a HIV *4th Generation* Exam at the hospital in city in Madrid (Europe). I waited this long so I have a good window period. I will receive the results after 5-6 days, so i will have to wait.

&amp;#x200B;

I am afraid but I have to be strong, the wisest thing is to take the exam. I can't sleep well at night, I regret my actions. I know there is no cure but with the new advances in medicine it is possible to live a decent and healthy life. Getting tested is the greatest act of self-love that i can do to myself. I know I will be fine, public health care is good in Spain and I know that my family will never abandon me.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s world AIDS day tomorrow and since Covid-19 has revealed the hypocrisy around these diseases, and I think it’s time we talk about it.

First let’s talk about numbers:
The highest number of HIV/AIDS related deaths in Canada occurred in 1995 with a death toll of 1,764 people. Alternatively, Over its first year coronavirus has claimed 11,894 lives in Canada.

Now, let’s look at the global numbers; globally 690k people died from AIDS-related illnesses in 2019. Coronavirus has doubled this number at 1.44 million global deaths in its first year.

Ok so, what about transmission? Well, did you know that HIV is actually treatable AND preventable? Did you know it has been proven that people on HIV medication have a 0% chance of transmitting the virus to anyone, through any type of contact. Did you know there is a very minimal amount of ways HIV can actually be passed to another person? Or that HIV is actually an extremely weak virus that dies when outside the human body, especially if it comes into contact with regular soap?

Now let’s discuss COVID-19 transmission. Heck, we don’t even have a full understanding or grasp of this virus, but what we do know is that it’s highly contagious. Surely based on what we do know it’s safe to say that COVID is more deadly and easier to spread/catch than HIV.

Yet over 28% of millennials have stated they would avoid coming into contact with someone who is HIV positive, and the numbers in the older generations are much higher. So why are the same people out breathing raw, refusing to wear masks or take COVID seriously because they think it can’t affect them. So while you’re out at social gatherings or refusing to wear a mask while stigmatizing those with HIV, just keep in mind that your hypocrisy is showing.

The worst part of HIV is the stigma. 68,000 Canadians live with HIV, 14% of whom are unaware of their HIV status. Help destigmatize HIV by educating yourself and getting tested regularly.

I've been battling porn addiction and regular porn just wouldn't do it anymore for me. I started watching a bunch of different porn categories, including gay blowjobs. Whenever I got horny, I would reach for porn, different type of fetishes in straight porn ( like foot fetish which I didn't have before porn addiction ) and gay porn.

My friend came over 4 days ago. He turned on porn and one thing led to another and we gave each other handjobs and blowjobs.

This made me sure that I am not gay. It wasnt a bad experience, but I regretted it immediately after I came and post-nut clarity came in. I realized I only did it because of being super horny due to watching porn and being a teen + having 0 contact with other people and 0 relationships and being lonely for 13 months since my last big breakup.

I just regret it so much. I shouldn't have done it. But, one thing that bothers me more is HIV. Could I have gotten it from giving and recieving a blowjob? I asked him before we had oral, and he told me he never had any type of sex with another person before this. I wouldn't be surprised, as he isn't the most charming or hot guy and he claims he is straight ( this was just experimenting for him ) and he can't pull girls easily.

Should I worry about getting HIV? I am not worrying about other STDs because even if I get them, I can cure them. I am worried about HIV so much though. I can't even sleep properly. I wish I could get back in time and never do that."

The highly infectious novel coronavirus has swept across the world, devastating health systems and laying waste to economies as governments introduce drastic measures to contain the spread. Not since the HIV/AIDS pandemic of the 1990s have countries faced such a common health threat. Around 33 Mmillion people worldwide have died from AIDS-related illnesses in the last 40 years. It's taken incredible expertise, collaboration and dedication from all levels of society to track, understand, treat and prevent the illness. Although HIV/Aids hasn't been eradicated, the global response is in many respects a shining example of what can be achieved when countries and people work together.

We are a research group from UNC-Chapel Hill dedicated to conducting technology-based research on all aspects of sexual health, and have created an app called **Tough Talks** designed to utilize virtual-reality based simulations to allow young people living with HIV to practice disclosing their status to sexual partners in a safe space. This isn't intended to get people to disclose their status to everyone in their life, but rather to help them decide who to disclose to, how to do it, and how to prepare for the outcome. 

The whole app consists of four sections each focused on a different aspect of disclosure.  Utilizing choose-your-own-adventure style games, informational and skills-building activities, and virtual-reality disclosure sessions, users can practice disclosing their status to avatars representing real-life people in different scenarios, experiencing a wide variety of outcomes from support, acceptance, confusion, and rejection.

I have a friend in prison who was recently given a job doing kitchen work which was then later taken away due ""health issues related to a bloodborne pathogen"". This was literally related to his HIV status and nothing else. My friend is medicated, undetectable, and knows that their reasoning is archaic bullshit. He's filed grievances about it, but is hoping that I can help him find some additional resources(specific laws that make it illegal for them to discriminate against him, easily citable studies for U=U that he can reference). I'm not sure where to begin and could use some pointers on where to begin looking. This is in New Jersey if it matters.

Thank you!"

I wrote a comment myself about the fact that it should *never* take specialists to diagnose HIV because HIV testing should be done universally as part of routine care.

Lots of discussion among doctors (and other healthcare workers) about HIV testing and diagnosis, but very little from PLWH.  

I thought some of you might be interested in the thread and want to add your voices.  It's here:

A lot of doctors read Meddit comments, so if there's something you want doctors to know, write a comment!  

Especially for those who were diagnosed later than they should have been due to physician incompetence, it's a good place to share your story."

Came here because of some cervical lesions I have because of HPV. I've seen 2 doctors to decide on a treatment. 

Today I was at the best clinic in the country, had an appointment with one of the best doctors there are for cervical lesions and/or cervical cancer.

The doctor told me plain sight that she recommended me to make more investigations regarding my HIV positive status. Saying that my CD4 are in range, I don't have a compromised immune system and the treatment for HIV probably Will kill me before the disease. 

Told me that more people die because of the treatment than they die because of HIV. 

Told me that Luc Montagnier could have discovered something else, not HIV and the treatment is more dangerous than the illness itself. 

Told me that the one who discovered PCR test (Mullis?) Was Very sarcastic in its comments regarding the possibility to diagnose viruses by a PCR test.

Basically she suggested to stop treatment and have more investigations about my status. 

Regardless to say, how shocked I was. In fact I was spacing out at some time, in the middle of the conversation... 

What's the proper reaction when a country renowned doctor denies your HIV status, even though her specialisation is not infectious diseases? 

Did you met similar doctors?

Should I trust this doctor with my cervical problems?

Thanks guys for your support and letting me vent here..."

What is missing from this study, however (as is sometimes the case with research &amp; writing on HIV), is an analysis that contextualizes these findings within paradigms of class and race. 

The study referenced in the article adjusts its findings for age, sex, and region (though it is concerned with New York state, so the study doesn't deal with the way HIV circulates nationally, which is also important). It **does not** take into account class OR race, two demographic paradigms that have a much stronger bearing on health outcomes than age or sex or region. 

It is important to hold in abeyance results from studies like this because its preliminary and insufficiently contextualized findings make implications about HIV that could—and in all likelihood DO—have more to do with other factors (like income, wealth, access to healthcare, and where these intersect with race) which require more imminent mitigation.

Studies like this become mobilized in all sorts of public health debates and campaigns, influencing the state response to an ongoing, acute health threat. Before we position HIV as a particular comorbidity (especially during an active pandemic), it behooves us to be sure that the implications of such a claim are rooted unilaterally in issues caused by HIV and not other economic/environmental/historical challenges."

Yet we can also celebrate major success in the fight against a different global viral scourge: HIV.

During my medical training in the 1980s, hospital wards were often filled with people dying of HIV. Since then, antiviral treatments have dramatically transformed the diagnosis of HIV infection or AIDS from a death sentence to a chronic illness. A normal lifespan is no longer unusual among people living with HIV. And preventive measures described below have reduced the number of people becoming infected in the first place. Since the 1980s peak of new HIV infections, the number of people with newly diagnosed HIV in the US has fallen by more than two-thirds.

I'm a 22yo openminded boy from Turkey. I'm HIV+ for 2 years now. I am all good, healty. Mentally perfect, hahah. Anyway, here we have free medication for patients. I just met one guy from a group who are HIV+ from Turkey, and we became good friends. 

I wanted to share this post because I wonder how is being HIV+ in other countries. I know it still is a taboo almost everywhere. I tried to find groups from other countries to have friends,but I couldnt find. 

So, I am hoping here I will meet some of you. Either HIV+ or not, I would like to meet and talk about this topic. I am really eager to make friends about this."

She said the initial screening was positive but the 2nd test was negative and that I needed to give them more blood to do a 3rd test. For the past 48 hours I have been feeling so much stress over this thinking that my life is forever scarred and doomed. I've done a lot of learning and research to learn that living with HIV isn't as bad as I thought, but I've still been super stressed out.

I've been very depressed lately and have been feeling nauseous, light headed, and constipated for the past couple of days now and it's only got way worse in the past 48 hours. I don't know if it's symptoms from HIV kicking in, Covid, or just emotional stress and trauma. All I know is that I feel terrible and can't bring myself to go to my family for help as it's Christmas and I don't want to ruin their holiday. 

I've been taking tums, eating and drinking water a good amount, I had been exercising everyday or so the past couple of weeks so I don't know why I'm feeling so physically sick right now. It's not even confirmed that I am HIV positive but in my head it essentially is and it's killing me on the inside. I don't know where else to post this, I don't know if this is appropriate. I just want some comfort from people I feel like can relate. :c"

Also, a thing that definitely worth a mention, is that i cannot cure progressed AIDS.

But feel no fear; we have the Black Seeds (as mentioned in the Bible, and the Quran ) to take care of that, and can easily be bought though ebay, or your local health-store."

Tuesday, in the early morning, I got a blowjob on Grindr. I didn't cum or anything and I didn't reciprocate. We also made out in between.

 Wednesday, I get the first symptom of a sore throat and think aw fuck maybe it's covid (I had it in early december). 

Then on Thursday morning, I had a fever of 100.3 and went to go get a COVID test. Went to the clinic to talk to the doctor about a possible HIV screening (went through a lot last year cause I was paranoid), and he said sure. They gave me the paperwork and I got my test done.

Yesterday, or Friday, nothing really changed but my face was red (could be from standing in the sun for so long waiting for the covid test) and i felt like i was seeing a rash develop. Also my temp was ranging from 99.0-99.4

Today, I woke up and noticed I am starting to get a rash on my arms and somewhat on my chest. I still have a sore throat as well. In between yesterday and today, naps included, I would wake up with sweaty legs. I do not know whether to attribute that to night sweats, cause that's a symptom as well. However, if it was night sweats, wouldn't have my face been fine? 

Also the tip of my penis kinda hurts when i touch it and when i peed this morning as well. That started today."

I was just diagnosed as HIV positive two days ago. Traumatized (mostly by the stigma) but I think I  grieved enough these two days. I have been reading a lot of the posts on this sub and it has been very helpful. Thank you everyone contributing. 

I realized I didn't have much information as what to do now. Is there a website or guide or book that you think covers how it is living with HIV? (including everyday life, what tests are there, what medications, mental issues and others) I know i can talk with my doctor about this but I want to be as informed as i can. 

I know life hasn't dealt me good cards but i want to play this game as best as I can without letting this define me. Have a wonderful day!"

This post might seem a little redundant and I’m not entirely sure if the guidelines accept me talking about this here but:

In July 2019 at 19 years old I was sexually assaulted and 3 weeks later suffered a very harsh seroconversion that left me extremely weak and in a very very bad state. I dropped to 40kg and I almost expired.

It’s been a year and a bit since then and I’m not having too much trouble anymore. My viral load which was initially 30 million, is now fully and safely undetectable. 

My only issues are finding people who have gone through something similar, or are HIV+. Dating often feels draining as most people aren’t always fully clued up.

I did not know the person from before so I'm assuming him as positive.

Me being the insertive (used condom), gave him anal oral and fingered him(torn cuticles, not fresh or bleeding). At 20 days I started having throat uncomfort, No swollen lymph nodes, no fever, no rash, no fatigue, no muscle pains or aches.

I tested HIV gen 3 at 15 days (I know gen 3 It's not reliable at that time but I needed peace of mind and it was a free test) Result: Negative.

I tested at 18 days 4th gen DUO at a LAB. Result: Negative

I tested again at 20 days 4th gen DUO (cassette, rapid testing). Result:negative

I tested PCR at 19 days and I'm still waiting on the results since they come back positive at 10+ days and the lab told me these results are 99% conclusive.

I contacted a specialized HIV/AIDS testing clinic where I tested at 20 days and the social worker told me my 4th Gen results are more than reliable and chances are that I'm in the clear since the 20 day is just 1 day before the 3 week mark. (P24 peaks at 3 weeks) and these tests would of easily caught it.

He took his time to talk to me and told me tests are more than conclusive at 28 days(4 weeks). However due to procedure doctors reccommend to test at 28 days, 3, 6months, and again reassured me my 18 and 20 day tests are more than reliable."

Long story short he turned out to be a huge narcissist and we are no longer in contact. When we broke up I confronted him again to make sure he was clear and if I needed to go get tested and he assured me he had been tested when he had gotten sick about 2 months before we broke up but that he had in fact never gotten tested before we became sexually active. As I said before, we are not in contact however, he is also a friend of a friend and as time goes on, I keep hearing more and more integrally  questionable things he is doing and cases where he is caught lying. He lied to me before about being tested, I don't know if he lied to me about any of his doctor visits.

&amp;#x200B;

If thats the case then why does sources say:

 

While occasionally this period will be a little longer, 99% of HIV-infected individuals would be detectable within 44 days of exposure.

""An **antigen/antibody test** performed by a laboratory on blood from a vein can usually detect HIV infection 18 to 45 days after an exposure "" this is from CDC 

**Antibody tests** can take 23 to 90 days to detect HIV infection after an exposure ""

[https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/hiv-testing/test-types.html](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/hiv-testing/test-types.html)

&amp;#x200B;

If p24 only helps some people then why is 4th gen so superior to 3rd gen hiv test to point that it shortens it for 99% of people???

&amp;#x200B;

 The window period for antibody tests is between 3 weeks and 3 months. Up to 95% of people will have antibodies after 6 weeks, and 99% of people will have antibodies after 3 months. 

 The 4th generation EIA test is the standard HIV laboratory screening test used in BC. Ninety-nine percent of these tests will be positive 6 weeks after a person gets HIV.

My topic is the correlation between the Reagan administration’s handling of the AIDS crisis in the 1980s to current day social stigma around HIV/AIDS. In order to analyze this, I’m conducting narrative research (interviews) with two separated groups: (1) people who were diagnosed and lived with HIV/AIDS during the Reagan administration (1981-1989) and (2) people who were diagnosed and lived with significantly after the Reagan administration (2000 to present). I expect interviews to take anywhere between 20 minutes and an hour, depending on the level of detail the interviewee is willing to go into, but I’m happy to spend more time (or less if necessary). Interviews would take place the week of March 1st, but I’m flexible with dates if needed. I’m happy to use Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or just a phone call.

It would be a huge help if anyone here would be willing to sign up to be interviewed! If you're interested, you can email me at [noramohamed@gmail.com](mailto:noramohamed@gmail.com), PM me here, or just comment and I’ll contact you.

Post-exposure prophylaxis, or PEP, is a method of preventing HIV infection. It involves using a four-week course of the drugs used to treat HIV, taken very soon after a person may have been exposed to the virus.

It is an emergency measure, rather than one to be used as a regular method of preventing HIV transmission.

The paper, published online March 3 in the *Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved*, highlights the potential of integrating PrEP programs into public clinics that reach more patients with high HIV transmission risk but who often lack access to reliable health care.  

For the study, the research team surveyed 1,464 HIV-uninfected patients who visited two public Baltimore City Health Department clinics devoted to sexually transmitted diseases in 2016. Of the participants, only 18 percent, or 258 participants, reported prior knowledge of PrEP. Four percent (10 participants) were already using PrEP. Importantly, 46 percent of the 1,397 patients unfamiliar with PrEP, or 638 participants, indicated they were highly receptive to learning more about PrEP, with interest among the high-risk men having sex with men (MSM) patients even higher at 63 percent.

Since being diagnosed with HIV not too long ago, I’ve been doing a lot of reading on life expectancy. I keep reading information that seems to conflict itself, or at the very least I’m unable to find data that backs up what others are talking about.

I’m curious if anyone has any reading suggestions for updated life expectancies for people living with HIV+. More and more I’m hearing (verbally) that people diagnosed and moved onto ARVs quickly will live a healthy, normal life, but a lot of the articles I read seem to illustrate that while life expectancies are close to “normal,” quality of life may not be the same.

The only reason I can think of for all of the different opinions out there is the fact that drugs/therapies have changed so quickly over time. For example, I’ve heard that earlier ARVs were harsher on patients, compared to say a single-dose three-in-one drug I have been placed on about 8 weeks after diagnosis (Biktarvy for me).

The other factor I’ve considered is maybe life expectancy is simply not studied enough yet due to the fact that effective therapies were not available until the early/mid 90’s. So basically we’re really just now starting to document aging with HIV.

Any thoughts on this? Do you think there is any truth to my assumptions?"

I'm trying to get some perspective and see what my options are about this. I'm interested in travelling abroad, throuh Europe, for an extended period of time - perhaps 6 months or so. That said, I have to complete my lab work every three months and have to get my prescription monthly. Are any POS travelers out there that have been able to circumvent this issue? 

I would assume I could get my labs done in Europe, but since I would be uninsured there would the labs be expensive? Any info on your experiences with this would be appreciated. 


Thank you"

mql9p9,Getting Abroad with HIV,https://www.reddit.com/r/hivaids/comments/mql9p9/getting_abroad_with_hiv/,Feyran,1,2021-04-14 00:05:07,23,/r/hivaids/comments/mql9p9/getting_abroad_with_hiv/,NaN,"Hi there,
I'm having some problems here and hope the hive intelligence of reddit could help me out.

I'm a 23yo Gay guy who was diagnosed with HIV a year ago. I'm currently studying English and Social studies to become a teacher here in germany. In order to finish my studies I need to get abroad to an English speaking country for at least 3 months though I really  really want to do more than that so I can really get to know how it feels like to live in a different country. I actually planned to do that in a Year or two from now around 2022 and 2023 so hopefully covid is no longer too much of a problem at that time.

Before the diagnosis I was confident to find a host Family in the US or Canada to take a happy open minded male au pair. Unfortunately HIV made it way more complicated than that. Getting abroad with HIV means to take care about medication for a long period of time and lab test for screening. 
Fortunately in Germany my HIV infection is completely covered by Health insurance, Its also usual to get the medication for three months in advance. However my insurance won't cover anything HIV related in another country so as soon as I'm trying to get a lab or run out of medication I brought with me, I'd need to pay for it by myself. 
However, I could get around this problem by either convincing my insurance company to give me the medication for 6 months in advance or by having my boyfriend send me new medication every 3 months.
Doing my lab is another problem but I think that as long as there no severe changes until I'm about to leave it should be okay if Id do that just every 6 months for the time I'm Abroad. 

So If anything works out fine it should be possible for me to get Abroad for at least 6 months. It may even be possible to get Abroad for a year I'd just need to get back to Germany after 6 months for a few days to pick up new medication and get my lab done then heading back to wherever I'll be doing my time abroad.

Well now there's that big problem that's keeping me thinking for quite some time. Being a (gay) male already cuts the amount of host families in half. As a male with HIV my chances are close to zero. In another subreddit a mother stated that even though she knows about U=U, she wouldn't take the 0,000001% chance of me transmitting HIV to her kids if she could just pick another Aupair without any health conditions. Which even if it sounds ridiculous (I mean chances are low there will be any Situation where I could accidentally pass on HIV to her kids even IF I'm not undetectable) it still makes sense for me. 

My only options therefore are to find gay couples, people who are HIV positive themselves or just people who want to support a guy in my Situation. Unfortunately I really don't know where to look. I'm willing to do anything from child care to house-keeping, personal assistance or tutoring. I guess I just can't do any hard physical work or cook (I can do some easy dishes but beside that my cooking sucks 😂). I'm also happy to learn new things and do things I haven't done before. I just don't know where to look for those people. I already reached out to a few Agencies who told me that It's not easy to find someone if there are so many other Aupairs who don't have that kind of problems. And I'm probably better of looking for myself.

Life hasn't been easy on me but fortunately I'm a happy and optimistic person and always try to overcome all those obstacles that life throws in my way and I guess this one will take some time to sort out, but I just don't want my infection to get in my way. So if anyone who has read this far has any tips, advice knows where I could ask for more support, has been in a similar situation knows someone or even knows someone who knows someone that could help me out that would be awesome."

This might be me overthinking this, but I don’t see anything here that says “result” only the “range/unit”. I have had lab tests before that clearly say “Result: Negative” which is why I’m kinda thrown off. I know it says non-reactive but idk if that means the reference range or if this is my final result. I think this is clearly me being non-reactive, but I just wanna be sure I’m not reading this wrong!

I had unprotected sex after a long relationship. Met the dude on tinder and I’m a female.  I haven’t really spoken to him since. I did ask him if he was clean and he said yes. He didn’t cum in me, he came in his hand and I felt the Pre cum when I gave him head. But I still freaked out and I went and got tested 3 days later (I know it was early) Everything came back negative, I waited longer for my herpes result. To which that came back ultimately negative after the inhibition assay. So my index was 2.67, it deemed me positive but after the assay, it was negative. I got my result for that 2 weeks later and they recommended I took the test again to be sure. Which I did, and a week later I got my results which came out the exact same way, positive with my index lower than before, then negative after inhibition assay. Now I’m going on over a month later and I keep getting like random “bug bites” or “ringworm” looking things, on random parts of my body. They went away when I didn’t scratch and they didn’t get bigger. Well I developed one in inner thigh closer to my groin. It just looks like a ringworm to me but I can’t be too sure. I also have lymph nodes swollen but it’s weird it’s only on the left side of my body. My left armpit, the left side of my neck, my left tonsil felt weird. I don’t have much of a cough and I also don’t feel sick. I’m putting stuff for ringworms on that thing on my groin area, it’s still itchy and I feel like it might be getting bigger? I can’t tell. I will keep updated but I don’t have any other symptoms other than that. Can someone give me some peace on this? I hardly get sick so I can’t see why I would be fighting off an infection. My UTI is gone, my bowel movements are pretty normal, I have an appetite, I’ve slept with one person recently (someone I trust) I’ve been taking daily vitamins, I drink warm water with lemon and apple cider vinegar every morning. I’m scared. I know it’s possible to take a while for symptoms to show. I also am aware it’s not the end of the world and I am going back to get tested next month for HSV 2. HSV 1 came back negative both times."

Three and a half weeks ago, I (26M) decided to explore my sexuality and hooked up with an older man I met on Grindr. This was only my second sexual encounter with a man. We met at a nice hotel, and he said he was in town for business. After a couple glasses of wine and we engaged in anal sex using a condom (I bottommed).
  
Even though he assured me he was married, had no known STD's, and used a condom, the next morning I panicked and decided to go to the local health center to get put on PEP (Biktarvy) for 30 days. I took my first pill approximately 18 hours after the encounter (3:30pm Wednesday versus 11:30pm the previous Tuesday night), and have taken one every morning since. My initial bloodwork from that day came back negative, and I now have 6 pills to go. I still cannot shake the feeling that I am infected.  
  
He insists he is clean and is married, but speaking several weeks afterward on the app, he admitted he is not sure the last time he was tested. He said he used a condom the entire time, but before sex, he was grinding up on me from behind without one on, and he ejaculated on my chest afterward.  I worry that after wiping myself down with a towel, there is a chance that some of his ejaculate could have gotten into my ass, which I inspected that night with a towel. There is also always the chance he took off the condom during sex.  
  
I know I went on the pill within 18 hours which is good, but I can't stop worrying that mine are ineffective, or I took them too late, or something else went wrong.  
  
In recent days I have developed a dry and scratchy throat, and my body randomly aches. I am worried these are symptoms of an acute HIV infection.  
  
My second blood tests are on Monday (3 days from now), and I cannot stop worrying about them. I've spoken with my therapist, with my close friends, and have even posted on reddit elsewhere, and I can't stop worrying. I feel like I'm spiraling.  
  
My anxiety is out of control and I am ashamed I cannot look at this situation rationally. I am just worried that I ruined my life. Is there anything I should have done differently? Is there anything I can do to stop these frantic, out of control thoughts?"

I read a few times that the sooner the hiv infection is diagnosed (and the treatment begins), the better it is for the patient. So here is my question : if a patient has been noticing swollen lymph nodes after one or two weeks after the potential hiv infection and for at least 48 hours, will 4th generation tests be able to detect hiv antigens / antibodies or is it necessary to wait for one or two more weeks before he takes a test?

I'd say that if lymph nodes are swollen because of the infection, from that time on, there is a high probability that antigens and/or antibodies are already produced in a sufficient quantity to be detectable, but maybe I'm wrong.  Of course, I know that swollen lymph nodes could be caused by a simple cold, and that an other test would be advised at least 6 weeks after the potential infection."

That vessicles appeared like 8 months after I had several sessions of sex (just oral sex) with a stranger I met in Grindr.

He was the reason I got tested, I wanted to be sure where my sexual health stood before things got too serious. I was devastated when I came back positive. I was finally meeting someone who I could really see myself having a relationship with, and now I’m HIV+. We dated for a few more weeks before I called it off. I simply could not bring myself to tell him, besides the fact that he was moving much faster than I was. We had known each other for just over 2 months and he told me he loved me.

I am in a serious pickle. I suspect I have HIV and I believe that the symptoms are progressing into the later stages (AIDS). This all started years ago when I first lost my virginity at 18½ to a guy I used to go to highschool with. I am a formely sheltered kid, so I had very little knowledge of STDs or the dangers of not using protection at the time. I was young and had low self esteem, happy that this guy found me attractive and that I could potentially have my first real boyfriend. I was also going through a hard time too since my mother abd grandmother passed away and had nobody to turn to, soi was extremely emotional. Despite my gut telling me not to go with him to his home,I still did it. I tried to force him off of me and resist, but he was insistant. Later on into the week, my lymph nodes on the left side of my neck were swollen and my aunt took me to a clinic to get tested after I freaked out and told her what happened. I got my results back and I was positive for chlamydia. I received treatment for it and that was that, but my lymph nodes were still swollen. I knew something was seriously wrong because weeks turned into months and they still didn't go away. My periods were no longer regular and instead of 5 days they lasted only 3. I had shortness breath, and my lymph nodes would sometimes even be painful when they were swollen. I have a swollen lymph node on my groin that never went away as well. I went to my OB/GYN every 2-6 months get tested and still everything came up negative. This all happened towards the middle-end of 2018. Then at the endof 2019, I was having more symptoms. I got fevers, chills,night sweats, muscle fatigue, and I was just really unwell. I had a reoccurring canker sore that would appear on the middle of my tongue in the same spot everytime and I would use mouthwash or brush my teeth to get rid of it but it wouldn't go away until several days later on its own, but it would always come back. I've also had persistent,non stop pain in my eyes everytime I moved them. It was like a dull pressure and it never went away, even when I put on my glasses. My eyes became sensitive to light and I would be dizzy everyday. Strange,itchy red rashes on the Tsection of my face would come and go and they would appear on my arms or legs. These various symptoms would come and go and since the doctors couldn't figure out whats wrong I did my own research and found that these ARE in fact symptoms of HIV. I had to learn to live with all this because there was nothing I could do. I kept getting tested and everytime it came back negative. Now here I am 2021 and I'm 22 years old now and as of right now,I'm lying down in bed with difficulty breathing, my sense of taste and smells shot, I've been coughing and sneezing for the past few days. My boyfriend thinks its a cold or flu abd I've told him thats impossible because I haven't stepped outside of the house or come in contact with anyone besides him and he's not sick. I'm having a hard time breathing and my appetite is slowly fading and I'm so weak I barely move. I'm terrified that it might finally be progressing to the AIDs stage abd I'm helpless to do anything!! What do I do? Is there anything I can do? Please someone help!"

A former owner of a salon in New Mexico has been indicted on 24 felonies, including fraud and practicing medicine without a license, according to [reports](https://people.com/crime/salon-owner-indicted/), after authorities discovered at least two patrons contracted HIV after getting a “[vampire facial](https://www.foxnews.com/us/las-vegas-woman-allegedly-held-vampire-facial-parties-while-posing-as-nurse).”

Maria de Lourdes Ramos de Ruiz, 59, former owner of VIP Beauty Salon and Spa in Albuquerque, is also [charged](https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime) with racketeering, money laundering and tax evasion.

“Individuals who jeopardize the health and safety of New Mexican families must be held accountable,” Attorney General Hector Balderas [said](https://www.nmag.gov/uploads/PressRelease/48737699ae174b30ac51a7eb286e661f/Attorney_General_Balderas_Announces_Indictment_of_Former_VIP_Salon_Owner.pdf) in a statement. “We look forward to presenting this case at trial.”

A “vampire facial” is a [cosmetic](https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/beauty-and-skin/cosmetics) procedure that involves Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) therapy: drawing a patient’s blood, spinning it in a centrifuge and then injecting small amounts under the skin using multiple, small needles; blood also is applied topically on the skin.

In September 2018, the New Mexico Department of Health, the New Mexico Regulation and Licensing Department and deputy director of Boards and Commissions inspected the business, discovering unwrapped needles scattered around the salon, unlabeled blood tubes in a kitchen area and fake credentials for Botox and “vampire facial” training hanging on the walls."

I only learned about HIV and AIDS when I was taken to the hospital by ambulance and told I was in the AIDS stage - a million copies of viruses and a low CD4 count - and I was also diagnosed with Pneumocystis Pneumonia (PCP). I've been in the hospital for nearly four months for treatment. I told him I am still taking my daily dose and that my viral load had remained undetectable for many years. He stated that he wouldn't mind at all.

When I left his apartment the next day, he acted weird. My gut feeling told me that was our last kiss, the last time I touched his face. Then he ghosted me since then, never responding to my text.

This is the second time I've been ghosted after informing my date of my status. I didn't commit any crime, and I certainly don't deserve to be treated this way. Many have stated that HIV is not a death sentence, but it appears to have taken away the freedom to be in love or to be love."

MY HIV ANXIETY AND SYMPTOMS

Hey there Redditors  . Can i share to you about hiv-related thing ?  . 

So on February 17 i got an unprotected anal intercourse and after that hiv crossed my mind . After that i’ve been dealing with anxiety and stress about hiv , so maybe around 3 1/2 weeks later (8 march ) i went to a private hospital and talk about my case with a specialist and he told me that lets get you tested , the test was anti hiv rapid which taken from my vein and sent to a lab to get the results and it went back negative . And my doc said that i should came back a month after which is april 17 for future confirmatory testing with more sensitive test . So i went crazy while waiting for a month , i begin dealing with anxiety , and feel like im sick all the time , and my heart just racing cant go to sleep nightmares all day . So the second test finally came , i got back to the hospital get tested , the test is little bit pricey around $120 basically the test was 3 method test . The test was CMIA , ECLIA , and i can’t remember the third test it came back all negative , the test results was sent to my doctors office and he said its alright youre good , the virus is not there , its been 2 month and the most sensitive test can’t detect it . So i kinda relieved but not fully , u know what i mean , theres still worries with that , So i keep dealing with anxiety until today , and finally last week i got sick , i got a fever , and my joints are aching but it only lasted for 1 day . I woke up the next i was completely fine . But now im dealing with sore throat , finally I went back to my doc he said that ur just too stressed so u get sick easily , i dont know how to cope with these . Maybe if you previously have someone similarly talked about this to you maybe do u have any tips on this . 

Really i want my life back 
Timeline : 
17th february (possible exposure) 
8 march (1st test - rapid )
17 april (cmia , eclia , ) 
All negative .

Is there any chance that my hiv test change in the third month ? Or im just having really bad anxiety?"

Had sex a while back before a met my boyfriend who was a former heroin user. 

Only had sex with him twice, no protect I was on the implant  when I had sexual intercourse with him. He told me he didn’t have any STD’s or anything so I left it at that. 

Recently had my first HPV smear screening as I’ve turned 25. That’s threw me off a little and right now I’ve been very worried about my sexual health. Had three sexual partners, third is my current boyfriend. 

No symptoms like rashes or anything. No warts near the genital area that I know off. But, after spending some time away with my boyfriend we engaged in oral sex. My mouth has been slightly achy and I’ve seen two red bumps with a white spot either side of my throat. Now I wear a retainer in bed for my teeth and I don’t engage in oral sex that much. 

Decided to get a HIV/ STD blood test online. Just taken it earlier today but I didn’t managed to get much blood out of my finger from the lancet and probably under the 400 mark which I’m unsure if they will pick up a result from it. I pushed hard to get blood droplets from my finger which has slightly bruised it. 
Would like to know what the likelihood of having an accurate result would be from this. 

Also what is the likelihood that I have HIV from what I have mentioned? I don’t tend to get cold sores, canker sores or any spots “down there” and I feel fine. Is it just the HPV screening that has thrown me? My boyfriend doesn’t have any cold sores, his private part looks clean? What are the chances I have HIV?"

It is important to set aside time for physically moving your body to ensure natural processes that involve the muscles and tissues are functioning properly. While we all need exercise, HIV **positive** people have a more reason to engage in physical activity. Although medication and antiretroviral drugs

may be enough to boost your immunity or help fight the virus in your body, exercise is crucial. Do not underestimate the body's ability to naturally fight virus and any strange cells to full recovery. Exercise slows progression of HIV and also increases blood count, which is integral for transporting white blood cells to necessary parts of your body. In fact, according to a health research campaign in South Carolina, HIV infected people that exercise for at least four times in a day are less likely to develop AIDS.

## Starting off is half of succeed

Starting off an exercise program is not easy. Many people have negative energy whenever a topic of exercise comes up with regards to healthy living. The increasing campaigns and gym centers evidence the importance and need of people in society to engage their bodies in physical exercises. The modern lifestyle deprives the body of its ability to function naturally because of automation of every aspect. We sit and only move to pick a cup or get into a car. It is not easy to start exercising because your body is used to a dormant kind of lifestyle. But you have no option, you need to exercise. You can actually make it simpler for your body.

You do not have to set high goals 'unrealistic' at the beginning. The only thing you will achieve when you begin on a high note is disappointment. Set realistic goals. When starting out in exercise you have to first consider the level you are in HIV treatment. Secondly, analyze your level of body fitness, which determines the kind of exercise you need. Beginning with a highly strenuous activity will not work you will not last more than a week. Choosing the kind of exercise is crucial; begin on a fun finding mission. You can run for short distances consistently for two weeks before advancing the exercise.

**Why does exercise help?**

Basically, exercise keeps your body tissues and organs active and functional. Although exercise is recommended to everyone, it is more beneficial if you are HIV positive. In fact, if you begin exercise early, you are less likely to advance to AIDS. Yes, exercise can help in managing and halt progression of HIV.

When you run, for instance, your lungs open up thus increased oxygen intake. Also, the heart rate increases thus pumping blood to all parts of the body that activates the tissues and body organs. When you are infected with HIV, all you need is active cells to fight the virus. Active and clean blood around the body helps in boosting the **immune** system of your body. Besides common need for physical fitness, exercise helps in reducing anxiety and depression, which HIV patients are likely to experience.

## Between exercise, how to relax

While it is highly advisable for you to exercise, it is important to when to go out and engage your body in physical movement and when to stay indoors. It all depends with the level of **treatment**. Some antiretroviral drugs are strong with side effects that would not allow you to go out alone and engage in energy activities. If you feel dizzy, nauseous, or just had a diarrhea, avoid engaging your body in energy depletion activities. You might insist on exercising and actually worsen your condition.

Every day is different for an HIV patient. While you may have been active yesterday and did run for 30 minutes, the next day you might be feeling weak. If you are in the middle of a physical activity and you feel extremely exhausted, do not insist on going on exercising. You might fall and not only hurt yourself but worsen your condition. Be sure to self-evaluate your body every other time before you go out. While it is essential, be wise to know when to stop."

28th April (28 full days post-encounter): Negative

&amp;#x200B;

I am aware that the tests on the 5th and 16th of April were rather useless, but I did them anyway.

Please note that I still get tested routinely every 3 months, but my next test is on the 3rd of August, which is quite a bit far away.

I have been worried and anxious about HIV, do I need to be? Do I require any further testing to absolve myself from this specific encounter?

Around 24 days ago, I had sex with an escort. I had shaved my genitals an hour prior to sex and I heard that it can increase the chances of contracting certain STDs. She did however make me wear a condom. 

2-3 days later, I noticed some ulcers near the tip of my penis, an area was covered by the condom. The ulcers don’t really hurt but they can sting at times. This was accompanied by a sore throat and mild fever which was gone at day 5. 

Around 14 days after sex, I noticed a sore throat again and what felt like a very mild temperature also came along (could have just been stress related). At day 24, my throat still feels weird and I’m just a little worried because I read about the acute HIV seroconversion symptoms that can occur around 2-6 weeks after a possible exposure. Although the chances of me contracting HIV are incredibly low given that the escort makes her clients wear condoms and that HIV transmission is so difficult, I’m still somewhat worried. 

I had called a sexual health clinic but they said that I didn’t need PEP due to the low chance of me contracting HIV but now that I have these symptoms, I’m getting nervous and I’m too scared to take a HIV test. 

I’d appreciate some input from someone who may have been in this position before or someone who may know more than me."

Hello,
I first wanna say that this community is amazing and I appreciate the members here. My question is about the hiv 1 and hiv 2 test also known as the duo/combo test. I took my test at the 40 day mark. Then ocd got the best of me. I’m a little confused about the possibility of  being two different duo test one 3rd generation one 4th generation. Other sources say the duo test is always fourth generation? I guess I’m trying to figure out if I took the 4th generation test for sure. I got blood taken from the vein of that helps."

In the past 2 years, I’ve tested upwards of 20 times, my last test being negative in January. I’m a woman who has hetero sex, uses condoms, and tests regardless. I shared a bank note to snort coke with my gay friend in March and have felt run down ever since. Headaches, chills, fever, night sweats, swollen lymph nodes, herpes outbreaks. I’ve been pretty adamant I’ve got leukaemia or lymphoma, but my doctors are very skeptical and approach all of my concerns through a mental health lens. 

With the negative test in January at the back of my mind, I was able to talk myself down from my usual HIV panic, until I had sex last week and the guy removed the condom without my consent or knowledge, triggering STI-based anxiety all over again. The symptoms I’ve been experiencing for the last couple of months would not be a result of this encounter, so if I am positive, it will be from sharing snorting equipment with my friend, who has unprotected sex with many partners, who he blocks afterwards. I asked him yesterday when he last tested and he angrily espoused avoidant, ignorant ideas about not needing to test because nobody he knows is sick. But he wouldn’t know if they were, because he blocks people straight after sleeping with them. 

I know it’s not a discussed route of transmission, and I know I need help with my pre-existing hypochondria and fixation on HIV (which I am receiving), but it is theoretically possible to contract the virus through the delicate membranes in the nose, if there were microscopic amounts of positive blood on the bank note. I know i’m probably going to get torn a new one for being ignorant, prejudiced and uneducated, but I’ve felt so unwell since the snorting session, I’m waiting on results and I’m not the most rational of people in the first place.  

This post isn’t going to be well received and I’m sorry in advance, but please can somebody talk to me about the phenomenon of HIV anxiety, what it’s like to live with HIV, how you’ve processed your status, your experience as a positive person in the wider world, and how to best start meaningful discussions that foster positive attitudes toward HIV? I’ve spent so much time and energy reading about HIV, thinking about it as a formative epoch in the history of humanity, that I’d like to learn to be an ally and advocate, whether i’m positive or not."

-Canker sores
-Some nights of night sweats (torso &amp; t-shirt drenched)
-Body rash/follicitus-acne on my torso and upper arms
-joint pain in hips and knees 
-fatigue/malaise

The last contact I had with this person was fingering (low risk but still using as last contact) so if that’s the last thing then

I got a fourth gen at 65 days along with qualitative RNA both were negative 

At 108 days I went to planned parenthood and got a finger prick test it was an Alere combo test. It was also negative

Seems like this test is fairly accurate but maybe I shoulda done a fourth gen at the 90 day mark along with a qualitative RNA?

Someone one Reddit who works at planned parenthood said that test is 99

I can get these tests cheaper online than through my Dr. Is there any tests I can request my Dr to do?

When I asked him about HIV testing he told me to test again in 6 months. However when I spoke to his PA she stated I don’t have HIV (this was before I got the night sweats and follicitus)

I thought three months was supposed to be conclusive but I also know when you donate blood after finger prick they also test the blood using (I believe 4th gen) and other tests?

I am not a hypochondriac but my symptoms have scared me beyond words. I know it’s a treatable illness but I’m worried I could be infectious and not on treatment.

What should I do to conclusively determine my status. Are there other tests I should take or windows I should be aware of?

I’m not sure if there are medical professionals on here or someone knowledgeable on how to conclusively determine status.

13 days ago I had unprotected vaginal sex (male) 

About two days ago I had gotten a sore throat and a slight pain in my inner ear, that quickly subsided, and last night I had extreme chills and a low-grade fever. Today my fever has subsided but my throat is hurting again. I've felt weak and fatigued the entire time and had a lack of appetite. I also had one instance of diarrhea. 

Symptoms aside, I've done extensive HIV reading so I decided to get tested for the flu, covid, and strep. All tested negative. The doctor also tested my CD4 cell count and it's normal. However, she diagnosed me with a low grade fever of unknown origin. This concerns me because I've never had an illness like this before (especially that couldn't be diagnosed). My symptoms seem mild and I only had the severe ones (fever and chills) for about 12-18 hours.

Does anyone (who has HIV) have any personal experiences with their HIV symptoms? Or could anyone chime in on what it could be? I apologize, I'm definitely a hypochondriac and I'm paranoid at this point. Thank you."

I  have a substance dependency/abuse problem with prescription medication -  and when I take it, I make bad impulsive decisions that I wouldn't even  consider when I'm my normal/sober self.

Last  week, in one of these episodes, I visited an Asian escort/sex worker  and engaged in intercourse.  However, the condom that she provided did  not come from a wrapper.  Instead, it was unpackaged (though I think  possibly still scrunched/rolled up) and she took it out of a jar  by the  nightstand (like a supplement bottle or something).  The intercourse  was not aggressive or abrasive, and was over within 5 minutes or so.

What concerns me the most is this -

* 3 days later, I noticed a slight sore throat coming.
* 4th  day: On the morning of the 4th day, I woke up with a real sore throat,  but also body aches, and a radiating, throbbing headache.  My shoulders  and neck muscles were tinging with pain as I tried to move around and I  felt generally weak.
* 5th  day:  I was experiencing much more fatigue, and developed a low-grade  fever (99.5-100.3 F), and was feeling cold all day and night.  The  biggest symptoms I was feeling were both a progressively worsening sore  throat and the persistent headaches....I was taking Advil every couple  of hours.  I couldn't swallow, and my whole neck area hurt, as well as  my jaw/ear area (felt like they were under pressure), just soreness all  around my neck and jaw area to the touch).  By night, my nose was  completely blocked and I couldn't breathe at all through my nose.  I  used Flonase, and was expectorating brownish mucus (which I have had  experienced mildly from time to time due to vaping JUUL) - but this  time, the mucus included faint, small specks and tinges of RED (e.g.  blood).  Personally I feel like the JUUL is responsible for much of my  airway injury.
* 6th  day: Fever was gone by the 6th day (so essentially it only lasted a  single day).  Woke up in the morning to soaked sheets (night sweats).  I  can't recall the last time I've experienced those.  Now I'm at the  7-day mark since the occurrence.  The fever and fatigue has been gone,  but I still have a worse-than-average sore throat,  slight facial/throat  pain, and lingering headaches.

I  am absolutely petrified as browsing on Google for 'initial HIV  infection symptoms' led me to a checklist of a list of symptoms - all of  which I had, across the board.  I am basically looking for some info  from those in the medical industry who are more familiar with what the  timeline typically looks like to develop symptoms from HIV  exposure/infection (is is possible to, in 3-5 days after?), and what the  odds are of getting infected in a one-time encounter (if a person was  HIV positive, and if the condom was broken or had microscopic tears)?

Really appreciate any help/info/assurance anyone could provide.  Thank you so much kindly in advance."

Being someone with anxiety, my anxiety peaked and I contacted the hotline twice. Both of the operators told me the test was invalid and I shouldn't worry - but here I am still worrying.

I plan on doing a rapid test and blood test again soon ASAP, but how do I get over this fear? Even though my boyfriend is presumably negative and the last guy I fucked besides him was on PreP and I wore protection, I still have this constant plaguing anxiety that I still have HIV somehow. I unfortunately don't have the most supportive environment and if I do test positive it would have a massive blowback to my relationship and to my family.

I wanna believe I'll be fine as I use protection with everyone and I've only fucked one other guy since i got my last full panel STD test in March (that guy was on PreP and I wore a condom correctly) while my boyfriend has not fucked anyone since he last got tested (full blood panel, and as we live together 24/7 I can generally trust him), but I still have constant anxiety and fear of what might happen

Enochian BioSciences announces Scientific Presentation of a Person with HIV Exhibiting Controlled Blood Levels of Virus for 255 Days Following Treatment with a Novel Cellular Therapy

May 12, 2021 08:00 ET| Source: Enochian Biosciences, Inc.

LOS ANGELES, May 12, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (NASDAQ: ENOB) – Enochian BioSciences, Inc., a company focused on gene-modified cellular and immune therapies in infectious diseases and cancer, today announced the release of preliminary data relating to the use of a novel cell therapy approach in controlling human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in humans. Dr. Serhat Gumrukçu, co-founder and inventor of Enochian BioSciences and Director of the Seraph Research Institute (SRI), presented the findings at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGCT). Presentation can be found at https://www.enochianbio.com/about-us/collaborations/
A 54-year-old man, diagnosed with HIV in 1986, had persistent HIV detected in his blood, despite antiretroviral therapy. With approval from an Institutional Review Board, this single patient was treated with a novel cellular therapy of natural killer (NK) and gamma delta T-cells (GDT) – a small subset of immune cells that can be infected with HIV but could also be a key factor in controlling the virus. The NK and GDT cells were collected from a person who does not have HIV. Because the patient stopped antiviral treatment and received some supportive medication before the cellular therapy, the level of HIV initially increased, as expected.
However, HIV levels began to decline after approximately three weeks, and after 100 days dropped below the detection level of routinely used blood tests (20 copies/ml). HIV levels in the patient’s blood have remained at or below detection for an additional 255 days, all while the patient has not been taking antiviral medication.
This innovative cell therapy could be a potential strategy to achieve a “functional cure” for HIV. This could potentially allow persons living with HIV to stop antiviral treatment for extended periods of time. Dr. Gumrukçu and SRI are currently pursuing a regulatory pathway with the FDA to study the approach in more patients. Enochian BioSciences holds the exclusive license for the proprietary technology.
Dr. Mark Dybul, a prominent global HIV expert and Executive Vice Chair of Enochian BioSciences said, “As an HIV researcher, clinician and former leader of large, global HIV treatment programs, I am excited by these results. Although antiviral treatment is very effective, it is expensive and some patients cannot, or do not want to receive it. This, combined with the fact that access to antiviral treatments is limited, creates a significant unmet medical need. While the findings presented are preliminary and in one person with HIV, I’m hopeful that with further testing in larger patient populations, SRI’s novel cell therapy approach could one day be an alternative HIV treatment to many.”

Anyways, the reason I ask is because I had gotten tested last year and everything seemed fine. And I say seemed fine because they wouldn’t give my test results over the health app they have or over the phone because I had to come and get them in person (and I can’t because I have no way to get to that area at the moment) but I assumed that I didn’t test positive since I think they’d have to ask me to come in if that were the case. Since then I’ve only had unprotected sex with two guys, both of which I was in a relationship with. A few days after having sex with my second partner I had gotten a headache and a sore throat that had lasted 3 days before going away today and last night he had vomited and felt a bit under the weather today. He thinks it’s because of him not taking his anti depressants for a bit and then taking them again. I’m not convinced. I don’t think it’s covid since we’ve had both of our shots and it’s possible it could just be a cold or weather related illness but it’s scaring me. I want to schedule a doctor’s appointment to get tested ASAP but how long do I have to wait for it to show up through blood work?"

On May 26 I came back for another blood draw test (till waiting for my result June 9), they did another rapid test (negative).  On May 28, I found out the guy I had sex with is HIV+ undetectable and it put me in absolute nightmare and brief because when I asked he said he is clean.  With that I went to get another rapid test (May28) because I really don’t know what to do, I was in so much pain and depress (ChemBio HIV 1/2 Ab was negative).  
I don’t know what to do, the + guy lied about his status and now I’m really confused and scared.  I haven’t had sex for a while and the first time I decided is now putting me in fear."

He’s been positive for about five years now, he takes his medication and all of that. I don’t mention his status at all, I don’t really acknowledge it (if you know what I mean) because I understand that he is way more than his HIV status. I’ve dated guys who were positive before and they talked about it all the time and related their fatigue or sleepless nights, nightmares and IBS to the medication they were taking for treatment. I guess because things are really new between us and I don’t know how it effects him, I’m reaching out for advice to see just how I should navigate this with him while we are dating. I know patience and empathy (not pity or sympathy) is key in any sensitive situation. I don’t treat him likes he’s going to break I treat him and I embrace him and am as affectionate with him as I would any healthy person who I’m intimately interested in because I’m not ignorant to the disease and I understand how it works when it’s treated and when it’s untreated. Ultimately, I do not want him to be self conscious around me."

I'm a straight male but I have slept around with many prostitutes, the sex has always been protected, blowjobs sometimes not, I know its considered low risk, but all the what ifs, during the winter my hands are always bleeding from the cold, maybe a condom broke once. 
It all started back in March, weird marks started appearing on my penis, I instantly thought it was some kind of STD, I went to a dermatologist and he told me it was nothing and prescribed me some cream, to be fair it did not look like an STD, more like a skin condition. After that I have begun to become hyperaware about everything going on in my body, and well suddenly a couple of days ago I noticed two swelled hard lymph nodes, went to the emergency room for a blood test, I did not tell them I was afraid of HIV, because I'm embarassed, they did it and the blood results all turned out fine. Could HIV be picked up in a blood test even if they weren't testing for it? Anyways today I noticed another swollen hard lymph node on the back of my neck, all signs are pointing towards it being HIV, my fear is coming true, and I know you can still live a long life with HIV but still the thought of me being HIV positive at 21 years old scares me shitless. The only thing left for me to do is get a test, I'm really afraid tho, I am terrified of what the result might be, what my parents would say, or if I could even manage to hide something so big from my parents, I heard HIV medication is extremely expensive and I would of course need their financial support. What do you guys think, could this be HIV?"

There are now injections which can be taken monthly or bimonthly which are:
1) said to be more effective than pills
2) only necessary 6 or 12 times a year with a medical appointment to administer them 

So my question is?

If hiv-positive people who use such treatment can get their medical history certified by relevant health authorities of their treatment management will hiv still need to be declared to one’s partner as they’d be undectable and/= untraceable? Also if someone’s intentionally infecting people records may be able to to trace their diagnosis and not adhering to their medication (so that’s a thought)

To add, I’d like to make clear that I still think particularly in long-term relationships all parties should be aware of someone’s diagnosis as I know I would but in terms of casual this could be a real stepping stone for one’s social participation regarding dating)

I was listening to the news and they mentioned that exactly 40 years ago in this day the first few cases of HIV cases in Los Angeles were identified.  I think it's amazing to know how far medicine has advanced that we all can have a normal life span with a condition that once was a death sentence.  At the same time, hearing the news was triggering to see that 40 years later this virus is still around despite the fact that the transmission of this virtus can be completely preventable.

What are your thoughts and reactions? How the stigma can  be minimized or eliminated?  How testing for HIV can be promoted?  Why enough education about prep and pep is not around? Why some people refuse to get tested and prefer to stay in denial? Why some people who are diagnosed refuse to get treated? What can you do as an individual to educate others and to prevent any new diagnosis?"

Short of his not taking his meds at all, and I highly doubt that was the case here - I cannot speculate as to why people still die from HIV/AIDS these days.  **Alexis Arquette** died in 201, and I wondered the same thing in her case.

I do not mean at all to be insensitive, but I am genuinely curious why a guy in NYC in 2017 might have likely died from HIV-related causes. Or why Alexis might have died with her connections.

Are Viral loads very high when you get infected? 

Or at what time moment are the viral loads the highest if someone does not take medication  ? 

I’m asking because I did an HIV Viral load PCR after exposure and it showed &lt;40. ( I think it’s the minimum the machine could detect. 

This was at 7-8 weeks after possible sexual exposure.

I would assume if I would have HIV the viral load would definitely be higher at the 7-8 week mark right"

Sorry to late for the update, i have had broken heart problems with a boy, bad experience, bad feelings, lost weight, no sleep, obsession, etc... so it has been hard for me to back to normal. Now i am not fine but i am a little bit better and i can relate. 

So i am here now in Hospital to spend eight hours on observation. All vaccine shots has been done and now i am taking vesatolimod to boost the effect of vaccine. Vesatolimod is taken for 10 times. I have taken 7, just three more and it is finished. I am already very tired. Each time i take Vesatolimod i have to be long time in hospital. I have to stop eating 12 hours before, lot of analysis, etc... It was easier to think about that to actually do it ( as always).

So i am fine, this time i didn't feel nothing, not for vaccine, not for Vesatolimod. Maybe i am in placebo group, o maybe no. who knows. Right now i think that i prefer to be in placebo group, finish the vesatolimod, take away the ART and let the VL to rise fast so i can take again ART and finish the essay. 

Because if they take me the ART and i am in the vaccine group, and the vaccine works, even partially, i have to be monitorising more than 36 weeks, and it is too much time. All summer lost... Now it is like 6 month i began the study, and it's rough. 

The next update i will do will be when i took all vesatolimod dosis and take ART off. 

Let's see what happens then. 

pdta.- Sorry for my english. Today i am lazy so i didn't check the grammar or anything about.

Thanks for all people that write me and give me hope. I love it.

In the meantime (about 2 weeks later) I developed a slight diarrhea, slight headache, sore throat that doesn't hurt and some weird stomach sensations. These symptoms are still present today (1 week later), I've never had diarrhea that lasted more  than 2-3 days and I haven't had a sore throat in ages (Not even when I had the flu).  


I know the only way to know for sure is to get tested but like I said I'm waiting for the 1 month mark to pass to re do my tests and my anxiety is through the roof, I've prepared for the worst but I fear the medication my country currently has is quite old (From what I've gathered it's from around '96-2000 and it's about 7 pills per day."

Basically i slept with one woman (12 years older than me) from South America (i say this because i live in Europe and i ve never been with anyone outside my country).

I am worried i might have HIV only because i know she slept with maaaany guys.
My question is, is it possible to contract HIV but also not contract any other STD?
I am going to test on all STDs next week and i m curious if all the tests appear negative does that means there is a low chance of me getting HIV?"

I wasn't an active person even before my diagnosis (At work I drive a lot and at home I play video games/watch movies and go out from time to time), I don't smoke (quit a year ago), I rarely drink, I smoke weed from time to time, I try to stay away from junk food and drinks so it's safe to say that my lifestyle isn't that bad but it's also not ideal.

The sexual exposure was on 9 th April


I got symptoms (fever etc) and tested positive for covid 2 weeks later. 

After that I did 4th gen hiv test on 28th day which was negative

On 52 days I did a HIV PCR (viral load) test which the lab in the hospital said can be used for diagnosis as well. The result was &lt;40copies / ml and the minimum detection limít was 40 copies.  (lab says it means I’m negative)

On the 54th day I also did another 4 th gen test and it was also negative.

However since one week so around after 61 days after exposure. I’m having some rashes in my body. It goes away usually after few hours but comes again.

After all my testings, is it anyway that this could be related to HIV scare? Is there any need to test more?? I’m very anxious so I’m unable to think properly.

I hope you can help me think properly."

Three weeks ago, I went to a massage parlor and had protected intercourse with a lady there.   
Four days after the incident, I developed lymph nodes on my neck and sciatic nerve went crazy. I got extreme lower back pain that radiated down to my feet. I am not sure what is going on but as of right now, the lymph nodes are gone but my sciatic nerve is still hurting. 

Here are the test that I did so far 

**a week after incident:**

10 panel std check- negative 

Went to ER and they said there is no sign of infection in my urine and blood. 

**11 days after incident:**

HIV RNA TEST- negative

I am planning to retake take the 10 panel std check with the HIV RNA test next Monday but right now, I am deathly scared that I have an std, in particular HIV.

Based on what I did... what are the chances that I may have caught an std?"

The man told me that he doesnt have any std, having also 2 small children, but I know that he had other partners. I am really anxious about this and I dont know how or where to get tested. How high are the possibilitiea of getting hiv from oral sex? I want to mention that i have bloody gums after washing my teeths and brushed mu teeths after 15 minutes after the ejaculation.

He was hospitalized last month for a week because of pneumonia. A month later I asked him how he was doing and he said better but that his doctor is still monitoring him. He mentioned monitoring cell count but then quickly changed the subject. 

My question is, if you have HIV/AIDS, would you want a family member to ask you about it if you never told anyone?

I just want him to know I love him and I support him but I also want to respect his privacy if he doesn’t want to say anything."

Any different to before being hiv positive?
Any practices you now engage with when dealing with sexual partners?
Has it led you to being single for longer or not?
Increased rejection?
Do you struggle to enter into relationships or physical intimacy or are things as before?
Do you disclose your status (if it’s not illegal to do so)?
Has it impacted on the amount of sex you now have?
How do you navigate online dating such as tinder? Do you avoid doing so or if you use it do you provide possible casual partners of your status?

These are all theoretical questions based on aspects seen in experiences previously shared and they are just to help contextualise possible responses which may be shared. These are by no means  intended to reinforce existing notions which I hope are proved wrong but I do apologise in advance if anyone is unhappy with my phrasing.

Feel free to branch out and just provide personal experiences in the dating department as a HIV positive person"

Older age (&gt; 50 years) at HIV diagnosis was associated with persistent CD4:CD8 ratio inversion, whereas treatment of PHI was protective. \[...\] Here we show that treatment during primary HIV infection (PHI) was associated with recovery of the CD4:CD8 ratio to ≥ 1. Conversely, even after adjustment, older age at HIV diagnosis had a negative impact on CD4:CD8 ratio recovery, despite CD4 count gains, particularly in those aged &gt; 50 years. Change in CD8 count with ART was not significant in those aged 41–50 and &gt; 50 years (P = 0.146 and P = 0.135, respectively) (Table 5). CD8 count decrease with ART was therefore more likely at a younger age (≤ 40 years).\[...\] ART was beneficial for CD4:CD8 ratio normalization, but recovery to ≥ 1 occurred in only a third of patients (31.3%). Although CD4 count recovery was similar in younger and older age groups, CD8 count change did not occur in those diagnosed with HIV infection in the fifth decade or above. Those aged &gt; 50 years had lower baseline and post-ART CD4:CD8 ratios, and older age at diagnosis was associated with persistent CD4:CD8 ratio inversion even after adjustment and including those who started ART during PHI. These findings have implications for the long-term health of PLWH into old age and for older people diagnosed with HIV infection. \[...\] Evidence linking the CD4:CD8 ratio with undesirable immunological changes and poor clinical outcomes, including oxidative stress, cognitive disability and mortality, is associated with its inversion (CD4:CD8 ratio &lt; 1)."

I told her I know and if she wanted to talk about it we can but when I’m with her I’m 100% not thinking about her status, it’s nothing I “see” or think about when I look at her.

Am I being..too normal with her? Should I have said something different when she said that? I don’t want her feeling like I’m pretending that she doesn’t have HIV.

According to what i've read, both being in a densely populated city and being black increases someones risk for having HIV. We had unprotected sex about 4 times for a decently long period. I asked her if she had anything, she was able to provide proof of being negative for gonorrhea and chlamdyia on her phone through a portal.

It was weird though, when i asked her for HIV proof she either couldn't or wouldn't pull it up on her phone. Instead insisting they made her ""sign a release to get tested"" for HIV and that they told her it was negative. She then said she went into the doctors office but because it was only a ""nurse"" they couldn't ""give"" her results and that they told her it was for sure negative. Her last ex was an immigrant, black, and jamaican all of which are increased risk factors for him having HIV.

I know, i know, just get tested. And im going to. but i'm wondering if the sickness i JUST had sounds like HIV ARS( acute retroviral syndrome) basically a sickness most people with hiv get. And yes, i know not all do, and if you didn't get it then clearly you can't answer me.

I had a fever of 100-101.8 and i had body aches. I also had chills badly and noticeable stomach upset along with noticeable vomiting and couldn't keep anything even meds down. However the NEXT DAY i was fine and could eat normally (today). When i looked up how long the symptoms last it said typically (for hiv ARS) a ""few"" days to a couple weeks usually. What does a ""few"" days mean? A few means at least 3 or 4 doesn't it?   So mine doesn't match that description either. Could i have just had a 24 hour bug?"

[Immunize4Immunnity](https://www.immunize4immunity.org/) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in Virginia, United States. In the past, we have held projects to help India recover from its pandemic, and raised $25,000, spread information about the necessity of vaccines through our blog which has over 600,000 total readers, and held nationwide PPE fundraisers.

We are currently working on a project to spread awareness of HIV/AIDS to the general population. We believe that due to the sensitivity of the topic, there is a stigma that exists in society to where people try to avoid ever conversing about the subject. As HIV is getting more widespread throughout the world, we believe that this social norm is ultimately regressive. Our goal is to educate thousands of people across the world by putting a spotlight on the ever growing issue of HIV/AIDS.

We have begun our initiative by creating a general information packet, and are looking for bilingual people who would be able to translate the English document into a second language. If you are interested in creating a chapter for our organization or know any bilingual people who would be interested, please forward this message to them and contact us at [Immunize4Immunity@gmail.com](mailto:Immunize4Immunity@gmail.com)"

Jim Pickett, senior director of prevention advocacy and gay men's health for the AIDS Foundation of Chicago, said it's important for people to know testing can be done quickly, within a half-hour or less.

He pointed out for those who test negative, there's the option to take a prescription known as PReP, \[pre-exposure prophylaxis\], which is highly effective at preventing HIV. And for people who test positive, there are effective PEP \[post-exposure prophylaxis\] treatments that are easy to take.

Pickett added if you are HIV positive and treatment results in an undetectable viral load, you cannot transmit HIV to your sexual partners.

""If you find out your status, and you can get into care and treatment, you will stay healthy,"" Pickett explained. ""You can live a normal lifespan, which is something we couldn't say when I tested positive in the '90s.""

Pickett noted there were fewer HIV tests done and fewer doctors' visits for treating HIV during the pandemic. He hopes as more people get vaccinated against COVID-19 and learn about the option for self-tests at home, those numbers will climb.

Pickett emphasized many appointments can be done via telehealth, and expected technology to play a big role in HIV treatment going forward.

""I would suggest people who are sexually active, think about getting tested every three months or so,"" Pickett urged. ""It's just a good practice, and I would not only get tested for HIV, but I would get tested for other STIs as well.""

Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, echoed Pickett's recommendation, and this year especially are highlighting the option for self-tests at home.

Many local health departments and community organizations distribute free HIV self-tests, which can also be purchased at pharmacies or online.

oc3lp7,40th Anniversary of the First Article Published about HIV/AIDS,https://www.reddit.com/r/hivaids/comments/oc3lp7/40th_anniversary_of_the_first_article_published/,LifeInPhilly,1,2021-07-01 22:28:19,5,/r/hivaids/comments/oc3lp7/40th_anniversary_of_the_first_article_published/,NaN,"40 YEARS LATER

I was 4 years old when the first article about HIV/AIDS was published by the NY Times, ""[A Rare Cancer Seen In 41 Homosexuals](https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/03/us/rare-cancer-seen-in-41-homosexuals.html)."" It was July 3, 1981. I grew up knowing that AIDS was a horrible way to die, that it left people with sores all over their bodies, that they would waste away and become unable to care for themselves. I knew that gay men were disowned by their families and left to die alone. 

AIDS was also hysterical, a winning punchline to every joke. Kids are terrible. Good christians are worse, the worst people I have ever known. They preached that gays were getting what they deserved, a punishment from god for their wickedness. From Jerry Falwell to that asshole from Duck's Dynasty, it is still happening. We've come a long way but it is still a scary world for most of the world's gay and trans people.

I was 5 years old when I realized that I was gay. I was watching Friday Night Videos on our 13"" black and white television in my mother's bedroom. Suddenly, my mother screamed at me to turn the television off. I lunged at the television, she continued shrieking until I turned the knob to off. I thought the electric cord had caught fire. But, nothing. ""What happened?"" My mother explained that two men in the video were holding hands in the back of a car. I had seen that. She said that they were evil, perverts, ""gay birds."" I was confused. I said that I didn't understand because I hold hands with Sean (my best friend) and that was okay. She said that it was different for adults. These men were gay. The word abomination is something every little christian kid learns early. And, even though my mom thought it was different for boys and men to hold hands, I knew I'd be holding hands with men when I grew up. I still clearly remember being 5 and staring at the green glow that hovered on the screen after it had been turned off. 

Around that same time, a man who I didn't know called our house. I answered the phone and he asked to talk to my mother. I didn't know what gay looked like and I definitely did not know what it sounded like, but I felt an immediate connection to this man based on his voice. There was something familiar and beautiful about it. That gay voice, the voice that most of the gay men of my generation learned to hate about ourselves and about each other. My mother told him not to call again and slammed the phone down before telling me that he was a guy who she grew up with and he was gay.

My gay tribe spent most of our adolescence trying to change everything about ourselves. This goes way beyond our desire to hold hands with other men and our voices. It's the way we walk, the activities we do, the clothes we wear, the music we listen to. I used to watch Tony Danza and practice the way he smiled and laughed. We study masculinity and machismo then turn it into performance art. We put on their expressions and postures and we tell jokes about faggots and AIDS. This becomes our ideal, the epitome of what we want to be and, because we cannot pray the gay away, who we want to sleep with. Some of us adopt an identity that allows us to escape ridicule. Others are tortured. I'd argue that most of us spend some time considering suicide. We absorb everything we were taught by the people who hate us.

I was a great student. A gay guy lived on my street who carried a purse and had frosted hair. I was repulsed by him while I worshiped the white trash straight guys who I spent most of my time getting high with. By the time I was graduating high school, I convinced myself that I was growing out those gay feelings. I had girlfriends and I barely jerked off thinking about my best friends. That summer, I went to a music festival. It was grunge and punk and metal. And, just as I was starting to believe that I'd have a wife and kids and a suburban house with a tire swing, I saw Brian Grillo. He was ... well he was everything. He was the lead singer of Extra Fancy, a band that felt like a cross between the B52's and the Buzzcocks. He wore tight cut-off jean shorts with combat boots, very 90's. His head was shaved. He was muscular and covered in sweat as he banged on a giant steel tub. He looked like a skinhead but he was singing about being gay and having AIDS. I did not know there were gay men like this. I started coming out the next day.

The night I came out, I was homeless. When kids come out and end up on the streets, they have to do whatever they can to survive. It has long been known that LGBTQ kids make up a disproportionate amount of the homeless youth. While about 5-10% of young people are thought to be gay and/or trans, they make up 20-40% of the young homeless population. And the average age they become homeless is approximately 13-14 years old. They aren't old enough to get a legal job. These adolescents are homeless because they are hated and they are my heroes. I think they are about to change the world.

The generation of influencers and kids who were never told *no* are about to become adults. And, I feel good about it. They are qeerer and outer and more accepting than any other generation. I welcome a generation that cannot fathom that when I was their age it was illegal for me to have sex with my partners or marry my partner. I welcome a generation that will not take no for an answer to their demands for justice and equality. I welcome a generation that does it all while taking selfies. I argue that they embody the spirit of the gay and trans people of the early 80's, the people who dared to leave everything behind to live in big cities and dance until dawn. They were brave and defiant and fabulous. Their TicTocs would have been amazing.

As we recognize the 40th anniversary of that first article about a rare cancer seen in 41 homosexuals, it is impossible to calculate the loss. We lost brilliant minds, artists, musicians, designers, organizers, demonstrators, lovers and friends. When I think about those first 41 gay men, I wonder where they would be tonight. I like to think they would be gathered in groups of old friends, sitting on barstools, laughing about old times and watching the next generations of gay and trans kids dancing in front of mirrors. I like to think they would be proud of those of us who followed them, working to support organizations that really did make some amazing progress on things I never imagined I would see in my lifetime. I hope they would think we've done enough, that I've done enough.

I’ve just gone to get tested for STD’s and HIV and am so anxious that I will be HIV positive.

I'm feeling a lot of guilt, shame, ""my life wasn't supposed to be this"" bullshit but all in all I think I am okay, considering.  


My mom on the other hand is another story: she used to be pretty upbeat and happy, now she's sad all the time, she's crying a lot, not eating much.  


I hate seeing her like this but I don't know what I can do to make it better considering her view is the same as pretty much everyone in my country: HIV is something only sex workers, junkies, homeless people get and once you have it your life is pretty much over, at least socially.

She thinks I won't be able to find love, start a family, have kids. I explained u=u to her, how my life will be pretty much the same as anyone else's but she doesn't really understand it.   


What hurts the most is when I think about how hard she tried to raise me on her own and I end up getting HIV, I'm gonna have to get a grip and fix my mess of a life if I want to make her feel better I think.  


I don't know maybe it's too soon and I just gotta let time do it's thing, I'm just worried about her is all, I'm worried she might not be the same happy person again.

The specialist hiv nurse says I could have gotten from my mum as I was in aids stage, and my viral load was super low, (I don’t remember the number) however the weird things is I felt sick only once (flu like symptoms, fatigue and headaches).  I was so shocked I couldn’t stop crying, I thought i was in a nightmare. I have never educated my self around Sexual disease, and I pretty much thought about hiv as whore disease. I told myself I was one and all I wanted was to die instantly. I couldnt see the point of having to fight this virus eating my good cells and killing me slowly. I used to dream the same nurse telling me I’m not + and that it was all a misunderstanding. 

I don’t think I got it from my mum as I’m her first born and she had other 5 children. And all my siblings seems fine. I’m undetectable since 22 January 2020 and I have had sex with a guy but I didn’t  tell him my status because I felt shame and thought he would refuse me. It was protected sex but the condom broke and he continued and I didn’t stop him. 
If I’m undetectable am I all right not disclose ? I had sex once since I got diagnosed. I haven’t told anybody, my best friend knew something was up as all of the sudden I wanted to die so told her and she has been super supporting ever since. I  was on sertraline until last December I decided to stop them I felt the same the whole time. 
I started smoking weed to numb my feelings and not not think about it as it makes me cry. I haven’t told my mum and Idont think I will. 

I asked  for help, did a year of counselling and  joint the George house trust and met amazing people who had been diagnose more than me. They taught that I’m not my diagnosis, and that I can live a full healthy life without problems. 

But still when I think that I will forever feel ashamed for being positive, I cannot go Australia which was one of my dreams, I won’t be able to breastfeed, and I feel like if I had kids and without breastfeeding I receive a lot of judgement from my mum and the family. I still cannot think of hiv positively, I tear up everytime, even now. 
I try my best not to think about unless it’s 8pm when  the medication is due. 


When I think about it I feel I have lost my life even tho I’m my body is in good health and my mental is getting better because I refuse to think about it. 

Last week I had a weird dream about me being negative and the results were mistaken. Why my can’t I accept and live with like you all do ?

- March 20th had an affair with a lady in Western africa (did not penetrate but naked dry hump). 

- Felt sick 2 days after including uncontrolled diarhia and vomitting. 

-Uncontrolled Mycosis appeared on penis with cracks on the head (as I never had crack on the dick bfore) 

- 2 weeks later dry bumps started to appear on forehead (purple) and lips started to get crispy. unexplainable fatigue started to appear needed Nap more than often ro continue my day. Could Nap on my work chair

- Went back to Canada tested for errthing. Herpes Type 1 came back positive which explained the blisters and inconfort on lips.  

- Made another test after window period, still come back as negative. Sore Thrpat symptoms started to appear and muscles as well as joint pain appeared.  


- Later on feets symptoms appeared 
   - sensation of burning underfeet
   -Athlete foot wrinkles around nails 
   -Feel like feet be swollen 
   -White vertical line on nail starting from nail roots to tip of toes

- Still feeling sick after 'round 6 weeks couple bumps on foreheads still visible (might be heat bumps) 

- Still feel tired but nothing compare to the beginning of symptoms. 

- Noticed curved nails on toe and swollen lymph node still present. Actually feeling it in my jaw. 

- African Partner (Ladie) went for HIV testing  and came back negative.  She could still be in her window period. 

my question is: can seroconversion take more  than 3 months with symptoms lasting that long?  

Since Im in Africa it could be HIV type 2 which is hard to find antigen tests for it.

I recently got tested for HIV. Between then and my previous STI check, I’d only a handful of partners and the furthest I’d ever went was light foreplay or at a push oral. However the time came around for a screening. 

Anyway got to the clinic. Had a full screening done, answered questionnaire and had my bloods (extracted from vein in middle arm) and swabs done as well as urine. I asked the nurse would it be possible to do a HIV rapid test. She said of course!

I asked her did she need anymore blood from me (I was distressed) and she said no. She extracted a small amount of blood from the blue capped blood bottle, and dropped it on to the rapid test. It came back negative (as somewhat expected).

I am wondering if the fact the blood was in the blue capped blood vial, could it have messed the test up? Could I have gotten a false negative? What’s the chances of this? 

I am now awaiting the return of the lab results (which are the confirmatory results by science and law).

Could some health practitioners, nurses, doctors, lab scientist etc please offer in some knowledge. 

Thank you"

ohapvf,Have any of you gotten Pozzed on Purpose or knowingly had unprotected sex with a POZ person without caring if you caught it or not?!? I have always feared HIV and it's kept me from being a total 🐷slut. Recently a Dom said he'd POZ me up so I wouldn't have to be afraid anymore and I'd be free...,https://www.reddit.com/r/hivaids/comments/ohapvf/have_any_of_you_gotten_pozzed_on_purpose_or/,BisexualFag69,1,2021-07-09 20:05:22,11,/r/hivaids/comments/ohapvf/have_any_of_you_gotten_pozzed_on_purpose_or/,NaN,"Okay so I've been scared of STD's my whole life, the first time I had gay sex in college my friend gave me HPV. I have always fantasized about being slutty, and doing things like being a group bottom. But my fear of HIV has always kept the slut in me at bay. When I heard about club pitt, a gay sex club downtown I have wanted to go... unfortunately I found out about it after being in a committed relationship so I haven't had the chance. I'm now married to my husband and we are in an ""open"" relationship, I say it like that because he is very controlling and has all sorts of rules. For example I found a 23yo who is a great sexual match for me and I became his fuck buddy, at the time my husband was also making gay friends so he was cool about it. The 4th time I went over to my fuck buddies place my husband came with me, it was pretty clear my husband didn't like him... and my fuck buddy was more fem and classic gay than either of us and not really interested in the same things. So my husband and I had a fight, he basically said I had no interest in being this boys friend and it was all sex for me, I said yeah it's mostly sex but I do enjoy hanging out with him before/after too.. my husband said bullshit and started lecturing me on the fact we are open for friends that become sexual friends not for hookups. And anytime I meet a potential friend and fool around he slut shames me for being so easy, and plays the victim that he's not enough for me... which it's not his size or anything like that, our libidos are just way different I cum like at least twice a day and he cums maybe once a week... I often just feel physically ignored, and like I don't know how to initiate being sexual with him as it's totally random if he will reject me.... usually he does... I've also really become interested in bondage and being submissive / forced submission...


So a few weeks ago I was on grindr and this 56yo Dom from out of town is on and I send him a tap and we started talking... I told him about my interest in being tied up and forced into kinks and submission and even having multiple guys being invited to use me without telling me... I didn't even notice his profile said he was positive... he then says: I'll tie you up and gag you then wrap duck tape around your mouth so you can't speak even if you want to, then ill rough you up a bit while I wait for guys to come use you... and after you've been fucked raw by as many guys as we can get to come over me and my man will fuck you raw and nut inside you to turn you into a Poz Pig just like you wanna be. Once we Poz you you'll be free to be the slut pig you've always wanted to be.... nothing will be holding you back... and then once we're done well take the gag out and make you our toilet and then leave you filthy and used up...


I was so hard reading this, I had never considered being Pozzed a kink... or something anyone would want... but the idea of doing it on purpose to be free to be as sexual as you want without fear was such a turn on... I asked if they would feel bad about pozzing me, he said fuck no the brotherhood needs fresh blood... as if being poz was a badge of pride or some sort of club... I asked if they had ever done it before and he says tons of times... just last week we had a 19yo boy who wanted tied up  so we fucked him rough and hard raw and pozzed up then we had at least 25 guys come and fuck him and then we fucked him again just to be sure he was good and Pozzed... I was like holy fuck! I can't imagine getting fucked by 5 different guys in a row let alone 5 times that amount!!! I'd be so done after 3 guys lol... He says when your gagged and bound you can't say no to anyone... you just take it... I asked... did the boy enjoy it? Or was he in pain?!? He says fuck if I know when we finished we pissed all over him and the untied his hands and left the hotel.. he just collapsed and didn't take off his gag, to be honest I don't care if he liked it or if he was in pain we had our fun... I was so turned on... it seems like it would be terrible but it's sometime I do want to experience... and since then I can't get the idea out of my head of being Pozzed and Whored out to every willing cock...


I apologize if I trigger anyone struggling with this, but I'm Just curious if any of you willing got infected, or if after being infected if you feel more free to do whatever you want with whomever... or if any of you have this sort of gang rape experience"

I have few questions:

1- Will a person get HIV symptoms in the first week itself if their immunity is weak?

2- Can viral infections like HIV be detected during regular blood works? I got the results of my blood test particularly the lymphocytes and it seemed fine,

Unfortunately most of my life I lived in a small religious conservative town, so I don't have much information on HIV and other STIs except from my own research. At school we did not even touch on sex ed, we were only taught the usual ""abstinence"" type stuff. 

However, I've got some questions specific to HIV, as there's just so much conflicting information out there, it's quite a long list so you don't have to answer them all! 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is it true that people who are on HIV treatment live the same and even longer than people without HIV?
2. Does HIV medication produce any negative side effects?
3. Can you get HIV from objects, such as sex toys? (My assumption is that you can only get it if it is shared with someone else, but that risk is quite low as well)
4. Is this true, the chance of catching HIV from someone who says they're negative is higher than someone who says they're positive?
5. HIV impacts on the brain? I'm assuming if you're on treatment all of the symptoms won't show up at all

I’m writing about HIV risks, and somehow I’ve noticed some inconsistencies during my research.

So I went deeper into anecdotal evidence: 

One interesting story is from multiple college testing clinics reporting an absence of vaginal sex positive results for men. I know that ftm transfer risk is not that high, but is it supposed to be this low? 

Another is that I came across some women HIV+ support group leaders who make YouTube videos, and they apprantly have not given their male husbands or partners HIV over years of unprotected exposure before treatment. And they have not met a women who has infected their male partners.

Hope all is well, I'll try to make this short. I am in a tough situation and it’s actually causing damage to my friendship at this point. My best friend, pretty much my brother, has HIV. He was shockingly diagnosed back in early 2018. I have been there for him since the day he found out. In fact, honestly, I am the one who took it the hardest. I wasn’t exactly educated on the virus, so I was just very all over the place with my feelings and was afraid. He has remained externally strong throughout it all; he has his bad days, but I can count the number of times he has expressed his frustration with his diagnosis. I am the only one who is aware of his HIV status. So I decided to educate myself on it and do extensive research, and now I realize how ignorant I was and consider myself an ally (if that is even a thing). I feel like I could teach a class on HIV since I know so much about it. Lol

He REFUSED to get on meds as soon as he was diagnosed he had it. After doing my research, I knew that taking meds was the best course of action, and I assumed he would wait until more tests were completed and the diagnosis was confirmed. That wasn't the case at all. He wanted to heal himself “naturally,” so he altered his diet and began using herbs. It’s his body, and I am always a supported friend, so I didn’t do too much pushbacks until the blood results showed that his way wasn’t working. From 2018-2019, we got into A LOT of fights/disagreements about him getting on meds. I finally let it go because it was becoming too much for me, and it became almost a forbidden/taboo topic I knew not to bring up. 

2020 came along and another taboo topic came with that year, COVID. We hardly discuss it, but when we did, he would just say he isn’t that concerned and that he doesn’t trust the government. Again, no push backs from me, I would slightly engage, but I knew I couldn’t say too much. Earlier this year, 2021, he did some more blood work. The doctor came back and told him, his levels are so low, that he pretty much had AIDS. (That was kind of hard to write). FINALLY that made him get on Meds and he has been taking them ever since and he is undetectable now. After I found out about him having AIDS, apart of me felt as if it was my fault because I stopped pressing him on the issue for years. I told myself, I wouldn’t let that happen again. 

My friend is now refusing to get the COVID vaccine against all of his doctor's wishes. I understand the people who are anti vax, but considering the circumstance, I don’t know if he can exactly be “anti vax”. I got vaccinated back in April, hoping to inspire him secretly. About a week ago, he developed a cough and lost his taste, he decided to get a COVID test and that’s when I finally expressed my concerns to him, but we got into a HUGE fight. “It’s my body!” “I can do whatever I want” “I am taking care of my body!” “I have done research, what the media tells you isn’t true!”…some of the following things I heard. 

I am just trying to help, considering I am the only one who knows. We haven’t talked in 4 days, I have no clue what his COVID results are and I have tried to reach out. But all I got was “I am focusing on feeling better and healing. Well wishes”. I don’t kiss ass, so if someone wants space and I have tried to reach out, I give them space, sometimes 

Permanently. I feel a little disrespected, misunderstood and I am tired guys. I have tried my best to support him but I don’t know if I can anymore. I don’t know what to do at this point, and it’s starting to feel like our friendship, someone I consider almost my twin, is close to ending. I feel like I should be able to tell my best friend that I am concern and without all of this especially after dancing around the topic for so long. I know he must be dealing with things internally, and maybe I am being insensitive to that. I just don’t know what to do. Does anyone have advice? Maybe some studies on the COVID vaccine and HIV, that I haven’t seen? Any type of advice or words, I’ll take. Please let me know if I am in the wrong as well. Thanks."

A little confused…. I asked my doctor how I was diagnosed with AIDS when I was infected (infected sounds bad, correct me if I’m wrong for using this word) in September of 2019…. And he gave me an answer but with all the thoughts in my head, it was all going in one ear and out the other ear. Anyways, before I ask him again to clarify…. I wanna ask y’all your thoughts. 

I was testing negative from HIV all through 2017, 18, and tested negative April of 2019…. I wasn’t really active till I met this guy in July. We were messing around unprotected, not knowing he was very sexually active…. I didn’t get tested till Feb of 2020 which I was testing positive for HIV. Went to the doctors a few days later after the positive test and began treatment. Test results showed my CD4’s were 178. AIDS diagnosis followed. 

I then became undetectable within one month as my next blood draw showed I was undetectable. That was March 2020.

I’ve been reading that most of the time or whatever, HIV left untreated turns to AIDS in roughly 10 years?? Rare cases within 2 years?

Am I going crazy? I should really press my doctor but I just haven’t really asked as I tried to put this diagnosis behind me. I only bring it up when I meet someone that may potentially lead into a sexual relationship. 

Thoughts? I’m still new to this HIV thing…. So forgive me if I sound uneducated. I read articles but…. It’s all words to me. I can’t grasp."

Clinical data from American Gene technologies indicate that their clinical trial went on successfully and voted to go to phase 2 of clinical trials. Their gene and cell therapy could offer what is called a functional HIV cure. 

This is what is being done at American gene technologies as explained in the video below. The patient walks into a hospital and gives in 400mls of blood. HIV-specific T-lymphocytes are filtered and the genes on the coreceptor or CCR5 are edited to make them resistant to HIV infection. 

After a few weeks, the patient walks back and his/her genetically modified CD4 cells are infused back. The infused modified cells give the patient life long resistance to HIV and, the patient/client:

1. will never need to take daily HIV pills (ARVs)
2. will have an undetectable viral load for life, and so will not infect others through sex.

He has been telling us over the years he has some form of arthritis which is why he goes for 6month check up’s. He was also prioritised straight away for the Covid vaccine as soon as it came out here. We realised other people with arthritis were not getting it for a good while after. I was in his house and when I went to get cleaning stuff from the cupboard I noticed lots of bottles saying Genvoya…… really bad of me to do but I googled what this was. That’s when I realised it was to treat HIV. I know I should have never googled his personal belongings it was none of my business but I was very worried about him and I love him very much.  We are very close but I don’t know what to do next .. tell him I’m here for him or act as normal . He’s drinking a lot and he says he’s lonely too. I just dont want him to feel or be alone ! Sorry if this post is not allowed or if I have upset anyone ❤️

She said I'll be getting many calls from people.

I went to a local urgent care to get tested. A week later the results say I'm positive. Its an acute infection, I'm not sure what this means exactly. I haven't been retested yet or seen a Dr yet, I just got the results yesterday afternoon. 

I need to get a new primary care doctor,  mine recently left the practice at the VCU hospital. 

Obviously I'm scared, I don't know what to expect in my life and for my health yet. I just feel like everything is coming to an end, that eventually the hiv drugs themselves will slowly kill me or something and everyone in my family will slowly watch me die. I'm terrified.

What are the chances I'll become undetectable? What exactly does that mean?

My husband (we're in an open relationship) got tested yesterday and the initial test that took about 6-8hrs for the results came back negative by some grace of God. They're doing a secondary test that takes about a week to confirm the results and he's been put on Post exposure prophylaxis and truvada.  Surprisingly he doesn't want to leave me and has been amazing. His ex-boyfriend was also hiv positive so he has experience in dealing with this, however the ex was positive when they met.

Right now I'm still taking Tivicay and Truvada until I see another Dr this week. I was given these by the Nurse Practitioner at the urgent care after having a hookup the night before go further than intended,  this however isn't my first hookup and apparently I already had hiv. The last time I was tested was about 2 years ago. Idk how my husband tested negative considering we never use protection. 

Please give me some advice and tell me what to realistically expect. I'm mentally freaking out and am overwhelmed."

1. Tomorrow I will get analysis for identifying what therapy I need to get. The doctor said, they detected the virus very early and it will be easy to ""freeze"" the virus. What does it mean? I will start my therapy within a week-10 days.

2. Can I do sport? I am working out and wanna have a healthy life (it was even before finding out about my HIV status. There is no change for me).

3. I live in a very HIV-phobic society. The most scary part for me is to be marginalized by the society. Can I move to France to study? If yes, can HIV positive people from non-EU countries get free therapy in EU? I understand, that with my status, my only chance to build a family is moving to Europe. 

4. Will I have a normal life with HIV? Is it a ""big deal"" for ones who get therapy? I mean do you constantly live with the fear to die?"

At the time it sounded like a good idea and I didn't have a worry on my mind but now that I've sobbered up I'm actually panicking a bit. We met up and she started with a blowjob and I made sure I put on a condom. Honestly even in a drunken state I still tried to be very cautious knowing she does what she does for a living everyday. Now I'm panicking that because her teeth were putting pressure on the condom it might've actually damaged it in a way and allowed the exchange of fluids during intercourse since I didn't change the condom. We banged for a good 25 mins but towards the end I tried cumming on her face and she took off the condom but I wasn't 100% ready to bust just yet and told her to put it back on and suck me off for a few mins. She put it back on and here is where the confusion started after sobbering up. If she put the condom back on me inside out, meaning the outside part had her fluids on it, is there a high chance that in the 2-3 minutes that she sucked me off I could've gotten the virus? Even if it wasnt put on inside out, some of her fluids on the inside could've gotten in the inside part of condom and could that make me catch the virus? Or maybe when she rubbed her vagina she could have some fluids on her fingers and her putting it back on me could make me catch it? I'm legit panicking right now and my insurance is in the process of getting approved so PEP is out of the question. Any thoughts or suggestions?"

- chills throughout body
- swollen lymph node (size of pea in neck feels rubbery)
- pain and discomfort under right rib ever hour or so
- ulcers on penis
- ulcers in mouth and on tongue
- small red rash on hand
- severe headaches
- sore throat (week 7 til 8 and 12 until 15)

After a month I got tested and positive for microplasm genitalium. Treated with antibiotics and now gone.

I wasn't concerned too much until about 5 or 6 weeks in when the ulcers came in my mouth and tongue and penis. I took some herpes antivirals because I thought it may have been herpes and it cleared up. 

Came back again on penis took antivirals went away. 

Got tested at 10 weeks negative everything. 

Tested at 15 weeks nevative everything.


How conclusive are my results at 15 weeks post exposure? My doctor says it's impossible at this stage from that exposure but I'm still concerned due to my symptoms. 

Would taking antivirals at around week 4 and 7 have an influence on the HIV test?"

So this come from here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/hivaids/comments/nvyq1u/update\_aelix003\_hiv\_cure\_essay\_vaccine\_shots/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hivaids/comments/nvyq1u/update_aelix003_hiv_cure_essay_vaccine_shots/)

Hello everyone, i hope you all be well.

So  i just came from doctor. Finally the big day came: today i begin ATI (  analytic treatment interruption). It is the late phase of the study...  long study.

Since today i have  taken 10 doses of Vesatolimod and three shots of HIV therapeutical  vaccine. It has been during almost one year... Long and hard year. And  today is the last day taking the ART. A medication that i have been  taking for 4 years every single day. I feel anxious and a little sad but  i will finish the study no matter what.

Today  i met another person doing the same study. He said that he feel the  effects of vaccines and Vesatolimod a lot. Tired and feeling sick...That  comment made me feel like i am taking placebo, because no secondary  effects on me. That's make feel a little bit sad... but it is ok.

Somedays  i think that is better to be taking placebo, because in this case my VL  will rise soon and i will finish the study taking ART again. If i am  taking vaccine and VL do not rise, then i can be still six month on ATI  and it is too much, because i have to go to doctor every week, draw  blood, etc...

Also the rising of VL worry me in several levels:

\-worry that my reservoirs grow.

\-worry that mi CD4 go down and do not rise.

\-worry that affect my immunitary system.

\-worry that i can transmit the virus.

\-worry that be rejected by a lot of people.

Also  i do not have a boyfriend ( any volunteer? hehe), so sex will be  difficult during all this period. Saying you have detectable VL is not  very good argument to find people, and i dont feel confortable either  having sex and knowing i have detectable VL, i don't know.

On the other side, the AELIX-002 study results went positive, so this makes me feel good. It is a good idea for all of us:

That's all, i think. Any doubts or questions, i can answer in comments.

I hope you are all ok. we are here in summer times, so from a mediterranean beach i wish you all love, health and happiness."

It is said that 10% of HIV+ people worldwide are injection drug users, but that number goes up to 30% if you remove Sub-Saharan Africa from the equation. It is becoming increasingly apparent that, outside of SSA, IDU are in many ways becoming the new face of HIV. However, it is hard for me to find exact data on the intersection of injection drug use and HIV infection across different countries. What's more, injection drug use is largely cultural and says little about overall drug consumption in a given society, as in many parts of the world it is more common to smoke substances or ingest pills than inject. 

My big question is, outside of the EECA region, what countries have the highest HIV seroprevalence rates amongst injection drug users or which countries have injection drug users as a relatively larger portion of the total number of people who are HIV positive? Any help that could be provided would be greatly appreciated."

I visited a strip club where the stripper got pretty intimate however I did not perform cunnilingus aside from her shoving her ass in my face.  I stuck my tongue out briefly but I don't think I made contact. Then something really weird happened, which is no doubt the cause of my anxiety.. I licked her finger (I think she lightly fingered herself prior) and her nipple and while licking her nipple something got in my mouth. I don't know what it was but it was a small spec of something, kinda tasted like sweat/sour, and gross. I couldn't get it out so I guess I swallowed it. Anyway I have gingivitis (gums bleed when brushing teeth)  and I am really worried that I might of caught something.

I literally developed a sore throat while she was dancing and I swallowed that spec. I had flu like symptoms that night and still do (this was four days ago). I was tested for covid, that was negative and I'm just wondering what my odds are of catching HIV are..

I'll get tested ASAP but in the mean time Im just curious.

Day 11-heavy night sweats that wet my bedsheets for 3 nights in a row
Day 13- nausea ,chills,fever
Day 15- sore throat(mild),cough &amp; phlegm in throat for 2 days

I spent the next 3 months depressed as hell, I even put my semester on hold .

3 months came to an end and now it was time to test but I was so afraid to do so I delayed testing by 3weeks but one morning I woke up &amp; decided that enough was enough  I went down to a local clinic where I was pretty tensed but to my surprise I received a negative diagnosis"

The US funds medical treatment 100%.  These treatments are $3000 a month per person, with an estimated 1.1M US citizens living w the virus. 

I think HIV+ folk and activities need to take to the streets and voice a push for the cure. You hear Docs at HIV/AIDS conferences talking about how people are happy with taking their pills - that's bull, there's no other alternative to ARV (that includes monthly visits for injections).

If you ask me, the US needs to get rid of patent rights on HIV meds and allow a competition to grant three companies oligarchy power on treatment for a cure. End the profiteering from ARVs.

Yes, I basically forget I have it unless I’m chomping down on my meds, when I get a wound, or if I think about how I can’t join the military.

Otherwise my life is as normal as life is around where I’m from. I have a wife and son without them being infected because of modern medicine which is a huge medical blessing.


Long Answer with details of my life living with HIV:

I was born with HIV in 1988. My parents got it while doing drugs and because of the limited treatment back then they succomed to AIDs and died years after I was born.

My dad died when I was four years old and my mom when I was seven. My last memories of them are similar.
My dad rolled over in his death bed and said “I love you”. I remember I was visiting him.

My mom was in care and the last time I went to visit her she gave me a stuffed animal. She cried and said ""I ruined it I'm so sorry”. It was all she had to give me and she said that because she dropped her cigarette on it and it burned a hole in it.

It hurt to see my mom hurting like that, and that stuffed animal I cherished for many many years. I grew up with my grandparents afterwards.


Doctors didn't think I had a chance of living many years because treatment was limited. I even got to make a wish with the make a wish foundation and go fishing with Paul Newman at The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp!
But new medicines continued to come out that held AIDs at bay and kept the HIV virus from multiplying-as long as I took the medicine. If I missed a dose or two the risk of the HIV virus becoming resisitent to the medicine greatly increased.

I was told I had HIV when I was six years old. The first thing I thought was that I wouldn't have a wife or kids. That thought however didn't affect me too much. But slowly, throughout the years, mental effects of being born with HIV started to set in.


First, I was annoyed at having to take so many pills every night. Then, I started to like girls but I forced myself to never attach or pursue them because in my mind I wasn't allowed and they’d reject me anyway. Without parents and with HIV I started to feel not normal and didn't see where I fit in with anyone. With this secret I started feeling like a weird freak.
Then began the depression and hidden thoughts of suicide. 

I went through middle school and high school feeling more and more alone and misunderstood. It only got worse but I hid it well. I distracted myself by pursuing things that made me happy.
I dated a few girls I liked a few times but it only hurt to know/think I would just be immediately rejected by them once they knew. I pretty much was torturing myself as I believed I wasn’t ever meant to have someone that loved me back because of what I had. 

I couldn’t and wouldn’t live like a normal teenage guy because of being born with HIV, I couldn’t risk giving what I had to some girl I really liked. So, I focused on being around friends who I could live through their happiness and normal-ness. It was a blast.

But the depression and suicidal thoughts never went away. I had a huge void within. Once I discovered drugs it helped to fill the void temporarily. But only made life without being high much much worse (in my head).

The first time I really tried killing myself was after i told my first real 'serious' girlfriend what I had. Of course we had already been having mostly protected sex. It was a devastatingly HUGE mistake but thankfully she didn't get what I had. And she and her parents where very supportive and open and understanding….I told her over the phone (like a coward) and she was very upset and hung up. 

I thought that was it and believed I had truly ruined the life of the girl I loved at the time. I couldn’t face my consequences so I took all my medicine at once and drank a lot of bleach. I threw up shortly afterwords and was sick all night. Needless to say I couldn't smell bleach without gagging for over a year. 

Surprisingly We stayed together, she loved me back (something I thought was never in the cards) and she told me she was upset because she thought I was going to die.

Flash forward a couple years and she broke up with me over normal reasons. But at the time this really devasted me. I was in college and my emotions effected my grades and self worth. So began my second brilliant attempt at suicide.

I decided that if I could convince myself everyday to not drink water I would die and not regret the decision. But after 2 days I said screw it, drank out of a water fountain for five minutes and worked out my feelings through the gym and music. It was a refreshing day. Unfortunately, my grades were too far gone and I dropped out of college. So I worked and pursued experiences that made me happy.

This led to a few years partying with friends, marijuana, ecstasy, shrooms, cigarettes, and alcohol. It was fricking awesome. But because I wasn’t wise I let it lead to unemployment, repossessions, debt, and ultimately the loss of so-called friends.

Looking back it was unfair to think of them as ‘so-called’ friends, they had no idea what I was going through and they had their own fun to pursue yo. But it still hurt to feel alone and like I lost my friends. Especially ones who were cool as hell to hang with and always have a good time. In reality I just didn’t have money to chill with them and I was way to quiet and in my head. I was a idiot. Still kind of am.

But, I was back to feeling worthless and a failure. So came the third and final time I tried killing myself. I parked my GSXR 600 with a full tank in my studio apartment (Basement of a empty house) and turned it on hoping the fumes would let me sleep forever. But I woke up the next day with my motorcycle out of gas. I came to the conclusion I was meant to live, there was no way I could’ve with the bike being right next to my bed.

I was scrambled though. I figured I was meant to live but had no idea why and I hated it. After talking to a long lost child hood friend, (not about my suicide attempt) I felt called to God.
I went to church that following weekend and God showed hisself to me and he filled that void I had all my life. He reminded me of when I was a child and I first repeated the sinners prayer and was overcome with tears and peace that it was Him. He showed me that it was Him that I was seeking Him all along and that He never left me even though I forgot about that moment of accepting Him into my heart. With these versus-Jesus broke through and into my heart

“And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience— among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ— by grace you have been saved— and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.”
Ephesians‬ 2:1-10‬ ESV‬‬



It was Him that gave me peace when I was down, and it was in Him that I found a true purpose and meaning. Despite my circumstances He made me happy and content with everything.
I met my beautiful amazing wife a year later and I did the right thing by telling her what I had before getting serious. She wasn't concerned at all with me being born with and having HIV. I was so panicked when I sat her down to tell her. I imagined her screaming in shrill terror and running for her life, hands waving in the air. But it was very anticlimactic because of how unconcerned she was. Turns out she was more weird than I was, so I married her.

With Gods grace and modern medicine we were able to have TWO children naturally **without** her or my son and daughter getting HIV. They are such a awesome blessing. Undetectable equals untransmittable  https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/treatment-prevention


So in short, it is very possible to have a normal life. what wasn’t normal about my life was the depression-which surprise surprise can be a side effect of taking HIV meds….Thank you for letting me know that having/being born with HIV and taking meds might cause a bit of depression.


Anyway, as long as you keep taking your medicine to remain undetectable your life is as normal as can be. The only downsides to it are the mental/social stigmas. And Despite still struggling with depression every now and then, life is pretty normal and fulfilling.


I hope that one day modern knowledge and education about HIV will allow for the stigmas to be wiped out so that people living with this won’t feel the way I did."

On 2 August 2021, I got myself a pin-prick Gen 4 HIV rapid test and I was tested negative for HIV and Syphilis. 

A few days ago about 22nd Aug, I started experiencing flu like symptoms: No fever but feeling feverish, joint pain, muscle ache and diarrhea. No sore throat and runny nose. No night sweats or rash either. At this point, I started imagining the worst again. Every single symptom I experience is magnified and believed to be the worst. 

A day later, I experienced heartburn and tingling fingers with a mild burning sensation. At this point I was extremely stressed and worried sick.

Naturally things start to pick up and we do the deed. My gf recently broke up with me so I was a bit desperate. I figured I never really take this risk but it couldn't hurt, right? wrong. 

I may not be diagnosed with HIV but my mental state has suffered a lot from this. Fast forward about 2 weeks from then and me and my gf got back together, We had unprotected sex a couple times and I didn't think anything of it. At one point she confronted me, asking me if I had sex with someone without protection. Upon her confrontation it immediately hit me how absolutely reckless and selfish I have been behaving during this period of time. The guilt was overwhelming and made me physically ill. I got tested and it came up negative, my girlfriend ended up in the hospital for an unrelated sickness and got tested there too which also came up negative. Fast forward a bit and it turns out she developed the yeast infection which I also got which explained the symptoms during that time. 

Moving forward from then, I was riddled with health anxiety, a full in hypochondriac basically. I got yellow poop and my anxiety made me so tired I thought I was sick with something. Recently I overcame this anxiety and have been living a decently stress free life. I would occasionally notice flat red marks spotted on my body here and there but they would go away on their own and reappear but I never had so many at a time that I became concerned. I kept my anxiety under control.

About 2 weeks ago I got some of those red flat marks on my ankle, I payed them no mind but they refused to go away. 2 days ago those bumps have began to multiply and raise on their own. They aren't itchy or painful, they're blister-like. I chalked it up to a heat rash until my gf told me she was getting the same kind of rash on her ankles. I am keeping my anxiety at a low and going to the doctor tomorrow. But I can't help but wonder if my fears were right the whole time, and if I didnt give my girlfriend HIV when we first got together ive certainly given it to her by now.

Could a rash like this be unrelated to HIV? and is it possible me and my girlfriend just have the same rash on the same place as a coincidence? What are my odds of my test tomorrow giving me a false negative? I would really appreciate the help from you guys. I'm pretty scared of both HiV and becoming a full blown hypochondriac again."

I live in a ""red"" zone and I had much unprotected sex between the ages of 14 and 28 with 20 people, but the diagnoses of a thought-processing disorder followed by a manic-depressive disorder raises a red flag for me that they are either attempting to scare me away from having unprotected sex or they are continuing the requirement for Invega for a reason other than the psychiatric diagnosis. I have read a little about nurse's rights to lie in order to force a medication on someone, and it's just suspicious to me because I have been in court settings where a self-defense hearing had taken place after I was assaulted and the reaction of assault to the psych is deemable for a disorder where the assault itself is valid as a self-defense; where this would correlate with ""I didn't victimize myself or someone else, so I don't have a diagnosis"". It's not out of the realm of possibilities that I would be lied to, I'm a little more curious if the community has had a history of retaliation and receiving improper diagnosis of status because of it. I know one person who may have been born with HIV that has had mutual relationships that also raises a red flag for me.
