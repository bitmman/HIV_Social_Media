For example, are children in elementary schools aware? Do you get a good sex education in high school? And are your sexual health services free like ours or do you pay to access the service?
Any information at all would be very much appreciated! Thank you! "

a89mm0,Resources for Newly Diagnosed Individuals: Herpes (HSV) - HIV - AIDS - HPV - Asking to share,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualhealth/comments/a89mm0/resources_for_newly_diagnosed_individuals_herpes/,HonMyChest,1,2018-12-21 04:44:31,0,/r/sexualhealth/comments/a89mm0/resources_for_newly_diagnosed_individuals_herpes/,NaN,"Hi all - I host/produce the podcast, Something Positive for Positive People. This is a hub of sexual health resources that primarily consists of experiences of people living with, working with or affected by sexually transmitted infections/diseases. I'm unable to share this resource in many places that make sense as it is spam/self-promotion when I do it. Despite the importance of this information, places don't really care to have me 'talking about my podcast' on their platforms which I understand.

So I wanted to bring it here. This podcast is an emotional and mental support resource for people who get an STI and then get some pills and a pamphlet then sent on their way just as I was 6.5 years ago after my herpes diagnosis. It took me 5 years to find communities of others living with the virus. Those resources are challenging to find and I want people to be able to find them way sooner than I did. 

I share this here in hopes that someone who needs this sees it, and in hopes that the people who are comfortable sharing will do so before it's removed for self promotion because there are people who become suicidal and fall into depression just because they don't see past the present moment of their diagnosis and their feelings about it. 

I post episodes each week, there's 73 to date and the resources consist of people's experiences navigating relationships and dating, disclosing, managing herpes outbreaks, living with HIV, AIDS, access to support groups, sexual health facilities and organizations for condoms and STI treatment in addition to some bomb ass sex positive people to follow on social media.

I believe in this work I do and I've done it for more than a year now. The biggest challenge is that people don't want to share due to the fact they fear others assuming they have an STI because they share this information. In reality we ALL know someone living with an STI, we just don't know it. I believe this podcast is destigmatizing that through these experiences and resources being shared and it can contribute more if I'm able to show people with herpes that they do have a support system around them that is supportive and not critical/judgmental of them. This is my attempt to get people who don't have herpes/HIV involved by just sharing this to show support from the non-sti positive community.

Thank you everyone. And I'm gonna stay positive and hope for the best. . . . I don't have a choice to do otherwis haha."
