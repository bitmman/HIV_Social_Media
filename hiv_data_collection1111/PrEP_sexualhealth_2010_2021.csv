3z4evy,Should I recommend PreP for a sex tourist?,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualhealth/comments/3z4evy/should_i_recommend_prep_for_a_sex_tourist/,fruitheart,1,2016-01-02 00:44:31,2,/r/sexualhealth/comments/3z4evy/should_i_recommend_prep_for_a_sex_tourist/,NaN,"I met someone the other day who intends to have unprotected sex with several prostitutes over a couple of days overseas.

I was once on post-exposure prophylaxis. Should I recommend he obtain pre-exposure prophylaxis before going, since I doubt he'll be able to obtain post-exposure while overseas.

He refuses to just go to a doctor. Now that I've heard his story I feel morally obliged to help."

I know it's been awhile since we posted last, but I wanted to share another study Northwestern just launched.

It's a one time 15 minute survey Northwestern University is doing on PrEP and other new biomedical HIV prevention strategies. We want participants both living with and without HIV and we want a diversity of sexual orientations. The survey will also let you know if you qualify for other studies we are doing.

lo38k4,Currently on Truvada for Prep and having some gastrointestinal issues; would a Doctor prescribe me Mytesi?,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualhealth/comments/lo38k4/currently_on_truvada_for_prep_and_having_some/,harbstjc,1,2021-02-20 01:00:40,0,/r/sexualhealth/comments/lo38k4/currently_on_truvada_for_prep_and_having_some/,NaN,I have been dealing with watery bowel movements for awhile now and am wondering if thereâ€™s any change a doctor would prescribe me mytesi? I use Truvada as a form of Prep. I am currently on Medicaid so I am wondering if even if the doctor prescribes it would it be covered? I have tired other medications with no luck.
