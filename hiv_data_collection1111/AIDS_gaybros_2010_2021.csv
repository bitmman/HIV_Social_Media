**TODAY ALL DONATIONS ARE MATCHED (in multiples of $25)!!!**

We want to smash our record from last year, but more importantly, we want to help make sure AIDS Services of Austin reaches their goal of $195,000 (at $135,000 at time of post).

The funds raised from AIDS Walk help AIDS Services of Austin provide care for our brothers &amp; sisters fighting AIDS. Your donations can help provide warm meals, medications, beds, HIV tests, and much much more.

**PLEASE** consider donating $25 or more if you are able. I love this incredible subreddit and would love to be able to attribute some of our raised funds to you all! &lt;3

My mom found out a few days ago that I am gay and has since isolated me from my family. She's made a number of statements which reflect the mentality of earlier times (she thinks I am going through a phase/experimenting and that I can still be ""cured"") , but the quotation mentioned above ranks right up there. Considering her upbringing and the conditions she was raised in, I can understand where she could be coming from and her recent actions have become ludicrous, but unbearable. I am usually down to earth and just try to avoid getting in an argument with her about this, but now this is crossing the line and I want to do something about her attitude.

I love my mom and I wish she didn't make this so difficult. The reason I am making this post is because I don't know what to do anymore to try to make her see where I am coming from, but she continually refuses. At this point, I just want to give up but before I did that, I thought I could consult my fellow bromos. To those that have an opinion on this matter, what would you do in my situation?  "

It’s not going to be easy, but it’s likely to be one of the most rewarding weeks I will experience in my life. And I need your help to make it possible.

May 31st -June 6th I will ride my bike 545 miles from San Francisco to Los Angeles to support the life-saving services offered by San Francisco AIDS Foundation and the Los Angeles LGBT Center, in the fight to end HIV/AIDS. Preparing for this journey will require countless hours of training and preparation. I’ve committed my time to make sure that I’m ready, but I still need to raise a minimum of $3,000 to ride. For that, I’m asking you to support me by donating as generously as you possibly can. To the people who rely on these services to survive, every dollar counts. And every dollar brings me closer to being able to participate in this once-in-a-lifetime experience. 

In addition to this, I will also be making a personal contribution of $1000 towards organizations working to the betterment of weaker communities in India (Particularly those that work for poverty eradication and educating the society on LGBTQ rights) – so, every dollar you donate to me here is also virtually helping me make that contribution to other noble causes.

Thank you for making this event possible for me and for being the support that I need to cross the finish line on June 6th. Let’s make a difference together!

I wanted to reach out to this community for support. I am fundraising for The LGBT Community Center (gaycenter.org), specifically through Cycle for the Cause - the Northeast AIDS ride. All donations will go to treating and/or preventing HIV/AIDS.

Cycle for the Cause is an epic four day, 275 mile bike ride from Boston to New York in mid-September. It is an organized fundraising ride to raise funds and awareness in the fight against HIV/AIDS. It will also allow The Center to continue providing a safe place for LGBT people. My goal is to fund-raise $2000 this year.
.

All donations are SO SO SO appreciated, and I promise I will peddle my heart out on the ride for you.

You can donate at http://c4c16.kintera.org/hendrix

Find out more about the ride: http://cycleforthecause.org/

Message me if you're interested in joining the ride!

I have created a new community, called /r/ActUp to support a more pointed response to the clinical discussions that we have here.

The discussions about HIV here are valuable, but as the most recent HIV study represented (a study that showed that mixed couples don't transmit HIV, something that mixed couples have reported anecdotally for decades), we must have a place to discuss things that lead science to their conclusions besides simply being clinical and telling people that NO you're NOT HIV+. We need a place to be public, and be aggressive about our reaction to discrimination towards those with HIV and counteract those times and places. Please consider joining and contributing.

I decided to name the subreddit after the name of the famous reactionary group in NYC during the AIDS crisis because of their action and advocacy. If it's a terrible idea, then we can try a different approach with a same idea but a different name, and let me know.

I hope to see you all soon, and let's get HIV/AIDS to be a part of history!"

I've decided to ride in the 2018 AIDS/LifeCycle from SF to LA next June, and I'm wondering if any of y'all have done the ride in the past? If so, what are some tips? How was it? Are you doing it again?! 

For those of you who don't know, the ride is 545 miles and approximately 3,000 people participate, with all proceeds going to AIDS services in Sf and LA. You can learn more about the ride and consider donating towards my fundraising efforts here - http://www.tofighthiv.org/site/TR?px=3364623&amp;fr_id=2050&amp;pg=personal

Thanks!!

I got on Reddit just now to search this VERY topic and I want to share my two cents.  I offered up the following in another post, but thought it might serve well as a stand alone post.  If that's not allowed, mods do your thing....

It was a miss on Malek's part not to recognize the disease that took Freddie, a rock and roll legend and HIV/AIDS icon.   I'm not suggesting some sort of career controversy but it was a faux pax nonetheless.   Frankly, I'm scratching my head a bit as to how there wasn't a coordinated recognition and positive capitalization of this moment on the timeline of HIV/AIDS history especially given Elton John's place in Oscar culture with the AIDS Foundation after party.  I'm old enough to have a best friend who lost a brother\* to AIDS at a time of intense secrecy and isolation and even greater stigma.  A time when people wouldn't shake my friend's hand so they wouldn't catch the ""gay disease"".  I'm so grateful to have seen those days pass and we now see greater awareness and inclusivity.   Now we see medical treatments that can reduce the virus to a level of undetectable.  There are even meds (Truvada) available to help reduce to the chance of transmission.  But this is not a virus or disease to be slept on and I'm disappointed Malek did not use his platform to offer some acknowledgement of a disease that while not nearly as lethal still very much can be.  Hey, his speech was one of my favorites of the night.  People who remember to thank mom first always rank high with me. And, I thought the rest of it was sincere and heartfelt but this would have just been the most wonderful cherry on top.  If this was some sort of oversight associated with the nerves of being on TV in front of bazillions I will lighten up, but it just seems that it might have been pretty high up on the list of points of recognition.  I guess I'm just saying if people can remember to get in a well earned tRump jab, one might bring a little light to a lethal disease.   HIV is still a thing.  We still need to be reminded that it can be prevented.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I'm being overly sensitive, but it could be that AIDS was the ""polio"" of my generation.  While there is plenty to be grateful for there is much to be on guard for as well.  As we can see by the measles epidemics from Madagascar to Washington State, USA things will come back to bite ya in the ass (thanks anti-vaxxers - GFY).  We have to be vigilant.  Get tested.  You are wanted, needed and loved.

&gt;  
&gt;**After eight years of follow-up of the so-called serodifferent couples, the study found no cases at all of HIV transmission within couples.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**The study proves, the researchers said, that using antiretroviral therapy to suppress the AIDS virus to undetectable levels also means it cannot be passed on via sex, the researchers said.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**""Our findings provide conclusive evidence for gay men that the risk of HIV transmission with suppressive ART is zero,"" said Alison Rodger, a professor at University College London who co-led the research.**  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;The study, published in the Lancet medical journal on Thursday, assessed the risk of HIV transmission between serodifferent gay male couples - where one partner is HIV-positive and one is HIV-negative - who do not use condoms.  
&gt;  
&gt;Its findings add to an earlier phase of the study which looked at HIV transmission risk for serodifferent heterosexual couples in the same circumstances. It also found zero risk.  
&gt;  
&gt;**While 15 of the men among the 972 gay couples in this phase did become infected with HIV during the eight years of follow-up, genetic testing showed their infections were with strains of HIV acquired from another sexual partner.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Since the start of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, more than 77 million people have become infected with HIV. Almost half of them - 35.4 million - have died of AIDS.**

I remember what it was like at the end, when you could only see out of one eye, and your body was covered in spots. I remember when you walked into the bar on crutches and you were dead by 22. F*** you looked terrible and you caught it at 17. When I heard that Roc passed, I dropped to the floor of that nightclub in tears. 

There were so many who died. So many. So young, so young. I remember every week 'did you hear ____ died?' It was like a revolving door of death every week. Madonna's 'Take a Bow' played every Saturday night, as the dance floor was filled with tears. I was the lucky one, the late bloomer, the one who used protection.

It's been 25 years since I saw you my friends. 25 years since I laughed with you, saw you at the club, saw you enjoying life. It's been 25 long years since you died. 

Tonight you are in my heart, and in my memory. 

I hope you are someplace better, someplace happy. Please know that I was your friend, and always will be. Tonight, on this day, I miss you. 

Had you been a few years older, you would still be alive today, chatting with me on the phone instead of me sitting here honoring your memory.

On Aids day, please remember those friends we lost, those family we lost, and how important life truly is.

es7qm0,Much Of What’s Left Of The AIDS Generation— And Much Of What’s Left Of Me,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/es7qm0/much_of_whats_left_of_the_aids_generation_and/,silverlakebob,1,2020-01-21 21:54:25,37,/r/gaybros/comments/es7qm0/much_of_whats_left_of_the_aids_generation_and/,NaN,"By the AIDS generation I mean *my* generation. That is, those of us lucky enough to have emerged from the ‘80s and ‘90s with our bodies still intact (for a great many, just barely) but our souls more than ravaged. Did anyone hear the funny little quip making the rounds after the cocktail came out in 1996? “The good news is that I’m not dying. And the *bad news* is that I’m not dying.” Why, one might wonder, would anyone say such a thing? One unmistakable feature of the plague years was the decision of a large number of HIV+ men to drop out of the workforce, to quit their jobs, to get on disability, and to try to enjoy what little time they had left. There seemed little point to put in the work and invest the energy to advance one’s career with typical delayed-gratification maturity, because everyone knew that our promising careers (and everything else in our lives) would soon to be over. There seemed little point to plan for the future, as any normal adult naturally would. There seemed little point to save money or prudently invest for a better day, because that day was surely never coming. There seemed little point to think of anything but the present moment, which in any case was riddled with constant caregiving of those just a little worse off with that miserable malady of ours, and sullied by our chronic fear of what’s to come. So it was not at all uncommon to see guys run up their credit cards as if there was no tomorrow (oh wait, there *wasn’t*) and to live it up until they dropped.

But then came the rude awakening, the *wonderful* news, that we’re not all going to die after all. When they quite suddenly got a new lease on life, so many guys found themselves living on meager disability payments barely covering everyday expenses (and precious little else), residing in Section 8 apartments they could hardly stand, and pretty much unemployable given the many years they had been out of the workforce or had not worked at all. My friend Kim, well over 40 by that time, simply couldn’t bring himself to work in an entry-level position with nineteen and twenty year-olds and kept hoping he could pull off a miracle and land a higher-ranking job just as he had before— a miracle that never came. So he did nothing. I’ve met quite a few guys like Kim in HIV support groups I’ve attended: not working, horribly impoverished, barely making enough to keep themselves afloat in today’s unaffordable urban scene, suffering from physical ailments caused by prolonged side-effects of the HIV drugs, wanting to start anew but convinced that it’s far too late to even try, tired and hopeless and lacking ambition for something *(anything)* to brighten up their lives. Welcome to a large proportion of long-term survivors of the AIDS years. Welcome to a large proportion of what’s left of my generation. Welcome to the despondent “heroes” we all celebrate in theory but ignore in practice.

As for me, I didn’t fall into debt and for some reason didn’t completely give up on my future. I went to school and got a Ph.D during that frightful time. But I was still adversely affected by the fatalism. I wanted to write a book on something that enthralled me, and I focused almost exclusively on that instead of my future career. I never strategized with my professors on how to best land a job because I assumed that I probably wouldn’t be needing one. I just wanted to write that book before I croaked, and, to my ever-lasting joy, I was able to do it. So once I graduated I didn’t get a great academic job that I perhaps could have gotten had I been more strategic and spent more time networking, but I was (and am) in a much better position career-wise and financially than are so many HIV+ guys of my generation.

Likewise, the fatalism quite assuredly affected me in my personal life. I put up (and then some) with an abusive, sociopathic boyfriend because I fatalistically thought that no one else would have me. (Who in their right mind, I thought, would in the mid-1990s take on another relationship with an HIV+ person after having watched so many die??) I gladly gave him more and more money because, let’s be honest, *I* wasn’t going to need it. (I didn’t fully realize that I was a slow-progressor and genetically more resistant to the virus until the very end of the 1990s.) So, even though I’m far more fortunate than are so many guys who are stuck in horrible poverty and bored with their lives, I’m still right there with them with my own adverse effects of having lived through the plague years. My soul is just as ravaged as theirs.

But not for much longer! I’ve had it up to here with wasting my time and energy on past regret and I’m eager to celebrate my being alive! This year, I’m happy to tell you, is going to be *a wild ride* as I embark on a sexual/romantic comeback that will put the poets to shame— a comeback ever so enhanced by my renewed muscular, slim body. I now weigh, I’m proud to report, under 180 lbs. for the first time in twenty-five years, only a few pounds away from my long-term goal of 175— and that’s with all those newly shaped, weighty muscles [I’ve been working so hard to get this past year](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskGaybrosOver30/comments/dlry8m/its_been_a_full_year_since_i_started_working_out/).

But I need some company! I encourage all of my long-term survivor bros (and everyone else out there) to decide not to wait another day, to start working on shedding those pounds and getting back into shape, to come on board and join me on that wild ride, and to never, *never* give up. Because after all we’ve gone through, it’s just not allowed."

On World AIDS Day nobody fucking talks about living with the stigma of hiv and aids. I'm 2018 an estimated 37.9 million people were living with hiv worldwide and no one is talking about the crisis of stigma.

Stigma is becoming more dangerous than HIV. I wonder how many people have died from the stigma surrounding HIV. How many people have taken their lives, unable to cope. How many people are starved for touch or even conversation once they reveal their diagnosis.

World AIDS Day is a day that had lost its potency if it can't help those currently suffering.

How many people have you blocked on apps, ignored, or swiped left on because of their status. It's not because you're afraid, it's because you're ignorant.

Every year 3,000,000 users visit Parni PLUS. The portal's publications cover the topics of health, relationships, lives and lifestyles of LGBTQ people.
On 1 December 2020, against the will of its creators and editors, Russia's Ministry of Justice included the portal into the register of foreign agents, i.e. the list of organisations involved in political activity and receiving funds from abroad.
On 20 May 2021, we, the Parni PLUS team, were fined for refusing to comply with the decision of the Ministry of Justice and for insisting that they cannot be treated as foreign agents because in fact they are not involved in any political activity. We have taken legal action and have filed a lawsuit against the government. We are fully aware we are bound to lose the case but it is a matter of principle for us.
After the website was included into the foreign agent registry, it was unlawfully banned by Roskomnadzor, Russia's Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media which is the Russian federal executive body responsible for compliance with the law in media and telecommunications. In April, we managed to fight Roskomnadzor's decision in court and to get the website working again. However, after that we started receiving threats from far-right activists and unknown individuals who demand we shut down the website, otherwise they will cause us physical harm.
Right now we have to raise 300,000 roubles (4500 USD) by the end of July in order to continue working as a LGBTQ media outlet. Right now one more independent media outlet in Russia is at risk of extinction. Right now a reliable and vital source of information for Russian LGBTQ people is on the verge of dying out.
You can help us survive and continue fighting against homophobes and against governmental pressure by making a donation on our crowdfunding platform.
