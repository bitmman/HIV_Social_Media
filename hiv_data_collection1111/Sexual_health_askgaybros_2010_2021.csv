So thanks again!


Please help me here, I think/know this is an utterly unsafe practice. However I cannot easily find a credible resource that states the risk of this particular practice explicitly. Most state the higher HIV risk in homosexual male sex broadly.

To clarify: he believes it is only if you are analy penetrated by an HIV+ man, that you are at risk. Whereas he himself as HIV-, is at no risk penetrating whomever anally. This is notwithstanding that South Africa has amongst the highest AIDS rates!

Any links explicitly addressing all the differing manners, in specific detail, that HIV can be transmitted in male homosexual sex is most appreciated. I am very thankful for this forum as a goto resource.

So I'm not sure if this is the right place to post but I needed some advice. Hope this isn't too weird.
I've recently just gotten out of a year long relationship with my bf. We lived together and things were great but due to circumstances beyond our control it didn't end up working out.
Anyway, I've never been one for hook ups and he's the only person I've slept with in more than a year. He has had alott of partners before me and I recently found out that he may have had a once off hookup with somebody else while we were together... Sad day, but life goes on. I'm super paranoid about STDs so go for regular check ups and have always been clear. In the past month I noticed a slight raised bump at the base of the shaft of my penis - something that could totally be a normal skin defect that I have never noticed or it could be something more. It doesn't hurt and isn't red or anything.
I know HPV doesn't show up in regular tests and I haven't been vaccinated so it could be a possibility.
I don't know if I should give it a couple weeks to see if anything else develops /if it goes away, or if I should go see a doctor.
Any of you guys had similar issues / can give me insights into HPV.
Thanks!
TL/DR: STD checks came up clear but recently noticed a little bump at the base of my penis. Should I be concerned?"

Turn away now if you don't care what I have to say having disclosed that.

I gave in to the homosexual temptations and hooked up with this guy. We has sex maybe five times over the next three weeks. 9 months later I work up the courage to go to a gay sexual health clinic because of STD paranoia.

So I'm so nervous that I'm literally shaking and basically covering my head with my hands in shame. I get called in to speak with the nurse and she pretty quickly notices how uncomfortable I was.

She asks me to tell her what sexual acts I had done, to which I kinda froze and she told me that it's a judgement free zone or whatever. After covering my face with embarassment I told her anal/oral sex and she asked me if I was being penetrated or the opposite to which I said I was the one being penetrated.

It was at this point where she asked me if I enjoyed it. She told me to be honest with her and straight up say it. After that she asked me if I'd do it again and when I said I'd never have gay sex again she told me that she hoped I would. 

What the fuck?

Is this not crossing a line? What does that have to do with testing?

She then made me say I had ""recepetive anal sex with another man"" before telling me that there's nothing wrong with that. This was while knowing how uncomfortable I already was.

Then the bloods were taken etc. and as I was leaving she told me that she hopes I become sexually active again.

I don't understand why or if this is even ethical. Can I report her? How? Should I? Please give me some advice.

I live in London, and like any big city its a cesspool of casual sex in disease - and I regularly dip my toe into said cesspool. However I am lucky that the city also has excellent sexual health provision for gay men. As a result I get a full sexual health screen once every two to three months, get immediate and effective treatment when either I've got an STD or someone I've been in contact with says they have one. 

In fact the last time I went it was because someone  I had slept with said that someone he had slept with had got syphilis - technically the protocol if its not contact with someone who *definitely* has it is testing rather than precautionary treatment, but the doctor I saw agreed that waiting 1-3 months to see if it showed on testing or I had symptoms was unrealistic if it meant no sex at all (glad I didn't get a judgemental one!) so just treated me anyway.

And all of it has been free - even the prescriptions (not sure why, usually there is a flat charge for these). It kind of still blows my mind.

I feel a little guilty that I use the NHS so frequently to support my own lifestyle choices, though on the other hand I have a good job and pay a fair bit of tax. And these are not exactly expensive tests and treatments.

But this got me thinking - what is public provision for this sort of thing like in America (and elsewhere)? Are there any free clinics? If you have to go via insurance are most sexual health tests and treatments covered? If you are young and on your parents' plans, do they find out what you have claimed for?"

I have been struggling with depression for about 8 years now, as a kid I believe I had phases where I was unreasonably melancholic for a kid. Ive used anti depressants, anti psychotics etc, multiple psychiatrists and psychologists. Recently I came back from a failed attempt at a master‚Äôs degree in a EU country( Im not from EU or America). I got so unhappy to a degree that i feel like im at the end of my rope-figurally and literally. Im the only kid of my parents, grew up shy and isolated, ive had my first sexual relationship with a prostitute lady at age 20. Im now 25. Ive had a girlfriend whom I love for three years as of now. As i mentioned I am at the end of my rope and would not like to continue living like this if i dont find the reason behind my depression and change it. Im not even emotional about it or something, life simply isnt worth it, the negatives outshine the positives by a huge margin. But i recently realized that I am suppressing the hell out of some parts of my sexuality. I start to believe I used studying and nerdery as a ruse so as not to even think about sex in general. As a kid with my friend we used to touch each other‚Äôs penises. Until high school i used to have ‚Äòminor‚Äô crushes for my male friends. Never had any sexual interaction with a man so far. I used to watch shemale porn. Im saying these so someone might recognize a pattern or something i dont know. Really interesting thing is, phenomena that I‚Äôve seen as morbid anomalies proving that I am cripplingly depressed/ autistic/ cue more diagnoses here, might as well be outcomes. I always was shy, and one complaint of mine was that ‚ÄòIm not good with women‚Äô so to speak. Im not good at flirting, hook ups, etc. And I start to think that, what if its not that I can‚Äôt but rather I don‚Äôt want? I surely get aroused by women and have a nice sex life with my gf. But I believe I would have intercourse with a feminine-y male. It‚Äôs just that all my life Ive never looked into my sexual orientation to see what I enjoy and this is new to me. I‚Äôm just scared thats all. The thing that prompted all this is an inquiry: itself prompted by the extreme state my depression has taken itself to. Any and all input is welcome at this point.

Anyway, about the end of September my partner of 9 years now had a stroke. He is 29 years old. It was a hemorrhagic stroke. This means he had an artery bleed in his brain. Long story short he went through surgery which was a success but now has a stent to help the blood flow through his brain. I'm sure many will ask how he's doing. Honestly he's already okay'd to drive again and the only defect is his hand feels like pins and needles on the left (it was a right side stroke). For those that don't know, that's an insane recovery and I feel blessed every second he wasn't taken from me.

 So I have some anxiety about us being intimate. Before the stroke we were very open to being rough with each other and now I'm afraid to even do missionary. We had sex for the first time in a while last night and I was so worried that it would cause another blood leak. I did read a little and saw that it's possible that rise in blood pressure could cause another bleed and sexual intercourse rises your blood pressure. Can anyone that has been in this situation give me an in depth response about that? I thought maybe we could do it with him lying on his side to avoid his head from moving so much but there's still the question of if we should be having sex at all. From what I understand an orgasm could cause the same and we regularly do things that aren't actual intercourse. It seems to be fine and he's also quit smoking cigs and weed (well he's trying really hard with that but has cut back insanely he does slip up). And we are dieting and eating a lot of post-stroke healthy foods.

Does anyone know if there is an actual risk here? I'll take any information I can get. Of course we'll talk to his doctor and perhaps some other sources if we can but our doctor is a straight female. Not that she wouldn't know about homosexual sex health but I'm curious of what some fellow gay men have to say. 

Also to make it a little easier, if he falls at all, even catches himself or just sits down we have to go to the ER for a scan immediately. I'm starting to think actual sex isn't worth it."

Talking about religion and sexuality can be a touchy topic for many people. Many same-sex attracted people struggle to navigate often conflicting spiritual and sexual identities. Navigating conflicting identities can often lead to increases in such problems as depression and substance abuse.

There is limited research, however, studying the differences potential differences between affirming and non-affirming religious or spiritual beliefs and how these differences may affect the mental health of people who are attracted to the same gender.

BRACE is investigating different aspects of sexuality among individuals who self-identify as asexual, bisexual, gay/lesbian, or heterosexual, although we are currently only recruiting men (cis and trans)! The reason why we're only recruiting men at this stage is because we have fulfilled our recruitment goals for women/non-binary folks.

This world-wide study involves completion of an online self-report questionnaire package at any time convenient for you. Participation in this study will require no more than 40-minutes of your time and you will be compensated for your time.

Even if you are in a trusty ‚Äúmonogamous relationship‚Äù.
2. Find out where you have access to an Infectious disease Doctor near you.
3. first you need to get tested for STIs And find out which ones are negative. The bare minimum should be HIV, VDLR (Syphillis), Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C. Every Six months. Every Three months if you have &gt; 1 partner. If you had bareback sex, an HPV exam from your asshole or penis (depending if you are top/bottom/vers)  would be suggested.
4. Get Vaccinated. Get your shots of Gardasil-9 (HPV Vaccine), Hepatitis B, Hepatitis A vaccine. If you have the resources also get the typhoid vaccine and meningococcal vaccine. All These protect you from the most common STIs: Diseases with skin contact: penis/anal warts, penis/anal cancer, Rimming diseases: Hepatitis A, Typhoid, oral HPV
5. Get your labs done to see if you can use PrEP. Blood Count (CBC), Metabolic Panel (Comprehensive Metabolic panel), Urinalysis, Lipid panel + your STI tests (specially important to find out that you don‚Äôt have Hepatitis B to access PreP)
6. PrEP can be used in two ways, Continuous or on demand, Both reduce the chance of getting HIV &gt; 98%. If you got 2 or more sexual encounters per week, you could take it daily. If you have sex Once a week or less(1-2 times a month or less) taking it on demand would be adequate.
7. You can take Antibiotics before having sex to reduce the chance Of catching Chlamydia And Syphilis. Taking Doxycycline 100 mg daily Reduces 70% chance of contracting Syphillis and Chlamydia (you could still get it though). You could also take a single dose of 200 mg of doxycycline 24-72 hours after bareback sex, however it is not as effective. [These studies](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/70/6/1247/5557867) are  Recent, and have low level of evidence, but they look promising for preventing these STIs. If you catch them by any chance getting tested will help you with early detection and treatment (‚Äòcause those are curable)  

8. The most common STIs that don‚Äôt have any kind of protection with vaccines or PrEP are crabs, Herpes (skin to skin contact) , and Hepatitis C (preseminal fluid, semen and cumming inside In anal sex). Hepatitis C is common Among drug users, so if there is a Slam (drugs and sex) going on, I would suggest you to use a condom or do something else (a handjob lol)
9. after this you can somewhat enjoy bareback sex, if you have any doubt, bring a condom.
10. The only one responsible for your sexual health is YOU. Protect yourself and contact your infectous diseases doctor. TRUST NO ONE. The only way to reduce the chances is taking your vaccinations, your prep, your condoms. Be informed and prepared.
11. enjoy your sex life."
noll70,How to talk to long term partner about sexual health,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/noll70/how_to_talk_to_long_term_partner_about_sexual/,s1jile,1,2021-05-30 14:54:37,3,/r/askgaybros/comments/noll70/how_to_talk_to_long_term_partner_about_sexual/,Advice,"I'll try to keep this short...

I should preface this by saying that I have extremely bad anxiety (social, health, and performance anxiety), depression, and body image (in recovery from bulimia).

My long-term partner and I are 'college sweethearts' and also terrible communicators. I mention this because we have has very few conversations about our sexual health histories other than knowing that we were both pretty inexperienced when we got together. The way we got together was this kind of gay love narrative ‚Äî lots of romantic tension, on and off 'friendship' with each other, and a small handful of hook ups over the course of our undergrad. When we finally started dating, it was like we were devoted to each other for eternity. I don't even think the thoughts on having these serious conversations. This is the first serious relationship for both of us. For 85%, we have been aware of what the other person is doing since we lived together straight out of graduation and then spent soo much time on Facetime when I moved.

Fast forward some 3 and a half years, the pandemic, long distance (I'm in Canada and he's in the US), and other personal things have come in between us. As of now, we are committed but also dealing with the idea that things may not work out. We had a very short period, maybe a month or so, of being in an open relationship, but it didn't really work out for us. Now that I am working on my mental health and with the normalization of getting tested for covid, I've been thinking about getting an std/hiv test. I understand that our commitment to each other, lack of symptoms, or the fact that I'm a huge prude and have had few sexual encounters besides him cannot mean anything unless medically examined. I have never had unprotected sex other than with him and have never had anyone else's c\*m near my mouth (working on that sex anxiety part lol). 

In the case we have the conversation of going break, I am happy with him seeing other people while I focus on my mental health. Before that happens, I feel like the responsible thing to do is get tested. I fear the conversation because there is a high chance that he will get ahead of himself and attach this conversation to our relationship as a whole, which would make sense, but knowing him, he would assume that we are breaking up or something. I'd also feel weird planning or going to a test without his knowledge or him being on the same page. I guess I'm wondering if anyone has experienced this kind of conversation with a long term partner? I feel like a lot of sexual health questions I see here are about a new bf or a recent hook up, but not much comes up from existing relationships. I may honestly send an email so it gives him time to manage his thoughts before he responds. Any advice?"
