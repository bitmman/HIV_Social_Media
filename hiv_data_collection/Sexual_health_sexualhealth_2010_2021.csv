I've been with my boyfriend for three years and I just... can't get off no matter how hard he/I try. I used to watch porn on a daily basis and I used to push on my clit really hard when I was masturbating but latetly I haven't been able to get sexually aroused (wet) when I masturbate so I gave up porn and masturbating. When my boyfriend goes down on me I can feel him on my clit but i'm overly sensitive and it kinda hurts in a weird way? It's like i've trained my body to only respond to my touch (and even now I can't even do that) and I don't know how to undo it. 
Just as a background I get very aroused when it comes to sex so there's no issues there I just can't cum or get myself off. This has been bugging me for years and I feel sorry for my bf because I know it frustrates him!

So before anyone asks, yes I have been to a urologist just a week ago and everything is fine. He said that I was OK and that my testosterone was in the higher levels. 
I lift weights three times a week and no I don't do steroids (the urologist asked about that too). 

So i'm gonna make this short in order to not generate a wall of text. 

1. I'm 27 and still haven't had sex. Been naked with a girl once in bed but was too drunk and hopped up on whip its to get anywhere. 
This experience was around four years ago. Haven't had any close experience since. 
Oh, wait there was this one time when an attractive middle aged university administrator gave me a hint compliment about my body. 
After that my mind was like: ""Whaaaat? A compliment?""

2. I feel like zero desire for sex and this freaks me out. But not really. I just find it odd. It's like everywhere I look I go ""meh"" to every girl. 

3. To be honest I have really stopped thinking of women as sexual beings. Not completely but they always seem so distant for me to engage in anything more. 

4. Random erections are not really a thing I get anymore. They are not completely absent can show up if I happen to imagine something but they never stay around. 
Compare it to a motor: 
The pistons are going but the spark plugs don't give off any sparks to ignite anything. 

5. I never have erections in the morning. Ever. 

6. Whenever I masturbate it's never really that much desire in me to be honest. Half of the time it's a way to calm down. 

7. Whenever I get an erection, once I have pre cum come out my hard on goes away. I can get it up again but like I said: The desire isn't really there. 
This of course is now getting on my nerves since I start getting afraid of the first time i'm supposed to have sex and won't be able to get aroused. 

8. I'm not really around that many people except the people I study with. Closeness to anyone, even hugging a dog or a cat, isn't really something that exist in my life. 
Although I'm not socially akward or anything I don't know where to go to be social. "

So, I feel the need to preface this by giving some background information. I am a 26 year old male with a highly laborious job working, on average, 60 hour work weeks. I have been in a stable relationship for 7 years in March, and I proposed in April of this year. I've been on Adderall for about 5 years now, and have been working with my doctor to establish lower dosages in attempts to wean myself off. My fiance and I have a healthy sex life, and aside from a 2 year rough patch (when I was pretty bad off on Addy, working night shift at the same job I have now, not sleeping for 2 or 3 days straight), it always has been. We typically have sex at least once a week, which I feel is a typical amount considering we both work ridiculous hours and typically only have 1 day off a week together. 

The question I have pertains more to me than to her. Is it ""normal"" (for lack of a better word) to stay extremely horny for a few days to a few weeks on end, even with a pretty much daily ""release"" either from myself or with her assistance? My sex drive has steadily increased as my dosage decreased, which I expected since it decreased as my dosage went up. But now, I take 5 mg IR tablets 4 times daily (started on 30 mg XR and 10 mg IR once daily, then dropped to 25/10, then 25/5, 20/5, 15/5, to current dosage), and I get so horny on a daily basis that if I don't cum before bed, I wake up with blue balls and I'm in a terrible mood the entirety of the next day (or until I do cum). 

Even during the peak of my sexual activities in prior years, I have never had this severity nor frequency of ""issues"" in my life. 

I don't particularly feel that this alone is cause for concern, but I feel that left untended (for lack of a better word), it could either develop into something more serious such as a porn addiction, or could  cause a rift in our relationship if the sexual activities become  too infrequent (from my perspective) or frequent (from hers). I don't feel that infidelity would ever be a concern, just the rift leading to arguements or resentment, neither of which I care to add to our otherwise healthy, happy life together.

I greatly appreciate any and all input this community may have, and look forward to being a new member of the Reddit community."

&gt;A chemical found in the world’s most widely used weedkiller can have disrupting effects on sexual development, genes and beneficial gut bacteria  at doses considered safe, according to a wide-ranging pilot study in rats. 

Not just in Rats

[A Weed Killer Is Increasingly Showing Up in People's Bodies](http://time.com/4993877/weed-killer-roundup-levels-humans/)


&gt;For now, Mills says the findings should make people more aware of what they are ingesting along with their food. While Roundup was developed to eliminate most weeds from genetically modified crops — and thus reduce the amount of pesticides sprayed on them — recent studies have found that many weeds are now resistant to Roundup. That means growers are using more Roundup, which could only exacerbate potential negative health effects on people who consume those products. Eating organically grown produce may help to reduce exposure to some pesticides and herbicides, but it’s not a guarantee that the products are completely free to potentially harmful chemicals.

&gt;“From my perspective it’s remarkable that we have been ingesting a lot of this chemical over the last couple of decades,” says Mills. “But the biomedical literature hasn’t said much about its effects on people. That’s a gap that we endeavored to address and bring more awareness to with this study.”

Hey guys, so I’m using an anonymous account because of the fact that I feel I need a little more privacy with this one. So I’m a 15 year old boy with generalized anxiety disorder. I’m worried I hypnotized myself into being a pedophile. I occasionally go into what feels like a hypnotic state where I then feel like I’m super suggestible. Idk if I actually went into hypnosis but I feel as if I did. Then I thought of what one of my biggest fears would be and that is being a pedophile so surprise! I feel like I made myself one by suggesting it to myself, I felt it sunk into my subconscious and now I have attraction to kids.

Guys I really wanna get rid of this, I would bring this up to my therapist but I’m worried they’d break confidentiality. Is there anything I can do about this? I’m super super scared!"

Im 19, female and on the autism spectrum (asperger's syndrome particularly). Please, don't be rude about this and keep things mature, because I'm genuinely seeking help. While I'm a virgin, I'm a very sexually driven person. I've been having concerns lately that my sensory processing disorder (in relation to my autism) may be impacting my sex drive. I have a great deal of difficulty tolerating being horny and I'm quite literally always turned on to some degree. I think it may have something to do with my hypersensitivity to various stimuli. While this may be a logical explination, the idea scares me, because I obviously can't get rid of my autism and I'm unsure how to stop this. It's gotten to the point where I'm masturbating every day, usually at least five times a day just so I can function even slightly. My sleep schedule is ruined, I haven't been attending school (though there are many other factors involved with that), and I always feel disgusting and dirty. Is there any way my extremely hyperactive sex drive could be related to my autism, and is there any way to fix it?"

I am in the beginning stages of building an online platform that will assist women with their sexual health concerns/frustrations. It would be absolutely amazing if you could help me out by taking a quick 10 minute survey in order for me to best find out what my fellow ladies actually need and how I can best serve you. I would be super grateful for every entry ❤️. I am NOT TRYING TO SELL ANYTHING. This is purely for RESEARCH.

I don't know whether this is the right place to post this or not, but I wanted to ask.

So when I was 19 I dated a guy who was sexually and emotionally abusive. Not long after we broke up, he forced himself on me and assaulted me. I found out a couple years later during a gyno checkup that he'd also given me HPV. Thankfully I have the vaccine, so the strain isn't as likely to give me cervical cancer, but the doc found abnormal cells on my cervix during my first pap smear and now I have to get them every year until it either clears up or gets worse and warrants treatment. 

I hate gynocologist checkups. Nothing against the doctors, they're just doing their job, but I always feel so gross afterwards. I had one today and it was rough. I've never liked them ever since my assault, but since having to get pap smears done they've seemed a lot worse. I just feel more violated I guess? Not to mention that they're painful no matter who you are or what your past is. I can't even have sex anymore without pain due to my mental trauma, and having something stuck up in there and scraping around is excruciating for me. I always end up going into a mild panic or anxiety attack after my gyno visits so they suck mentally as well.

I just had one today (I'm only 23 so I'm still really new to them) and I've been out of it since I left the doctors office. I've just been kind of shell shocked since my appointment and have had to take the rest of the day off to just lay in bed and calm myself. And aside from me hating the touching and prodding even though it's consensual, I feel like the paps get more painful every year.

Does anyone else who's survived sexual assault deal with this? Does it get better? How do you move past it if anything? Therapy? Medication? If I disclose to my doctors about my rape will they do the checkups differently? (Only my therapist from college knows about it, none of my other doctors). I dread having to go through this every single year, it's so physically and emotionally painful for me. Any advice is greatly appreciated."

Testosterone plays a role in a wide range of bodily functions, affecting areas of the body like bone and muscle health and sperm production in men or sex drive in women. The importance of testosterone production cannot be overstated, and, for some individuals, testosterone levels are so low that they suffer from hypogonadism, or Low T, which requires clinical treatment by a medical professional.

Add Specific Foods That Boost Testosterone to Your Diet

For others, testosterone levels are just lowering naturally. In some cases, natural methods can be applied to boost testosterone levels slightly. One such method is eating foods that boost testosterone because they’re high in certain nutrients. Vitamin D may help boost your testosterone levels, and Zinc may also increase your testosterone levels (check out the studies here for more info). Fighting cortisol, the “stress hormone,” may also help boost your testosterone levels. While many other nutrients may affect your testosterone levels, we are going to focus on foods that either affect cortisol or contain Zinc and Vitamin D because more evidence exists for these methods than anything else. Try adding these 5 foods that boost testosterone to your diet.

Milk with Vitamin D

This one might be so obvious that you miss it completely! Most of us have some milk in the fridge, and we might even refer to whole milk as “vitamin D milk,” but actually most store bought milk has vitamin D added to it (although raw milk and some organic milks may not be fortified with this nutrient). Adding a few glasses of milk to your diet a week may help boost your testosterone levels.

Shrimp

Who said boosting testosterone was going to be cheap? Seafood in general has a variety of health benefits, but shrimp in particular contains high levels of vitamin D. As one of the foods that boost testosterone levels, shrimp may improve your testosterone while helping thin your waistline. Consider adding shrimp to a meal once a week.

Oranges

This one’s a little more affordable! Cortisol levels may drop in response to vitamin C, so add this vitamin C rich food to your diet to fight cortisol and boost testosterone.

Beans

Beans have a variety of health benefits (they’re low cal and high in protein for a start), but they also have high levels of zinc. And they’ll offset all that money you’re spending on shrimp. Try replacing a side dish like mac and cheese with beans once a week.

Pumpkin Seeds

When you’re reaching for a salty snack, reach for pumpkin seeds instead of the crackers. Not only are they inexpensive, but their high levels of zinc can help push your testosterone levels up.

Spinach

I guess popeye had it right all along! Spinach is rich in magnesium and vitamins C and E. In the same study on Zinc mentioned above, the same researchers also found that magnesium may help boost testosterone levels. This may be one of the better foods that boost testosterone because it fights cortisol at the same time. Consider eating spinach once a week to add these key nutrients to your diet.

I didn't think much of it cause I was able to climax moments later and I felt no pain/saw no swelling or anything.. days later tho, I noticed erection was harder to achieve/keep and I'd gone numb down there... I've also started struggling with severe anxiety and other mental problems during this time ...


Update: my penis is still overall the same but I feel like my sex drive and arousal have improved a bit? ..still getting hard flaccids, erection is still harder to gain and keep but when I do gain a full one, it's very firm.. penis still looks more curved than normal but only when semi erect, And I'm still numb... Morning wood has kinda returned but still it's mainly when I'm lying on my left side, and when I'm standing straight up, my penis will fill with blood but never really goes up. Still no pain or swelling thankfully but my penis still has that ""hourglass shape"" where the head looks bigger and the length behind it looks thinner.. it's definitely a bit less noticable now tho.. I've even had one more sexual experience during this time and I was able to gain a full erection just looking at him lol... Unfortunately tho, I think he made the injury a bit worse, by doing the ""death grip"" on me.. but still, the injury doesn't seem as bad now as it did after that.

To summarize, the injury is still there. It's still affecting my overall sexual function, I would say when I'm flaccid, my penis feels disconnected from my body.. but My sex drive and arousal do seem to be returning tho.. And before anyone asks, I DID ask my parents take me to see a specialist MANY times, we even argued about it a few times but they won't do it. I think because my mom has been in and out of the hospital lately and our bills are adding up to all the money we have in our account. It's all a mess but I hope the fact that I have function means I'm not completely messed up for life..."

To start I will say I don’t always feel like I’ve been a great person - usually when I do act out though I’m joking or I’m mindless or I’m literally at my wits end and finally to a point where I’m like “well fuck that person I don’t care anymore” 

As a child I was very extrovert-introvert. I usually would push myself out of my comfort zone (or remember pushing myself) whenever the people around me would show concern with how quite or closed off and timid I was as a kid. I was born in Cincinnati, my family moved to California, then Florida, then texas. I really never struggled to make friends however until we moved to a conservative white town in north Texas - it was here I felt like I could just never say anything right that jived with any family I came across there. Everyone wanted to know what was fucked up about my family it seemed, there was nothing we could do to not be outsiders it felt. 

Generally before this situation, I also never had trouble with the opposite sex. I always had an equal amount of big and girl friends and as a child had all the same childhood bfs that lost girls have when a boy in class has a crush on them. When I moved to texas, that was when I became really good at a sport. I also felt like it was the first place where I could just be friends with boys which was alarming to me because that wasn’t really a problem for me before. 

Upon landing in Texas I felt like I did well through the 4th grade. In the fifth grade my parents told us they were getting a divorce and I tried to tel my mom I felt super adhd but other than that I felt like I only acted out on those feelings and emotions rather than actually feeling upset. I started to struggle to talk to people and ask for help or let anyone in ago it my family life because I visited a counselor at school and told her about my family situation and the advice she gave me was to go home and consol my father. My father generally was very hard on everyone in my family so in the 5th grade that was very confusing advice to me. I remember trying to force myself to like boys that I thought were cute but then thinking that I was shallow for only liking them bc they were cute. 

I had my first boyfriend in the 5th grade and I like never talked to him except for on aim - I thought he was really funny though so during that time I think our after school convos definitely helped get my mind away from my changing family life and our changing financial state as well. 

Around middle school my parents told me I would need to ask them about dating moving forward because they are nervous and I was traveling the country to compete in my sport at this point so they wanted me to focus. I remember having my first actual crush in the 7th grade that felt justified because I rally didn’t like the guy at first and then grew to like him once we became friends. I thought that’s how it was supposed to happen but he had a crush on my friend at the time so I instead just supported that I think - or at least tried to force myself too. 

In the 7th or 8th grade the kid started flirting back, we snuggled at a football gMe and I helped his family remove the fluffy things from the band kid hats since they were band boosters. He asked me to go under the bleachers with him but I wasn’t allowed to date and I thought he was going to ask me to kiss him and I just did not feel ready for that (I was 12 or 13 and also still fighting off being timid and afraid of people). I was really hurt after when the boy wouldn’t treat me like that at school. I remember it making me feel like I was in a hole or like a really dark space whenever I was confused or wondering if I even remembered the situations in which we were alone together correctly. I was a really cold matured kid so in the end I just convinced myself that the kid was being mice because he was really warm natured. 

By the 8th grade the kid would definitely flirt with me. I was generally afraid of social situations that didn’t involve my teammates so I would sometimes lean on him during these points. I remember once night at a friends house I was super uncomfortable and out my hand on his leg - he later texted me that I gave him a boner which made me super uncomfortable because I had to look up what it was but I thought it was endearing also. He was staying at a boys house down the street and I almost asked if he wanted to meet in the middle to cuddle but then I didn’t want to get I’m either of us in trouble. 

Later that year he texted me before a party at my house that I needed to ask my parents if I could date. He said if I didn’t ask he was going to ask someone else out and that he was considering asking someone else out already though he didn’t tell me it was my best friend. I remember feeling so fucking panicked to hurt another girl and also panicked to not give him the eighth answer. My mom and I were cleaning heavily and making food but she said we could try to cal my dad right before the party so he didn’t have time to think into it and say no. We didn’t get the time to call him and my mom said she would take the fall for me but I didn’t want her to because my dad was intense. The guy never even asked me or let me tell him about this situation at the party either.

That night that boy asked my best friend out and they apparently kissed in my adolescent bedroom. I remember feeling so mortified and embarrassed and just awful. To make matters worse everyone at the party had gone into my bedroom and gone through my make up that my mom had gotten me because I had interest in make up at the time. They put it on a kid and ruined part of the palette my mom had gotten me for Christmas and let me open already. (Side note: there was also a large dildo in my bathroom that my teammate and I had found and stolen in my house - we thought it was flipping hilarious it was so huge - no one at the party ever called me out for this but internally I figured lol) I finished the night out by lashing out and playing rock band to get me through. 

After my friends thought I was legit crazy I think so I showed all of them the texts from the boy. They all decided to hate him as well. I eventually felt so bad for this and tried to flip all opinions on this guy and become friends with him again. 

He was really nasty to me and would get after me for a pair of bell bottoms that I wore but wore plaid and my first article of clothing from Abercrombie (the outlet lol), my plaid converses (my first pair of converses - on sale so plaid was my only option but I really liked them). One day I was memorizing a poem in class so I highlighted each line in different colors thinking I would memorize a line a day by remember the color that went with that line - he made fun of my for this, etc. I remember thinking how hard this was because he didn’t know it but whenever he made fun of my that hard it made me feel super fucking obese but I had no justified reason for why it would conclude to that so I couldn’t tell him how bad he was hurting me. I also started dabbling with throwing up and starving myself and cutting myself so this seemed logical to me but I couldn’t tell him that without also making him feel bad because I didn’t have these issues before he and his friend started sticking gum on a specific necklace I would wear sometimes to feel pretty at school. 

I convinced myself I was falling asleep I class so I started starving myself because I felt like the food I was eating was making me tired and my gum would fall out onto that specific necklace when I did even though it didn’t happen on any other necklace. I also started cutting myself so that I would think about that when I started to dose off at school. However I never remember it happening again after that and I’m pretty sure the gum did so that’s how I realized it was someone Else adding the gum in. 

I was also just really mean back I think. I remember feeling like I had no clue why I could not control my annoyed looks at him or why I could not just look him in the face. 

While he was dating my best friend he was actually also my first kiss. I cried while he was on the way over to my house because I felt so bad but was afraid he would get so mad at me if I canceled. After I was so upset at myself that I cried and told my mother that I was going to tell my best friend. She told me that since it was his relationship, he was the one who should have been responsible for letting his girlfriend know because I didn’t want to make two friends upset at once. I’m not sure if he ever did. 

I once got the flu for two weeks that year and he would text me things along the lines of how much he missed me at school and how much he was not afraid of my germs. I don’t really remember this time correctly because I actually think I was really sick looking back on it. I had to go to the doctor a few times before I was allowed to stet living again basically.

Later in that year I looked up in the middle of algebra class and watched him finger a girl through her pants in the middle of class in the 8th grade. I thought he was looking at my whole he did it but I’m blind so I am pretty sure I just went to the bathroom and cried and convinced myself I was seeing things until my best friend in the class brought it up later. 

At the end of that semester he left a note on my binder in a pink envelope that I threw away because I was afraid of what was in it. Later that year, he also left a super sweet note in my yearbook that another girl in my class made me feel super guilty that I wasn’t fawning over it so I tried to love him again. This time he told me we had four years together at high school to date if we wanted to however I don’t know about this because he’s sense made me feel like I don’t remember anything correctly about our situation. 

We showed up at high school at the same time once to which I said it was weird and he told me he thought it was fate. I spend the summer in between 8tb grade and high school trying to convince myself there was nothing wrong with me other than my looks and then at the end of the summer realized how fucked up it was thag I had to do that in the first place and tried to just block him out. One of my favorite athletes shared the same name as him and I eventually threw away my signed post card from him because I thought it was strange that my athletic idol and he had the same name and that I would not even sporadically have the consider the kid if I got rid of my hero’s signature as well. 

High school was rough on a boy front. I really jus stopped caring, my first homecoming date cancelled on my when I told Him I wasn’t going to give him a blow job. I found a new one then proceeded to in ditch him for me neighbor that was also giving me the run around. My first date was a boy who invited me to the movies then also cancelled on me when I told him I wasn’t going to give him a blow job. I was trying to wait to try anything sexual until my period started since my family had no moral or religious convictions relation to celibacy. I really just wanted to make sure my boys was working, I also hated my home town for obvious reasons so I never wanted to get attached to anyone sexually so I could leave. I was working REALLY hard to try to be mice, be academic, and practicing for 30-35 hours outside of school I’m a sport and it felt like really unfair to me to be bullied so hard when I generally friend to make everyone feel welcomed regardless. 

That being said - I have grown to be a very angry adult [internally mostly]and I don’t want to live the rest of my life upset and mad because I know it will become external so I’m working through the next years trying to take back my physical and emotional health back and I really actually want to because I’m tired of feeling horrible about myself and also would like to actually form a healthy long term relationship with someone that I can share my life with now that I feel like I actually have done a lot of work on myself and am a good person. (This took a long time) 

To preface this - growing up I was an elite spring board and platform diving from the age of seven. I was probably a pretty bossy girl but I remember every time when someone called me out for being bossy I felt really horrible so I think I really tried to get rid of that habit by around age 10 or so. I generally always felt like I had issues these people around me would allude to but not confront me about out of fear of making me upset so I’ve spent a lot of my life trying to predict the ways in which I will make others upset before I do. This had lead to be not paying attention to a lot of my own needs I think. I’m not sure I just don’t want to feel sad or upset anymore. The way sexuality happened for me was weird because I didn’t have a period until I was 15 then not again until I was 16 then not consistently until I was 17.

The first time I ever gave a guy a blow job was a kid who was 17 when I was 15 and he knew one of my girl best friends that was on my diving team. He would come to my class everyday and try to sell me chocolate for his prom ticket fundraiser and ask me about it my friend. I invited him over to my house one night honestly thinking “wow I’m really far behind all of my friends sexually, I guess I’ll just invite a guy over and make out with him” I think I ended up giving him a blow job. I don’t remember because I was taking melatonin to sleep at the time but it was the reason I stopped taking melatonin. The reason I’m pretty sure I gave him a blow job was that he texted me that the next day. It freaked me out which is why I stopped taking melatonin. 

My first time happened on my couch when I had only had two mensutral cycles over two years. I woke up while spooning with a guy from a jarring dream and he was inside of me. This is when I gave up on myself sexually. I really haven’t valued anything about myself or my body since. My period started happening after this consistently because he was having sexual with me. I tried to break up with him three weeks into it but he told me he loved me. He would also get upset at me for wearing leggings as pants and told me when we died and went to heaven we would be brothers and sisters and we couldn’t have sex anymore at that point because we had to act like brothers and sisters. He would also tell me how he was friend with my English teacher and that his grandparents had a Hawaiian vacation saved up for a honeymoon for whomever he marries. Anytime I tried to break up with him he would go on Facebook and make a long post about how amazing I was and how much he loved me. 

He once showed me the twitter of a girl who was really rude to me in middle school and asked me about her. I said she was a bitch in middle school but that she had probably grown up or something along those lines because she was friends with one of my mutual guy friends. He ended up marrying her. 

On Valentine’s Day I was afraid he’d make me do anal and I was about to tell the kid from middle school everything about our relationship anyways because i was scared and had re read the middle school yearbook note he left me which said I could tell him if I needed help with boys. I figured it probably did not still stand from middle school anymore but I would try anyways and we had started flirting in my eyes. So I just straight up broke up with my boyfriend on Valentine’s Day. 

I continued to get closer to the middle school boy again and we ended up dating and going to prom together. It was obviously a way better experience than middle school obviously because he had grown up and I still remembered the good things I liked about him in middle school more than the scary stuff (expect for the situation that happened out my house - I still sometimes cry about that but I’ve generally disconnected him from the hurt and it just makes me sad to think about how much it changed my perspective on life and love still rather). So, I did indeed let myself fall in love too quickly this time rather but I thought he was too.

For my 18th birthday he wrote me a song and he would quote Beatles lyrics when we had sex sometimes so idk... I figured he also loved me. The song he wrote me was about how I brought love to the situation and how I was his everything so I decided to tell him I did actually love him after he sang that to me because I finally felt bad that I he never said it before.

When I to him he told me we didn’t have time to love each other anymore since I was leaving for college in a few months and I cried myself home from his house, he went on a trip and then came back and told me he did also love me but I while he was gone I trained myself to tell myself that I was never going to say it agin so all I could say was thank you and then I just told myself he knew so i didn’t need to ever say it again. 

When I left for college I frantically cried and mailed him letters that I was going to keep that I had written after every date we had been on pretty much because I thought I was going to forget everything and I had been looking forward to dating him since middle school. So I would try to recount everything and how much I loved him and then date them and then I sent them to him because I felt like I was always negative around him so I wanted him to know I was trying to go home and recount all the positive things. 

I ended up sending them because I was going to miss him and I also was afraid he was going to become depressed because he wasn’t going to college and everyone else was. So I wanted him to know he was okay and that at least someone thought the world of him if he didn’t think wel of himself for not taking a traditional path like the rest of us. 

I went to college and my period stopped. I told him after four days and he told me his brother had had similar experiences with girls and that it was never real. I got scared because I was now also considering his brothers life. So I googled all of the ways to jump start a period and did this things for the next few days until my period started (papaya, caffeine, cohosh, etc.) 

A few weeks after this I had a physical and was put on HUGE iron pills, vitamin D, a myriad of other vitamins, and birth control. This all made me super paranoid about what was actually happening to my body because i felt like I had no clue at this point. I decided to just power through this and delete all of my social media and focus my life into straightening my life out at this point instead.

I ended up having a great year academically and even met a guy that I actually ended up really liking at school. I still transferred to be closer to home and at a cheaper school at the end of the year. 

After about a year of being broken up I would still see my ex and sometimes even cheat on my boyfriend with him. We were once planning to hangout and I was about to start my period b UT had also decided I would finally tell my ex no and move on. This time he didn’t let me really say no anymore and so I had to physically get out of his car while I was giving him a blow job because I felt like I was gonna throw up on him. In my head I was telling myself it was because he was not letting me be consensual anymore and getting really mad at him but in reality I went home later that night and realized I had started my period in his car. I was so embarrassed and also have had a history of throwing up on my periods so I told myself it was that rather. 

When I confronted him about the situation and somethings he had said to me to try to get me to hook up again he told me I wasn’t remembering the situation. I did feel pretty sober but hit my head a lot growing up and was high so I’ve always assumed he was right and responded to this situation by lashing out and cutting him out because I honestly felt like I was ruining both of our lives. I was like seriously depressed and also scared of him and also wanting to jump back into another relationship so that he would just have to respect that. 

He told me he wanted to hook up with other people and that I should want to as well. I finally go the the fuck it point and hooked up with his friend that he was always wary about. That friend ended up taking pictures of my ass the best morning while I was getting dressed and sent them to people I went to school with. I was mortified and everyone consoled me by telling me I looked really good in the picture. 

After all of this I jumped into a relationship. The relationship was both so bad both ways that no feel like I will never ever be able to date again. 

I also get chronicle migraines and stomach pains and my periods have gone back to me throwing up and nearly passing out with shard shooting pain down the insides and out raises of my legs from my thighs to my knees. 

I don’t want to have to take depression medication and I want to be able To feel like I can be truthful in a relationship and also take care of someone.

Does anyone know any advice for how to approach doctors in these situations? I am aiming to see general wellness doctors over therapists first because I honestly think part of me feeling so awful is something medically that might be wrong. Thanks you in advance for any advice or encouragement.

I don’t want to lash out at my family and want to be able to be honest with my friends about my relationships and not have people constantly point out to my that I could be treated better or find a better partner in a relationship."

Almost everyday, I would be masturbating once or twice to it. My method of masturbation was dry masturbation, where I rubbed mine on pillow or bed while lying down on my stomach.

But, 2 months ago as I reached my mid 20s, I started the process to quit watching porn and stop masturbating as I am thinking about my future. Sometimes, every 2 or 3 days I watched porn to masturbate, but comparing to previous habit, it's much better, with me aiming for longer time (i.e. masturbate once in 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month).

I noticed that I might have premature ejaculation This is because when I do dry masturbation, I can only last less than a minute. I am afraid that it will affect my sexual health/performance in the future with my partner as I am looking forward to get married in several years.

So, what should I do to improve my sexual health/performance? For now, I have been doing kegel exercise everyday, but I'm not sure if I'm in the right way to improve/recover."

I first started noticing this last year with my then girlfriend at the time. Unless she was giving me head, I couldn’t/wouldn’t really stay hard. I figured I just wasn’t as attracted to her as I thought I was and moved on. The first time we had sex (unprotected) was a traumatic and unpleasant experience due to the fact that she lied about being on birth control. I also did not get tested for an STD afterwards. That whole experience really stressed me out.

As time went on, I realized I had drastically reduced sexual desire. Don’t masturbate much anymore, stopped watching or having an interest in porn, and I rarely have spontaneous erections except sometimes in the mornings.

Further, I have a new girlfriend now and we love each other very much however our sex life is completely lacking. I almost have no sexual desire with her at all and when we have Intimate moments, I usually can’t get a good erections or can’t keep one for very long. Which is starting to really hurt/affect her.

I love her, but I can’t explain what’s wrong with my body and at this point I really don’t know what’s wrong. I used to be a very sexually active/interested guy and now sex is like hardly even a thought. I don’t get turned on by sexual imagery or conversations like I used to when I was younger. My girlfriend is starting to get very discouraged of my interest in her and she thinks I’m not attracted to her at all because of it. Which definitely adds some stress on me. 

I will say that I think I abuse beer (don’t drink everyday but usually binge drink when I do. Probably once every two weeks or so for the last several years).

I’m wondering what is causing my erectile dyfunction and low libido? Could it be an STD? Beer/alcohol abuse? Anxiety (which I would say mine is probably clinical), PTSD from my last relationship? Stress? Lack of exercise? (I work an office job and don’t walk miles on a college campus every day like I did for 4 years)."

I've harassed girls and had one abusive sexual moment and in general abusive ideas normalized , i didn't know if it was abuse at that time but i´ll try to explain everything.

 I was always the quiet cool guy that took care of everybody in parties, didn't allow my friends to get molested or my drunk friends to molest anybody,but somehow i ended up doing it myself,went from trying to play the flirt to do dumb and disrespectful shit,even criminal shit , i almost always apologized after wards, most of the time I didn't woke up thinking it was cool,and really i don´t know if its ego,insecurities,trauma or a mix of everyone. i did all this at parties because i never even had a date,but i think i would've act like this,maybe not so persistent tho.

When i was 18 i locked one of my female friends into his bathroom, yes at crazy as it sounds,minutes after i danced wit my friends to get the creeps to go, i tried repeatedly to kiss her, then i followed her and i did that,locked her in with me, she just laughed, kissed me a little then left, when i realized it, i almost cried saying sorry to her and she understood, and everybody just laughed at the situation after.
 
Second when i was 20, i was kissing with a girl in a tent at a party and started to trying to touch her even after she had said no, and telling her to go somewhere else and trying to get to sex, I remember my mind was like convinced of getting  to do it, after that it calmed an we kept kissing and all, few days later a friend of mine who was the boyfriend  of a friend of this girl,told me i had put put her hand on my groin, and i realized i had already done that with other girls, 3 times, those times we were both horny and those times it had 'worked' plus it was done to me too, two girls had put my hands in her tits and groin too before,i guess i copied it or thought it wasn't that bad cause i liked it either way. i didn't think it was that bad because the girl told my friend she was still interested in me, i apologized recently to her saying i was way too persistent and that shouldn't have happened, told her i was worried because if i would've have a girlfriend i prolly would´ve been a jackass, and that i had suicidal behavior(not trynna make a victim of my self, thats absolutely true) and if i was thinking in commiting suicide and all that shit then my mind have been really fucked up, she told me I was super drunk, that she almost didnt even remebered it when she thought of past abuse experiencies and she took it as a drunk-party thing, told me the message i was sending her surprised her, that she gets im worried and all, she even told me to recover self esteem and go see a therapist.i thanked her for her kindness and his for listening to me. 

The weird thing is i had been kissing with a girl in the same party and same tent like 2 hours before, both alone and i didnt persist at all, if i tried something i just stopped when she said no, and then i ended abusing the other girl  bc thats abuse and i didnt know, at  that moment there was even  people there trying to sleep too, weird as shit, still cant figure how tf i did it. I had sexual intercoursekisses, touchin, with consent, with a girl in a tent full of people in my first party and we took it like a game that time so i might have thought i could repeat that again, I can't really tell what was in my mind. 

One month later i had been dancing with a girl in a other party and as we were really close i thought i could kiss her, then i slowly started to get far,taking her far from that place instead of asking her if he wanted to go other place (again thinking that shit could work) and i started telling her cmon cmon you arent even with your boyfriend (did'nt even really knew that) and i was not understanding no is no, trying to make it work, thats harassement too, 3 days later i apologized with her when a friend called me saying this girl talked to him saying i harassed her, then they set up a meeting at like 4 pm, she told me the problem was everyone was telling her ex that she had fucked and kissed everyone and she thought it was me, i told her i wasnt, though we kissed a little that shit shouldnt have happened, that i dont act that way sober( im so naive with girls i cant even say that is true) So thats the point, when i was drunk this CREEPY ass behavior showed up, 2 years after all this with 22 years of age i realized i abused someone and harassed other girls and i cant stop crying and puking when thinking about it, wont kill myself bc i know i would be a coward and only cause more pain but i think i wont get through it easily, plus i obviously deserve some bad times maybe. 

Now i´ll talk about what i can say trauma, and possible causes to act in a so unemphatic way.
My brother is a violent asshole who cant control anger, has violented  me verbally and phyisically since i can remember, i suffered child bullying from elementary till like 8th grade, when i was 8 yo in 3rd grade a kid broke my leg trying to make me fall, i realized after being walking with pain for a month, they made me sit with a kid that grabbed my balls all the time, everyday for a month until i was able to tell my dad the day i did the same to him and he gladly told me not to do it and allow it again,  and i could speak like 3 hours of the shit i suffered in that school that year,thats how much violence i suffered in that age and my brother did the same to me, he cooked for me and all but i don´t think you could be that mean to a kid that was going thru that much, he used to wait for my dad to leave to indtimidate me saying i was a pussy for snitching and not responding ( i was 8, he was 17, he never hit me with his fist but a lot of slaps, kicks, shoves from a 6'0 215+ lbs guy) plus our mom had passed away two years old when i was 6 , i honestly always thought it wasnt that bad to have a life like that at such a young age but most people had told me they wouldn´t be even alive in my shoes, i think  i was the perfect prospect to become a sick person. Violence continued in the past schools but after 3rd grade but at least i had friends there, my brother never changed really,always intimidating thinking he could be the way we wanted with everyone, what i want to express is i kinda never responded to violence, always kept it to me, i think it is weird for a kid to let a classmates beat him and even touch him without do nothing. 

My grandma helped my father raise us too, she´s absolutely insane, a religious fiend, preaching on the streets but she drowns cub cats in water not to raise him, she always caused trouble, she used to argue a lot with my brother,even told him the he had killed my mother, that it was his fault when it was from aneurysma, she did that with me and my sister watching, thats how crazy she is.

 Never had any consent education, cant blame my father, he was busy trying to raise us with the minimum and all by himself, we were so poor sometimes i had to go to eat to my other grandma´s place, i think i had lots of the  problems a kid could have, my dad is a dog, hes a social worker and he knows his shit,  hes a badass father and never did anything wrong to me, i always wanted to be like him.

This year i realized i talk alone too, i probably do since a young age, even on the streets ive said hi to the air, i think its not that bad, i imaginaged situations where i responded to violence and ive thought sometimes one of my friends is there, i think that helped me to unconsciusly bear through it but it shows some kind of mental problem i would guess becuase I talk to the air like imaging conversations with no one there  even if I am on the bus or at the streets, it is certainly weird. 

  Im a 22 virgin (had sex one time at 19 and i was drunk, my dick aint even got hard, plus i think im a premature ejaculator and alcohol didnt allow me to feel any sort of sensibility) i've kissed girls and touched girls only in parties, never had that much of a real life, a quiet guy, few friends, pretty normal guy and even a good guy witch makes this weirder, always protected my girlfriends from getting harassed by drunk guys and even stopped my drunk friends from doing that, . Problem is i ended up doing it myself, that creepy ass behavior showed up.

I had problems with porn too, i think i started watching it from 11 years old and got addict to it from like 13-22 and i realize i had been jerking to abuse and probably rape, either made up or rape without even knowing it was, porn is usually not harmful especially if is at a normal age but at 11 i think i´ts too much, ive been trying to let it but sometimes i end up in a binge, it´s like my mind is used to it, i dont think it could harm now but im trynna stay off it. Now that I'm older I remember I unconsciously battled perverted ideas maybe because of anxious and intrusive thoughts that made me realize things before. 

In my country they're cancelling everyone for this typa thing, harassement, violence, and raping stuff. So I realized it, when one girlfriend of my sister was cancelling his ex 'fuckmate' bc they used to do anal and she was hurting and telling to stop but dude just kept going. There i realized that shit behaviour is from porn, that I kinda  liked that too, sometimes i thought girls where saying no was hot or something like that, we all have kinks but honestly I couldn't tell if I could separate porn from reality because I don't know how fucked up mentally I was, like thinking no is yes, and i may wouldve done the same if i had had sex sometime beside my shitty first time, porn users know that shit is from porn, and me putting girls hands into my body could be a porn thing too, locking someone i dont know but yall get the point, i cant tell if i would´ve done that sober with a girlfriend really because i dont know, I could assure I would been able to realize I was causing discomfort and stop as I did the day  I committed abuse with that girl but who knows, I don't know if I had a disorder or what was in my min.

My abusive brother was caught watching porn a lot too, i remember when i was 11 he had some old school porn DVD's, and I think he has acted sexually abusive too because of what I heard from other rooms when he has sex or something, and Im pretty sure he acts like that because he often yells to his girl and to my sister and women could tell that violent boyfriends are sexually violent too most of the times , he  has beaten me and made me feel like shit since i can remember, and he probably ruined my life and he may have made me like this, all the egocentric, wiseass, insecure and abusive behavior ive had in my life is very close to his, he will be a dad in months so i would like to get him therapy but he doesn't change and we don't even talk , we had a drinks with a cousin and my best friend  like 2 months ago and he started following me and shoving me over vomit of my bf that I didn't clean completely without knowing, in a way he acted likely like me when I molested girls, he just wanted to step over me and don't teach me nothing, he yelled to me: when I speak you just shut up! And left, there I realized he just projects towards me and doesn't want to help me at all so I got tired of trying to take humiliations so he doesn't get kicked out. 

 I kinda would like to leave college, all this girls i molested are from my school, and i am in my 9/10 semester about to finish but i'll leave, these girls though they accepted the apologize they probably deserve not seeing me anymore, if sum like this happened to my sister i would love the guy to leave my sister in peace.

Environment lead to this shit too, i was harassed in parties too, got my mouth licked out of nowhere, like 20 times girls grabbed my ass out of nowhere, i was threatened from a girl, told me i wouldnt be in peace and she would return the ""damage"" after i told her that we had to stop talking bc i didnt want to start dating her, she was already controlling me and saying i was her bf and we just had seen each other once. And my female friends just laughed at these things and allowed it, and so i did. I feel its true i had the experience from a 14 y/o at 20 years old, i feel its true that i had severe trauma and i could be in jail if i had exploded and returned the damage to my brother or i couldve killed my self when as a kid or now.
I even want to start studying pshychology or be a teacher so i can save kids from this type of shit. I don't care if sometime i get exposed in social media bc i think i couldve done worst things and i had to learn the wrong way, it was bound to happen, i was a danger to women without knowing, ofc it couldve been different, in a worse or better way, im kinda thankful i rejected every woman that wanted to date me and every women that rejected me too because i dont know if i would´ve been nice or abusive, i thinks there are 2 sides to it.
I probably deserve being so repetitive, depressed, sad an disgusted about it because i acted like that ( i was depressed before too) but i think i dont deserve to have my mind full of shit since an early age, always was a good guy,though life only offered me bad things, i always said i wouldn´t cheat on a girl, and i always thought about my first time being at like 15 with the girl i loved, in a lovely and innocent way,and  here i am, sometimes i think my life is over and if i help my brother´s kid and wife im good, if i dont get to know girls and have sex idgaf, but lately i´ve woke up and started crying about it, i honestly want to give and feel all the love and good intentions i have but i think i´ts too late,  i don´t know what girls think or if i should tell about this to a girl i date in the future.
Everyone has told me im a good guy, that man usually dont even care about what they do, that for the life i had i shouldnt even be alive, or that i should go to therapy, stop drinking and thats it, but i think that behaviour is at least a thing to worry.
I'm looking for a therapist and i think i will be fine but hearing the whole thing and  a piece of advice would work a lot, thanks in advance. 

Postdata: I wrote this a few months ago when I was in a crisis, waking alone at home till 6 am mumbling to the air biting my lips and thinking I was going to get trapped  in mental illness, I am better now but still I haven't gone to therapy and I would like to hear opinions from whoever would like to do it because I don't know how fucked up my life was or how it would connect to sexual behaviour or ideas."

I would appreciate if someone could read this and give me a little piece of advice, thanks in advance",https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualhealth/comments/k6lz22/sexual_bad_behaviour_twisted_sex_view_mental/,_berserker98,1,2020-12-04 06:34:03,2,/r/sexualhealth/comments/k6lz22/sexual_bad_behaviour_twisted_sex_view_mental/,NaN,"First  i´ll address the main thing that i want to confess not to soften it before, just to go the point. I've harassed girls and had one abusive sexual moment and in general abusive ideas normalized , i didn't know if it was abuse at that time but i´ll try to explain everything.

 I was always the quiet cool guy that took care of everybody in parties, didn't allow my friends to get molested or my drunk friends to molest anybody,but somehow i ended up doing it myself,went from trying to play the flirt to do dumb and disrespectful shit,even criminal shit , i almost always apologized after wards, most of the time I didn't woke up thinking it was cool,and really i don´t know if its ego,insecurities,trauma or a mix of everyone. i did all this at parties because i never even had a date,but i think i would've act like this,maybe not so persistent tho.

When i was 18 i locked one of my female friends into his bathroom, yes at crazy as it sounds,minutes after i danced wit my friends to get the creeps to go, i tried repeatedly to kiss her, then i followed her and i did that,locked her in with me, she just laughed, kissed me a little then left, when i realized it, i almost cried saying sorry to her and she understood, and everybody just laughed at the situation after.
 
Second when i was 20, i was kissing with a girl in a tent at a party and started to trying to touch her even after she had said no, and telling her to go somewhere else and trying to get to sex, I remember my mind was like convinced of getting  to do it, after that it calmed an we kept kissing and all, few days later a friend of mine who was the boyfriend  of a friend of this girl,told me i had put put her hand on my groin, and i realized i had already done that with other girls, 3 times, those times we were both horny and those times it had 'worked' plus it was done to me too, two girls had put my hands in her tits and groin too before,i guess i copied it or thought it wasn't that bad cause i liked it either way. i didn't think it was that bad because the girl told my friend she was still interested in me, i apologized recently to her saying i was way too persistent and that shouldn't have happened, told her i was worried because if i would've have a girlfriend i prolly would´ve been a jackass, and that i had suicidal behavior(not trynna make a victim of my self, thats absolutely true) and if i was thinking in commiting suicide and all that shit then my mind have been really fucked up, she told me I was super drunk, that she almost didnt even remebered it when she thought of past abuse experiencies and she took it as a drunk-party thing, told me the message i was sending her surprised her, that she gets im worried and all, she even told me to recover self esteem and go see a therapist.i thanked her for her kindness and his for listening to me. 

The weird thing is i had been kissing with a girl in the same party and same tent like 2 hours before, both alone and i didnt persist at all, if i tried something i just stopped when she said no, and then i ended abusing the other girl  bc thats abuse and i didnt know, at  that moment there was even  people there trying to sleep too, weird as shit, still cant figure how tf i did it.

So to explain a bit, I’m male in my 30s and for a while now I have had a huge decrease in my sex drive, nearly no libido and when I do have sex it’s sometimes hard to remain... hard. The thing is that I believe it’s more a mental problem, thus all started when I lost my job (years ago) it was the first time I ever got fired. I get very horny in the middle of the night when half asleep and don’t realize what’s going on. Anyway I want to fix this, but where do I start? Do I go see a doctor, a specialist, a therapist? Do I got to a clinic, private practice? I’m pretty lost.

I asked him to get a condom or no sex and he said to give him a blow job instead since he didn’t have a condom. So I asked him where were his test results since I’ve showed him my own results (negative hiv, negative std) that I literally got back a week ago. He told me he’s healthy &amp; that why does it matter. The fact that he can say something like that is so disgusting and he’s not the first man that has been unwilling to show results. I don’t understand how some people like him can treat sexual health as if nothing can go wrong. It’s easy to say “I’m healthy and I’m clean” but when it comes down to showing proof grown ass people actually make any excuse as to why they can’t show a simple test result. My favorite is when a guy tells me “oh I’m going to get checked this week!” Like just get checked. I’ve even had men get upset at me because I refused to do anything sexual with them if they don’t prove negative results. It’s also scary how some men use the line “oh I’m gonna get you pregnant one day” but those SAME guys are the ones hesitant to take a test or show results. Like who are you going to get pregnant...not me lol. Idk how anyone even women too can just have sex with someone so willingly and easily and on to the next person without thinking of sexual consequences."
