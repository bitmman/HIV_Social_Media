1uihhr,A guy I've been seeing got mad when I didn't want to go any further when he said he is HIV positive.

I really liked him on the first date, and I actually had a meeting in the morning and we didn't meet up. Our second date was a hike, and we were legitimately to tired to fool around. Our third date we kissed a little, but he said we couldn't go to his place and mine was filled with people from my roommates party.

So its the fourth date. I'm really liking this guy; he's funny, smart and kind. We go back to my place and go straight to the bedroom. Making out passionately, like I never had before. It's getting really hot, and he goes down on me. After a bit I want to do the same. I realize I hadn't gone through the cursory ""Are you neg"" thing. So I say I am, and he says to me ""I'm positive, undetectable."" I must have given him a look of shock because he very calmly says ""I guess you'll want to talk about it."" He talks about how he caught it a decade ago when he was newly out and not very cautious. I say I would have expected him to tell me before we started. He apologized and said that is a valid point. But then he said on our first date I said I assume everyone I sleep with is positive (maybe I did, I can't remember but that is my policy). Then we go on talking, and I say it's just different for me when I know someone is positive. He said I have probably slept with someone who has HIV in the past and didn't know it, but it is still a mental impasse for me. I said I wanted to think on it. He left, really frustrated but understanding.

Was I mean? This guy is so nice, probably my ideal man if I'm honest. But it is hard to imagine myself in a relationship where I can't ever let my guard down in sex. My parents had such a fear of me getting AIDS when I came out, and I think they instilled that in me. "

My roomate went on PrEP about 3 months ago and has essentially been a cum dump since.  Every day he has at least one guy coming over to breed him... Sometimes several.   I don't care that he's going through a phase but he and I are friends and I do want him to not face permanent damage.

He said that because he's on PrEP he CANT get HIV or GIVE HIV to someone.  My concern is the that the second or third guy In a day is coming into a pretty toxic hole at that point as lets face it if he's getting guys who are into the BB scene there will be some poz guys In that mix.   So, can a neg top guy get HIV from having sex with someone bottoming who is carrying a toxic load in them? And how accurate is he when he says he CAN'T get HIV?  As a side note In the last month he has tested positive for just about everything else but HIV.

Edit: wow, thanks everyone , you have given me a lot of ammunition for a heart to heart later today.  I really appreciate it everyone!"

I'm hoping that someonout there can help me/offer some advice, as I've been going out of my mind, I'm a bag of nerves.

I've started seeing a guy who I met on tinder, and we've been going out for about a month and a half now. The other night he told me tested positive for HIV last year after being attacked and raped in Colombia.

We've not had sex or anything like that, but obviously there is now a massive roadblock in our relationship, when it had been going so well.  I really like this guy.

I'm wondering if anyone here has any advice on what I should do, if there's anyway I can continue being in this relationship whilst being safe, and 99.99999999999999% risk free or if I should cut and run.

I read something about a pill that stops the virus taking hold if there is an ""breach of security"" so to speak?  Is that an actual option, is it 100% effective?

I'm live in the UK if that has any relevance to health care/risk prevention etc etc?

Thanks guys, kisses.

I went out with a wonderful guy, smart, talented, great looking. A real prince charming. We had a magical date on a roof top wine bar in Laguna beach and watched the sunset. We went down to the beach and smoked a joint, had an amazing time together. He sit up on the cliff and look out the stars and we kiss. Magic.

We go thru the awkward questions. Preferences ect. Finally he admits to me his HIV status. I hug and him give him a kiss on the cheek. I first ask him his viral load and if he's on medication. He tells me he doesn't know and isn't yet as he has been healthy.. I tell him I need to be sober before I can properly tell him what I think of it all. We continued to have an awesome evening.

Today I am feeling pretty down. I know enough not to be afraid that we made out. I did tell him I would hang out again, I just need to do some research and prepare myself mentally. 

Bros, especially who have dealt with HIV, what questions do I need to ask, and what should be my next steps...? I literally took an OraQuick test the night before the date and it came back negative for me.

Guys, I feel horrible. I have a prince charming who just wants me to keep talking to him, and part of me is petrified. Can I be intimate with someone that every time I do something with them I have to worry I am taking a risk to my own health? Do I emotionally invest in someone that I may not be able to have kids and grow old with? 

I'm feeling really lost. And I care a lot. I don't know what to do."

I know that I was at risk but that I could worry about that after getting tested.

I rushed to the clinic to get myself tested and learned I was HIV-, and let him know that I was okay so he didn't need to worry about having transmitted it to me. It's been about three months since we last had sex, so I'm pretty confident in the result as well.

So what do I do now? My only experience talking to people with traumatic news is when my mother was diagnosed with cancer.  I guess my first thought is to try to help him re-establish normalcy. I  already said we can watch Game of Thrones together like we normally do this Sunday and I'd bring the beer as it's my turn.

How at risk am I?  Every cough and sore throat I am nervous that I will test postive for HIV, and I am a nervous wreck.

I guess I am looking for comfort as well as facts.  I am going to get tested soon, but with work conflicting with clinic hours it makes it difficult to find time to go.  I have not been sexually active since, and I don't plan on having sex for a while just in case. 

Also, how many tests until I should be ok to have protected sex?  I am in a monogamous relationship and this is putting a strain on my relationship.  He's great and supportive, I just feel guilty because I don't want him to be at risk, too.

So being the paranoid person that I am, I had a quick question about HIV transmission. I hooked up with a guy the other day and don't know his status, and no penetration happened. However, I accidentally sat in his jizz for a brief about of time (maybe about 30 seconds-1 minute?) and some of it might have made contact with my anus. I showered about 5 minutes later and everything, but I was wondering what the risks were. I understand that penetration causes tears in the anus which are the main method of transmission, but from what I understand (Which admittedly might not be as much as it should be) there's also a lot of mucus membranes that could potentially transmit HIV. 

So basically, what are my risks?"

25 year old male here, just graduated from grad school. Like a lot of people I have anxiety about getting tested... my situation is weird though, and I guess I'd like some input.

I hooked up with three people my junior year of my undergrad a little over three years ago - just people I had met on A4A - but only had oral sex with them (without a condom), never anything else. They were all clean-cut guys who were very clean and had no visible sores/symptoms of anything, so I just went with it. Nobody swallowed any fluids either so I just kinda put it in the back of my mind.

For one reason or another I never made plans to get tested after those hookups happened. Stupid, I know. I always just said ""well, I'm not showing symptoms, so why bother with having to deal with insurance and whatnot"" (also stupid). 

But now it's been a few years since it's happened, and I haven't had sex since them (no suitable buddies + tons of work in grad school = no time to have sex). I also have never had ANY symptoms of an STD - after reading a bit, it sounds like a lot of diseases can present no symptoms for a good amount of time afterwards, but will eventually start to produce symptoms, and I have never exhibited any. 

Is it probable that, after 3 years, no sex since then, and no symptoms that I could still have an STD (gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, etc) and not know it?

Thanks guys

Poz bros, can anyone tell me if Ryan White coverage is a nation wide thing once you have it? 

My bf is poz and we are moving to western Oklahoma. That presents all kinds of challenges as a serodiscordant gay couple, but the one we are most worried about is continued coverage for his Complera through the RWA. It's about $3000/month, and thankfully we pay nothing right now between insurance and RWA. We can't afford for that to change. 

Has anyone moved to another state while receiving Ryan White? Did you need to change anything or did coverage continue?

Also, anyone know of a good HIV doc in OKC or surrounding areas? The doc he has now oversees several others and their primary focus is HIV/AIDS. I'm not real comfortable with a regular family physician who's never dealt with HIV taking over.

However its sort of a half-baked line of thought. There must be very few gay men using condoms or dental dams for oral sex, so it seems to me, that the main reason why condoms are there is because they stop HIV and as added benefit they may stop something else contracted through anal sex.

Now do the mental exercise of living in a world that HIV did not exist and had not existed.

the title of this chart is **Estimated Per-Act Probability of Acquiring HIV from an Infected Source, by Exposure Act**

So lets say **if I'm a top, and I have a bareback sex with a HIV possitive bottom, the odds of me getting HIV is 11 out of 10,000?** Or is it a condomed sex? the article also stats that *consistent use of condoms reduces the risk of getting or transmitting HIV by about 80%* ; **if** the 11/10000 is the odds of getting HIV via condomed sex, the odds of getting HIV via bareback sex is 55/10000.

So about a month ago I had unprotected receptive anal sex with a random guy that drugged me at a club. The past two days I've run a fever and have had intermittent headaches. I'm very worried it might be a seroconversion illness. 

I've been desperate to go get tested for HIV but having studied it in depth (as a biomedicine student) I know that any test available to me in Australia before 4 weeks isn't going to be all that conclusive anyways. I'm going to get tested on Monday but have found myself experiencing extreme anxiety (which is only compounding my fever and headaches) and there really isn't any time earlier I can get tested (which I would). 

I know all about safe sex, I know the relative risks of transmission, I know the prognosis and treatment options for HIV+ patients; I just can't get over the anxiety, stress and worry I'm experiencing. I can't sleep, can't eat anything, have been excersing compulsively to try to destress (which is not helping my fever) but nothing has worked. 

As a 20 year old who has only just recently come out, I feel that a positive diagnosis would just completely and utterly destroy my life. Not to mention I'd have to tell people how I got the disease. I'm ashamed and embarrassed that I allowed myself to be put into a situation where I could be forced to have sex. I'm embarrassed that I wasn't able to fight him off. I'm angry at myself for not seeking post-exposure prophylaxis as soon as I arrived home (I was abroad in the US at the time). I'm worried how I'm gonna tell my (recent) boyfriend if I do test positive. Im furious at the guy who drugged me (if I ever see him again I'll bash the living shit out of him, HIV+ or not). I'm worried that my regular friends will judge me as being slutty or stupid or unclean (we've all been educated properly about safe sex and the need for condom use). I don't know how I'd deal dating as an HIV+ man. Basically I'm worried that my life is now over because I decided one last night out in Vegas was a good idea. 

Right now, I need some strategies to deal with the anxiety I'm feeling and hearing some stories about other guys who've gone through similar experiences would be comfortin. I hear that HIV scares are common among gay men :/. 

Just realised that this is quite the long post :/ I put a tl;dr at the top but I appreciate everyone who took the time to read all the way through. I also wanted to point out that this post is in no way meant to shame or degrade those who are HIV+; hell it's possible that I'm HIV positive too.

**EDIT:** Thanks everyone for the advice and perspective. I'm still feeling quite anxious, but I'm gonna try meditation and distraction techniques to keep me occupied. In the meantime, I'm gonna capitalise on the fact that I'm actually somewhat tired for the first time in 2-3 days and attempt some sleep. "

A few days later I asked him on whatsapp about the no-condom thing (because I'd really like to have anal with him) and he revealed that he's HIV+, but taking meds and his viral load is undetectable. That's the first time I met someone HIV+ (or at least that I knew was HIV+). Knowing this, I am not afraid and still want to have fun with him.

* He mostly bottoms. He doesn't want to use condoms because it's painful for him because of friction. This is something we'd have to solve if we ever want to have anal. I don't know what options are available on that side. Other kinds of condoms ?  
* I need to know a bit more about HIV. Because while I can roughly imagine what ""undetectable load"" means, I don't really know in practice what to do with that information. Wikipedia won't help me this time because it's not really a practical guide :p
* In general I'm not 100% sure how cautious I should be about all this. As I said, I don't bareback, but I don't use condoms for oral either. Should I consider that now ? 

TL;DR : what are options for a guy who cannot use standard condoms ? Where can I find good, practical info on HIV ? How should I act with my HIV+-treated-undetectable sex buddy ?

I am so filled with confusing emotions, somebody help me out here please.",http://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2fj3ju/my_fwb_just_told_me_he_is_hiv_positive_i_am_so/,[deleted],23,9/4/2014 23:39,21,/r/askgaybros/comments/2fj3ju/my_fwb_just_told_me_he_is_hiv_positive_i_am_so/,NaN,"I'll premise this by saying I've been tested and am negative. That's not what is giving me anxiety. 

So this guy and I have been really close for the past 2 years. At first I guess we were sort of going steady but then I told him I wanted to just be friends with benefits in an open relationship which he was fine with. Anyway I became good friends with him and I feel like he relies on me a bit for that friendship, as neither of us know many other people we can call good friends in this town. 

Today I came to pick him up and he told me by surprise he was positive, and we went and bought me a home test kit which I used and tested negative, and it gave me peace of mind (I'm going to make an appt for a real [blood] test soon to be sure). We both were relieved I was negative but I acted calm about it and made it a priority to comfort him and let him know I'd be there if he needs someone to talk to.

He seems to have already accepted it very well, but for some reason I'm having trouble accepting that he has HIV. Something about somebody so close to me getting it really freaks me out, is giving me panic attacks even to think about. And I don't just worry about his health (if he follows his treatment he can live to 80) -- I worry about the stigma he'll face. I mean the thought of him living a lonely sad life really bothers me deeply. It's like I'm grieving *for him* through myself. And it's really bothering me.

There are 2 problems I have with this situation:

(1) It's just that he's such a nice guy and doesn't deserve something that is going to make people think he is somehow less valuable. And when I think of the way he just accepts it so bravely, and all alone with nobody to talk to about it -- I would never be able to face it like that -- it just really seems unfair. Like, I feel so bad for him, but am trying to keep it lighthearted around him. I mean he will even joke about it which blows my mind. I don't know how I am going to deal with this emotionally being his friend, let alone how he is dealing with it. And it's not even my disease! I don't get it.

(2)Also I want to be there for him and hang out with him all the time but at the same time our relationship is sort of built on sex, and I've suffered in the past from horrible HIV anxiety, and I'm afraid any sexual contact with him would just set me off every time. I can definitely still be his friend, but then it's obvious I'm avoiding having sex with him, making him feel like he is ""damaged goods"". I don't want him to feel that way but to be honest, before I found out about him today I was going to start distancing myself and finding new dates anyway, looking for a new relationship. I had already decided weeks ago it was about time to move on soon. Then this news comes along and I feel like if I stopped talking to him now I'd make him feel shitty. And part of me wants to support him emotionally if he wants that. I know if I got HIV and lost all my friends afterword I would probably feel very lonely and depressed. I can't stand to think about my friend feeling this way. I want him to meet somebody nice and be happy forever. And I had wanted to distance myself but don't want to be the asshole friend that leaves him flat after something awful like that :c

Oh what to do? Anyone else faced a similar situation?


edit: thanks all. I just needed some people to weigh in on this matter. I know it seems insensitive and judgemental of me to be more freaked out about his diagnosis than he is, but I just needed some time to accept it. I still am suffering from anxiety about possible infection but that will end once I go get blood tested this week. And I have told my friend that we unfortunately have to stop all sexual contact because I can't deal with the anxiety. I said sorry but it was totally fine with him. We are still going to be friends and I am going to deal with it personally and try and keep from letting his status bother me in any way.

edit2: im deleting this because i dont want this information tied to me publicly any more. hopefully this post helped someone else."

After all of this, he tells me he's HIV+, undetectable, but positive... I remained calm and said okay (it still is very selfish to not disclose his status and very stupid of me not to ask beforehand) but I've always worn a condom so I didn't think, so after this I was in shock and I didn't ask all the right questions. I am fairly informed of HIV, and the highest risk of infection was ruled out with me wearing a condom, but the anxiety comes and goes, should I really be worried about the oral sex? 



Edit. THANK YOU ALL, so very much, I am much, much calmer now, I talked to him about his status and situation, and I've decided that if I do continue this relationship with this guy, we won't be having sex until he's back on his treatment and he gets new results that prove he's undetectable and his retrovirals are at the lowest; and of course I'll find a clinic that can provide me PrEP on a regular basis, all of this as an addition to always wearing a rubber. Thank you all, educating yourself truly makes it a lot easier to handle this kind of situations. All of this if he agrees, if not then he can find someone else who agrees with his practices.

Edit 2. FUCK THIS GUY. I went to the clinic and the doctor said I have nothing to worry about, I was completely safe and always have been, I just need to be extra careful when it comes to oral hygiene and oral sex. Also, I discussed this with one of my closest friends and he said it might be a possibility that this ASS made all of this up just to get rid of me, given that he hasn't said a word since the hookup and from what he told me, he seems to have no idea what he's talking about when it comes to HIV (I didn't mention that he said he had been told oral wasn't risky at all and it was all taboo) but I didn't noticed all this could be mumbo-jumbo until after I did the research and read all of your well informed replies, awesome guys in the internet...

3 weeks ago I got a positive Elisa test result. 
Then I got a negative Western blot. 
Almost a week after that I got a negative p24 antigen test. 

I was told I was most likely negative but to repeat the western blot to be sure in 3 weeks. So I did. 

It came back today indeterminate.

Where does that leave me?? 

In the intervening time I've still had this virus, going on 6 weeks now with week 3 being the acute period where I was bed ridden. 

My doctor ran heaps of bloods and it came back postage for low grade hepatitis. I'm immune to b so we're waiting on second day tests to determine a or c. 

So there's definitely something going on. 

Could hepatitis be screwing with the Western blot? Or should I start preparing myself for a positive result, and assume this is the window period? Should I get a follow up p24 antigen done? 

The infectious diseases clinic rang after the Elisa and said they would have done a full viral load test but for the p24 coming back negative, they even decided I was now low risk and probably a false postive. 

How does this new indeterminate change things? 

Man I'm so I've this and need some advice :(

The different thing is that I am having a dry lower lip (due to winter weather &amp; indoor heat).

Another problem is I have general worries about HIV a lot. I mean, I never do anal, and usually don't suck to cum. But I am like crazily worried about 1~2 days after the act. Googling (usually seeing conflicting info both from reputable sources) and overthinking. The reason is I am from East Asia and currently living in the US; I am planning to get either US or an EU country's green card or citizenship in the future (actually I may be going to Europe later this year for work-related reasons). If I get HIV the immigration process would be very difficult and back in my home country the treatment is hard to come by. Again, googling yields conflicting information or information from 2004. How should I adjust my psychology so that I can enjoy my sex life without too much worries? Would PrEP work (heard that it may adversely affect liver/kidney)?

I guess the most important thing here is that I have never had anal sex still. But anyways. Like I said, I've been with three guys since then. 

One we made out and gave oral, the next we kissed there times lightly, he gave me a blow job for a few seconds and we thrusted naked against each other but there was no anal contact, I don't think. Definitely no penetration on either of us. I guess that part worries me. We also jerked off for a few minutes. And he kind of fingered me. Finally, with the last guy, we just made out, cuddled, and jerked off briefly. I didn't mean for it to be weird describing all that, but I guess those are important details. 

The first one I'm nearly 100% is negative, the second one was negative as of late November and said he wasn't with anyone but me, and the last one is 100% negative. Now, Last Tuesday, 3 &amp; 1/2 weeks after the second guy and like 2 weeks after the 3rd, I woke up a little sick. I felt weak, my head hurt a bit and my joints were a little sore. And in class I felt slightly nauseous, but the nauseous part went away pretty quickly. This may be due to the fact that I went to bed at 3:30 the previous Saturday and Sunday, and I don't handle late night well. So I went to bed at 10:30 that night and woke up with almost zero headache and my body was in much less pain. However that morning I had a very sore throat and I guess I still didn't feel perfect. I also got night sweats one night during Wednesday. Now Friday has just passed, and everything is gone but an extremely mild sore throat and soreness at the bottom of my mouth near the back of my tongue. I'm still freaked out. I mean, anal alone has a 1.4% chance of infection and oral or kissing is close to zero, so I don't know if I should be worried. 

I guess the real point of this is two things. One, if it could be a common sickness, which I think it probably is? And two, to see if anyone else had a similar experience and it turned out fine! I just need some comfort, I guess.

Please help me here, I think/know this is an utterly unsafe practice. However I cannot easily find a credible resource that states the risk of this particular practice explicitly. Most state the higher HIV risk in homosexual male sex broadly.

To clarify: he believes it is only if you are analy penetrated by an HIV+ man, that you are at risk. Whereas he himself as HIV-, is at no risk penetrating whomever anally. This is notwithstanding that South Africa has amongst the highest AIDS rates!

Any links explicitly addressing all the differing manners, in specific detail, that HIV can be transmitted in male homosexual sex is most appreciated. I am very thankful for this forum as a goto resource.

So like the title suggests, I have a question about HIV infection. Now this might seem paranoid, but I hope you bear with it and give me some advise.
I am in a 10+ year relationship and have never had sex with anyone else other than my partner. That change about a week ago. I met up with this guy, and at first I insisted that there will be no penetration, no BJs. We talked a bit before beginning and the HIV talk somehow got picked up. He told me some stories about the behaviour of his friends endangering themselves with unsafe sex and he is quite against it. He also has check ups every 3 months and his doctor is good. I have a feeling he can be trusted.

During sex, we kissed, there were blow jobs and in the heat of the moment he began rubbing his dick against my ass and very briefly stuck his penis head in my hole, but really just the tip. So I told him to stop, which he did immediately and we finished off ""conventionally"" with our hands.

So I know the basics of contracting HIV. As in you cant get it via kissing and we were not visibly wounded. The ""penetration"" was sorta non-existant and I realised he did not have any precum. Logically I believe I am just being extremely paranoid but what are the chances really of catching anything like this? I will be going for a test in 2 weeks, but before that, I am semi-worried. Would be thankful for any insight."

I mean, the highest part of me not doing that is because I would only ever consider it with a long term partner.  Even in those cases I still use condoms regularly. 

However I feel a little bit judgemental as well.  Because I know nothing much about HIV.  So it makes me panic.  

In this case it's not a big deal because for other reasons I may just tell him that I'm not interested (even though I respect him for being truthful about his status).

I would rather be able to work through things with the person instead of just reacting in fear.

I got home a bit ago and remembered to look it up and it turns out it's medicine to treat HIV.

I don't even know where to begin. Bottom line is that I have been sleeping with this guy for the last eight months and we bareback all the time. I also ejaculate inside of him.

Hey /r/askgaybros. I'm basically in a coming out process now and things are going fast! I'm looking forward to finding someone ASAP. I would probably be interested in something serious but I'm not ruling out some ""innocent"" play, since I'm really looking forward to trying something sexual with a guy.

However, I have a huge problem. I've always been a big germophobiac. And STDs, mainly HIV are a very very big deal to me. I've been thinking about it a lot lately, like what would happen if I were to contract HIV, I always start picturing how my life would be like, if I could live with it and it always ends with me picturing myself commiting suicide and nearly in tears.

Pathetic, I know, but I need to overcome this fear somehow. I've recently studied up about HIV. The fact that there is a non-zero chance even with french kissing (because of some micro-bruises in your mouth) terrifies me to no end. I also would really like how oral sex feels like (in either position), but that's also risky (and I would probably have to use a condom, which sounds weird for a BJ).

If I were to find someone I clicked with, I would probably have to bring them to test before we do something, but I really don't want to look like I don't trust the guy. Plus, there would probably be some kissing beforehand and how much of a fucking nutcase would I look like if I asked him to go get tested before we kissed?! Plus some random hookup will probably go find someone else before going to a test for my paranoid ass.

I want to pursue something but there's this constant fear, this ""non-zero chance"" and it's been eating me from inside lately. Any of you bros were in a similiar situation? Any advice?

Many of you pointed out that it was problematic that he waited until I explicitly asked (and in a compromising position) and I didn't really think much of it, but you guys made a really good point. In any case, I decided to go to a clinic, got tested for all STDs and told the doctor about the situation (which was really hard for me to be honest). We're still together and we bang (but safely!).

That's great and all, but then this one time we were laying in bed together cuddling and talking then we start talking about exes and he nonchalantly says that he still sees his. This is a full grown man, so I'm not going to pretend that he has never known a guy before me. Turns out he was with this guy since basically before I was born and they were together for 16 years, apart for 2. But they hung out two days ago, he says that he's very close to his ex's family and he even still goes to birthday parties and plans to use a family member's cottage. Clearly it was an amicable separation (they were/are married, I actually just realized as I'm writing this that I don't even know if they're divorced) and *it was* 2 years ago, but it made me uncomfortable. They split based around a lot of straining factors (disease (kind of), different goals, wanting to try other people and things) so he assures me that it's over for real.

Am I right to be uncomfortable? It also made me **excessively** sad because it made me realize that I'm just this thing on the side (then spiraled into a depression that I'll always be somebody's on the side and now I'm here). Clearly he's still affected by his ex and he's dating a university kid; he really only wants sex. You don't get with a university kid for their emotional maturity, let's be honest now. I don't understand what I can get out of this. He's very gentleman like and he actually responds to me when I speak without looking at a phone or changing topics abruptly (yes, those are the standards) so I'm happy to be with him. I feel dirty and kind of like a whore and it really feels like I'm just sleeping with him until he figures his shit out. This isn't to sound like a victim, I enjoy the sex and he's good in bed. 

The other part of this is I don't know what else is he keeping from me. I don't know if I should trust him or if it's worth it. It seems like he's progressively more interested in dating me, but is this a good idea? Is it normal for partners to keep this much in touch after they dated for so many years or should I be worried?

**TL;DR** Met a guy who didn't straight up tell me his HIV+ status, but I empathized with how he must have felt cornered and stigmatized. Now he nonchalantly tells me that he's keeping in touch with his 16 year ex and I don't know if I should freak out. Is it normal for partners to keep in touch after a 16 year relationship? Is this guy to be trusted?

My friend is thinking of meeting this guy in person for this time, and driving a few hours away to meet him. There's nothing wrong with that in my eyes and I support him.

What I need advice is on something he told me tonight. My friend told me that this guy is HIV+. He's done his research about having sex with someone who has HIV and is intelligent and wouldn't do anything that would put him at risk.

But I'm so unfamiliar with it that I just want to make sure that I don't say the wrong thing. I told him that if he's really into this guy that having HIV shouldn't be a dealbreaker (because this guy has apparently been undetectable for years). I made a stupid joke which I regret, which is why I want to make sure I say the right things so I don't accidentally fuck things up.

Thoughts? Advice? Thanks!!"

I recently starting seeing a guy at my university; I'm a 22 y/o senior, he's a 22 y/o first-year masters student.  We've been on a few dates, and I'm looking to seriously pursue a relationship.  Tonight, he told me that he was HIV+, and he's currently being medicated for it.  I'm HIV-, I want to try to make things work with this guy, but obviously there are things that I need to keep in mind to make sure it's a healthy relationship for both of us.  I started my own research, but there's a lot of information out there, and not all of it is easy to process.  I've got a few thoughts and some questions, and I'd really love some feedback to make sure my facts are straight, as well as some advice for my questions.

What I know:

* He's actively taking medicine for it, although I don't know yet if he's ""undetectable"" or not.

* Condoms are a must whenever I bottom during anal sex.

* Since I have first aid training, be cautious if I need to treat any of his bleeding wounds.

* Blood, semen, and pre-cum are the things I need to be concerned about being in contact with.  The rest of his body, including saliva and tears, I don't need to worry about.

* PrEP is something I need to look into.


Questions:

* Am I correct in assuming that condoms should also be used any time I'm topping during anal sex?  Assuming this becomes a monogamous relationship; obviously, use them in a non-monogamous relationship.

* What is the risk of contracting HIV from oral sex, both receiving and giving?

* What exactly is an ""undetectable load,"" and how is it determined? Is it something that we should re-address on a regular basis, or is it consistent after it's been diagnosed as ""undetectable?""

* What is the best way of looking into PrEP, as someone without a primary care physician, and how expensive is it for an American college student who is still on parent's insurance?

* If things go well and a relationship develops, what can I do to be a strong support pillar?  Even if things don't develop, what can I do to be a support for people with HIV in general?


Feel free to chip in any additional information that you think would be pertinent.  I don't have a whole lot of knowledge yet, and I would gladly welcome anything that would be good to know.  Many thanks in advance!

I was unable to find a job in my university town after moving for an entire summer, I tried to shake off feelings for a friend I was previously into after she kissed me on New Years in January 2014. In November 2014 on my 21st Birthday I joined tinder traded some pics, flirted a bit but nothing serious. I met this guy we flirt a bit and then we end up talking about sex. Considering I have been single for almost 10 years now and I've had no sexual experience with anyone of either sex and my general inept social skills and general low self esteem , my body confidence as I look fat and hairy being 5ft 5 and 158lbs as well as general sadness over my mothers cancer diagnosis. I very rarely drink, I don't take recreational drugs legal and illegal apart from caffeine which is usually rare and I consider myself as being self-controlled and rational.

He sent me the results of his last tests that were all clear seemed legitimate and I stayed at his house where he barebacked me as well as exchanging blow jobs as well as being anally licked. After reading /r/askgaybros on these whilst he slept I began to see how stupid I was, so I made my excuses and left at around 8pm the following night. In the morning I went to my local clinic as I was home from university and sought PEP and completed PEP in late January. During that time I tested negative for syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea as well as herpes. Assumingly I was HIV negative. During that time I neglected my university work, excessively slept both overate and underate going most days without food, neglecting my looks and generally just losing interest in the things I loved. It's been three months since and today I tested negative today on a rapid Generation 3 HIV test at my local sexual health clinic. Took 60 seconds to get my results with 99% accuracy. I've had extra blood taken as a confirmatory test which should take 7-10 days. Those seconds felt like small knives stabbing into every fibre of my being. Despite being extremely relieved I believe I may need counselling for depression and/or anxiety as a result of how low I felt during this experience. I've had a blood test for syphilis, HIV and for my HEP B vaccine (which I've already had) where I should get the results in 7-10 days. 

Quick TL:DR I barebacked bottomed first time having sex. 21 years old Bisexual, mom's got cancer and parents don't know I'm Bi. HIV negative result from a rapid third generation test in 60 seconds. Have had another confirmatory test from a blood sample and will get the results from that in 7-10 days. May need counseling from this experience. Really my question is where do I go from here? "

Now I feel a bit guilty about teasing him for not drinking whenever we go out and always eating ""healthy foods only"" as opossed to snack foods, etc. If I'd known the situation prior, I would've definitely been way less insensitive. So now I'm just wondering how exactly I can be a good friend to him now that I know? Should I cut back on inviting him to more physically taxing things such as hiking trips, gym, etc.? What kind of foods should I recommend we grab for lunch? (and which ones shouldn't I?) How emotionally sensitive should I be? What topics should I avoid and which ones should I pursue? How should I approach the topic of HIV itself, or should I just avoid it altogether?

I've come to realize just how new this is for me. Looking forward to reading your responses. Thanks in advance!

EDIT: Thanks everyone for all of the excellent responses! And to those who took the question negatively, I honestly didn't at all mean to offend with my lack of knowledge on the topic, and I apologize if I did. Though I believe I did make my ignorance on the subject quite clear (hence my whole reason for asking the question to begin with ;)

I'm aware that HIV treatments aren't as archaic as they used to be, what with all of the advancements that have happened in medicine and that individuals living with the condition can live long, happy and healthy lives. I wasn't at all implying that the disease would make my friend automatically sickly and bedridden. I will say that he does complain about severe headaches from time to time and it's at those times that I'm at a loss as to how I can help him (if at all). I see now that the best thing I can do is to properly educate myself on the illness and all of the factors and variables that accompany it. Besides that, as several of you mentioned, just continue to be a friend to him and not to treat him any differently because of it. I already told him that I love him like a little brother and that I'll always be there for him no matter what and if he ever needs anything to let me know.

I was just curious as to what are some of your's (or someone you know who is HIV+)'s bodily reactions and symptoms when they got infected. 

Of course protecting yourself and getting tested regularly is a given, but recognizing the symptoms early on and being aware could save someone's life.

Part of this mistrust comes probably from the fact that one of my only gay relationships was with a guy who turned out to be HIV positive in the end, from sleeping around. I am negative because were not risky but it just left a sort of emotional scar there, making me worried that the disease is everywhere, in everyone I could meet. I just never thought it would ever affect my life like it did, and it freaks me out. Now if I feel restricted in that I'm afraid even to hook up safely with people for irrational fear of disease.

I asked him to use a condom from the beginning and *watched him put it on*, so I thought I was in the clear. But at some point during the process, he removed it and I didn't notice until almost the very end. I expressed my concern (""Uhh, that makes me pretty nervous, you can't just use the condom?"") and he said he couldn't cum with one on, and that he was 100% clean and tested. At the very least, I asked him to finish outside of me, which he kinda did. But when I got home and started cleaning up, I noticed 2 horrifying things: 

1. He actually did cum in me a little bit and did not pull out early enough

2. The sex was so rough that there were tiny little droplets of blood on the tissue paper when I wiped.

So I messaged him back on Grindr and said ""Hey, are you absolutely sure you're clean? That made me really nervous back there."" and he replied the same way ""Yeah bro, 100% clean. I just got tested when I broke up with my bf a few months ago, and I don't do this very much.""

So now I'm contemplating going to the ER and asking for PEP. I feel like my life isn't in my own hands anymore and I can't know about my status for at least 3 more months.

I'm interested in using the OraQuick In-Home HIV test. There's a possibility I may have been exposed about a month ago (however, I'm about 95% sure no exposure occurred but still want to test). The OraQuick site says not to use the test until 3 months after an exposure. From what I understand, there is virtually no chance of a false positive with the test, but some risk of a false negative (about 8%). My question is: will the results after one month be at all reliable? In other words, is the risk of false negative after one month significantly greater than 8%, or only slightly? If OraQuick is not a good option after one month, what are some other options that can be done in-home?

I'm 22, he is 26. We attempted sex, though this was my first time (with any sex). I only decided to hook up with him because I did not want to remain a virgin when I graduated college in a month.

Neither of us were able to cum. Both of us tried anal sex (with a condom), but neither of us could stay hard enough to insert. We did have unprotected oral sex, both of us as receptive partners, but neither of us were able to cum. I did see a very small amount of clear precum on his penis when I blew him, but that was all. He did give me a rimjob and he stuck some fingers in my anus. We also french kissed. But as none of this was particularly pleasurable to me, I ended the session after 15 or 20 minutes, and he went home.

He says that he is clean and that he just had a negative HIV test done on April 8, 2015. He had a clean STI test done back in January. Of course, I have no way of knowing if this is true, or how many people he has been with. He was very understanding and looked decently clean, and I didn't notice any sores or lesions. Still, I'm easily taken by health anxiety and I've spent the week googling about every STD imaginable.

I've settled with that thought after my ex-boyfriend, but now I went bare with my current boyfriend and it starts again. I know the best thing is to get tested, but I would have to wait a few months, since you have to wait a bit.

My question is just... do you have problems with thoughts like this? I just would like to stop being paranoid about this.

Also:

http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/law/pdf/HIVtranmsmision.pdf

Could someone tell me if this is real? It says that the chances of getting infected is even without a condom technically very low. I always thought that it would be very sure, that you would be infected after coming in touch with positive cum (or blood on infectable wounds, ass etc). I know that one wrong move could be it, but this left me a bit surprised.

Thank you all in advance!

He's a friend who recently came out as bisexual. He told me that he's been with 3 guys in the past year. The first time was a year ago- was briefly unprotected and he bottomed. He hasn't been tested yet which is another issue altogether.

We had sex and used condoms. However, I ran out and briefly penetrated him for about 5 seconds and gave it a few gentle pumps. I had never had unprotected sex and my curiosity got the best of me. I've done some research and this is called dipping- brief unprotected penetration. I wasn't able to find many statistics on the risk factor of this practice and was looking for some info about my risk.

Like many gay men, I get very anxious about HIV, so this was definitely a bad decision for me regardless of how high or low the risk. I've lost my peace of mind about my health and it sucks. I suggested he get tested and he agreed but it's his decision to do it and there's not much I can do besides that. Just looking for some info and perspective. Thanks!"

I also have enlarged lymph nodes on my right armpit. I have had no other HIV acute symptoms: No soar throat, no fever, no malaise, and no tired feeling.

I'm a 25 yo gay bro and I live in a small town in Canada. I got diagnosed HIV+ almost 6 years ago but I was probably infected when I was 15 or 16 I pretended it never happened and spent years in denial. I didn't get treatment and saw my GP only rarely and he'd yell at me about being dumb and how I was going to die if I didn't go to my specialist appointments so that would give me an excuse to not go back and see him.  

I lost my job and couldn't afford to live in the city any more. After moving I didn't see any doctors for like two years. towards the end of last year I started losing weight, having trouble keeping food down, diarrhea, I was getting pneumonia over and over, i would go to the clinic and get antibiotics but couldn't even bring myself to tell the doctor I was infected with HIV. At the start of this year it sort of sank in that if I didn't do anything I was going to die.  So I started getting my shit in order. I finally saw a specialist at a HIV clinic at the hospital and I got an AIDS diagnosis

I've started medication, which has been working well. my viral load is way down and my CD4 count is up a little.  So I'm on the road to physical recovery.  I guess i'm gonna live, woo.

Kinda makes me wonder what Im going to do with the rest of my life.  I hate being infected and I hate myself for being infected.  I've still never told anyone I'm infected with HIV.  I couldn't even bring myself to tell the nurse at public health, I handed her one of my old blood work results back when I was seeing my GP before I moved, and said I hadn't seen a doctor in years.  I just can't say the words, it hurts too much.

There are nurses and social workers at the clinic where I go and they pester me about how I'm feeling a lot.  the time before last the nurse kept pushing me on like ""How are you adjusting emotionally, as a gay man living with HIV, do you have anyone to talk to?"" and I was just not answering and I just started crying and sobbing ""I don't wanna talk about it"" over and over.  I couldn't look at her the next time I saw her, she tried to say hi and I just sort of stared at my feet and walked away trying not to cry again.

When I go to the clinic sometimes I have to hide in the toilets and cry.  It hurts to think about it, I cry sometimes after I take my pills, I stopped taking my pills for a bit shortly after I started treatment because I just couldn't think about it and would start crying each time I took them. I spend a lot of time just trying not to think about it. I have a lot of nightmares about it.

I'm broken sexually.  I have to shower or wash my hands after I jerk off because I feel dirty about touching my penis or especially my cum.  I cry when I get horny because it makes me think about sex which makes me think about me having HIV.  I can't think about my old boyfriends because I wonder if I gave them HIV.  

I've only had sex once since my diagnosis, I gave in and sucked a guy off a couple years ago shortly after moving here.  I was crying after because I was worried I would infect him.  I would have bad dreams about when he was touching my dick and getting infected that way.  I felt really bad for not telling him even though he wasn't at risk.

I can't talk about it in person but it's a little easier to write about it, but just writing this post has taken me like three hours.  I have to take breaks and think about and do something else or I start to cry.

I just feel really dirty, broken, diseased, sick, ashamed, really ashamed, worthless.  I feel infectious, I feel weird in public like people can see that I have AIDS.  I worry I could infect them which I know is stupid and not possible.

I don't know what to do.  I'm so lonely, I miss having a boyfriend, I miss having friends, I miss my family, I miss feeling happy.

Has anyone else HIV+ gone through this?  Did you get over it?  What did you do?

tl;dr: I got my blood work back today, the meds are working... but how the fuck do keep living as an HIV+ person?"

After that we met several times, had wonderful time together and I started to think I've found the love of my life. And then, before he kissed me for the first time he told me he's HIV positive. I was a bit of shocked and only let him kiss me on the cheek. He said he'll understand if I don't want to meet him anymore. After that we didn't contact for weeks and then he called me. We met and he told me he has never met someone like me before and he misses me a lot. He wants to be together with me. 
I don't know what to do about this. He doesn't want to talk about how he got it, but I believe it's his own fault. I highly doubt that some psycho just ran up to him on the street and stabbed him with a syringe of infected blood. Probably he had unsafe sex, did drugs or something. No matter how low the risk may be, I will not gamble with my health and my life. It is more important to me than any relationships. I'm afraid to even kiss him. He says that if I'm afraid we can not have sex at all. 
The other thing that I'm thinking about is that he probably doesn't have much left to live. I don't want to experience his death, especially if I happen to fall hard for him. 
On the one hand, he's the most wonderful person I've ever met. On the other - I appreciate his being honest with me, but maybe forgetting him is the only way how to protect myself from HIV. I don't know, so confused."

http://www.newsweek.com/truvada-hiv-prevention-proves-highly-effective-368579

""This week, the private insurance company Kaiser Permanente released the largest population study to date that shows the drug is highly effective for preventing HIV transmission. The 2.5-year observational study, published this week in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, involved 657 people. On average, patients took the drug for approximately seven months. The report also provides some insight into whether taking Truvada impacts a person’s sexual behaviors, such as if the person is likely to have more sexual partners or use condoms less.

[. . .]

In the recent study by Kaiser Permanente, the average Truvada user was 37 years old and 99 percent were men who had sex with men. Overall Truvada users were more likely to have multiple sexual partners but not more likely to report having sexual partners who are known to be HIV-positive.

After six months, researchers asked 143 patients on Truvada about their sexual behaviors. In 74 percent of patients, the number of sexual partners hadn’t changed since beginning the drug. Fifteen percent reported having fewer sexual partners, and 11 percent reported an increased number of sexual partners since starting PrEP. More than half (56 percent) of study participants said they hadn’t changed their condom use behavior since starting the drug, while 41 percent admitted they used condoms less frequently.

Since the study didn’t include a control group, it’s not possible to know whether people on PrEP developed sexually transmitted infections (STIs) at a higher rate than people not on the drug, say the researchers. Patients were screened for STIs six months after beginning PrEP, and 30 percent were diagnosed with at least one STI. After one year on the drug, 50 percent of users were diagnosed with an STI, including 33 percent with a rectal STI; 33 percent with chlamydia; 28 percent with gonorrhea; and 5.5 percent with syphilis.""

I'd be on Truvada if I could. (Ontario, alas, combines a weak public drug program with perhaps excessive respect for Health Canada's non-identification of Truvada as a drug to be used as a prophylactic.) No, this is not because I want to get rid of my apartment and just rent out a sling at the local bathhouse. I just like the idea of doing more.

Would this mean I'd drop condoms entirely? No. Truvada-resistant mutations aside, contracting other STIs is nothing I'd like to do, while condom usage has just not been a problem for me. (Other people, mind, might have different priorities.)

Would it mean I'd use condoms less frequently? Possibly. Much depends on the circumstance.

Does this finding change your opinion on Truvada and PrEP?"

**Facts**

Article states **no risk** of Hiv transmission from undetectable viral load, with no *independant* research other than Buzzfeed. Cites NHS which makes no reference to the undetectable issue.

**Reality** 

http://www.cdc.gov/actagainstaids/basics/transmission.html

""Even though having an undetectable viral load GREATLY LOWERS the chance that a person with HIV can transmit the virus to a partner, there is still some risk.

Viral load refers to the amount of HIV in the blood. An undetectable viral load is when the amount of HIV in the blood is so low that it can’t be measured. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces viral load, ideally to an undetectable level, when taken consistently and correctly.

A person with HIV can still potentially transmit HIV to a partner EVEN IF THEY HAVE an undetectable viral load, because HIV MAY STILL BE FOUND in genital fluids (e.g., semen, vaginal fluids). The viral load test only measures virus in blood. A person’s viral load may go up between tests. When this happens, they may be more likely to transmit HIV to partners. Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) increase viral load in genital fluids"".

""...HIV treatment usually brings your viral load down, often so low that it is classed as ‘undetectable’. This doesn’t mean that all HIV has gone – it is still there but in amounts too small to detect.

If someone is on HIV treatment, there is an extremely low risk of them passing HIV...""

3lycjd,Friend Unknowingly Lied About His HIV Status to Me on Grindr,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/3lycjd/friend_unknowingly_lied_about_his_hiv_status_to/,bortles,0,9/22/2015 9:37,82,/r/askgaybros/comments/3lycjd/friend_unknowingly_lied_about_his_hiv_status_to/,NaN,"So my Grindr account is a headless torso right now. I wish I could put my face up but occasionally I look for casual hookups and people have stalked me from the app before and in the past I've had my pictures stolen. Recently, I got a message from another attractive headless torso...

We made small talk off and on for a couple of days and eventually the conversation started to heat up. ""I'm horny"" ""what are you into?"" Etc and then we started to sext. Then he wanted to meet up later in the day. So with hookups, I have this thing where before asking about someone's status I get them all worked up and horny and then ask if they want to bareback. If they say yes, it's an admission that they likely freely engage in risky behavior and are more prone to STIs and I usually end up avoiding sleeping with them. Sometimes they'll even send me unwarranted photographic evidence of various times they've barebacked hookups. And while such pictures are hot, I would not feel comfortable hooking up with them if I knew it didn't take much to make them bareback. If they say no, they still could end up engaging in risky behavior so obviously I take the same precautions across the board but I just feel more comfortable that they don't actively and freely and easily engage in such riskier behavior, I.e., jump to barebacking. Btw is this ""screening process"" unethical to do to potential hookups? Essentially, I don't afford them the benefit of the doubt.

So back to the story. The headless torso said he wanted to bareback. I said ok, thinking in my head I would not feel comfortable hooking up with this person. (Btw, I'm not too concerned about HIV, I'm on PrEP myself, but I'm more so concerned about other STIs. I don't ignore HIV risks, however.) He said: ""if you're neg and clean I'm down."" I said yes, I'm negative with 100% certainty and actually on PrEP. So then I asked this dude about his status, if he was HIV negative or positive. He said he was negative. And finally, I asked for a face pic. Which I probably should have done a long time ago. **Oops** it turned out to be my friend. One of my friends who I personally know to be HIV positive. Out of shock, I blocked him which deleted the conversation, because I didn't want to unknowingly engage with a friend about hooking up or something of this murky ethical nature.

So do I do anything about this? Should I confront my friend about it? Should I inform a mutual friend? Should I just forget about this? I'm kind of unnerving knowing that one of my friends could possibly be lying to potential hookups. But then again it's not really my business what he chooses to do in his personal life. I don't ever think I'll be able to truly fathom the stigma HIV bears on its victims. The weight of judgment must be heavy and hard to deal with in your head on a daily basis. However, right now I'm judging one of my friends who I used to be very fond of."

Apparently two separate tests were taken, neither of which gave a definitive answer, so a more complete blood test was ordered and the result should be back tomorrow. 

Now, I'm not particularly worried that I am infected. He was always open about the fact that he didn't know his status, and he admitted to having unprotected sex with some Grindr hookup at the beginning of the summer. We consequently never engaged in unprotected anal sex, and the risk of transmission for oral sex is statistically very low. 

I am however completely unprepared for an issue of this magnitude to come up in our relationship so early on. I genuinely care about him, and I don't intend to break it off if there is a positive result, but I also feel like he might need space to deal with the trauma of being diagnosed. I don't want to seem like I'm abandoning him, but I really am in over my head here. What do I say if the result is positive? Should I start on Prep?  Has anyone had a similar experience?

I decided to take it among myself to explore my sexuality. I've always played safe, however about 3 months ago, I messed around with this dude. I was having trouble keeping hard with a condom, cause I had gotten off a lot before we met. He kept saying it was the condom and that he's clean and I'm clean we can do without the condom and just make sure not to cum in him. I told him no, absolutely not. 

Fast forward we decide to jack off and play around. He decided to get on top of me and grind on me and then out of nowhere he just sat on my dick for a brief second or two and I was angry and told him to get off. He apologized and kept trying to convince me. I was like no and we stopped. I've been so paranoid since that occasion that I might have HIV. 

Now that I've had my fair share of sexual experiences I'm kinda realizing how scary the reality of STDS and especially HIV is. I want to be safe and smart about this. There's been plenty of times I've met up with guys who insist on going raw because maybe things aren't happening with the condom or want to do something fast and neglect the condom cause it speeds up the process, and always say ""I'm clean, it's okay"". It scares me that so many gay dudes are so willing to go bare just because of the unprovable assumption that someone is ""clean"".  Is there I chance I can have HIV from this dude from the brief moment he sat on me? He claims he's clean, but I don't know... he was so persistent about going bare and I'm really scare. What if he did have HIV and didn't know it and had a high viral load? Can I still catch it? This is probably seen on here a lot but I'm scared. I kept calm for the past month or so, but I'm planning on getting tested next week and the anxiety is coming back. "

I've been pretty lonely since, but everyone told me i should get back out there ASAP. SO i have, I had my first date since my breakup last weekend, and it was amazing. We had a great time. 

He came over about 2pm on Saturday, i had not slept the night before because my sleep schedule is ****ed up(long story). At first it was awkward (like all first dates) especially because we were hanging out at my place for the day and it's always weird to have a stranger in your house. But everything went smoothly. we played some board games (yes i am a geek who enjoys board games) and he seemed to enjoy it too. we got sandwiches for lunch, and then we watched a movie together (Big Hero 6, he'd never seen it and it's one of my favorites). We both cried at the movie, and it was awkward at first, but soon we were comfortable with little touching, like our legs touching on the couch, and then we started comparing feet, and had a thumb war with our big toes, it was really cute and fun.

Then we went out to dinner at my favorite Burmese restaurant, had a few drinks at a bar across the street before because it's a really popular restaurant and there's always at least a 30 min wait on weekends. The conversation flowed naturally, and we talked about really personal stuff that most people would probably think was inappropriate for a first date, but we both spoke candidly about our pasts about things like criminal records, addiction problems, past relationships... intense stuff. it seems like we both have similar histories with all of the above...

After a great Burmese meal, we come back to my place, and at this point it was clear to both of us we were both very attracted to each other and it was time for some lovin' to take place. I was extremely attracted to him, and after the clothes came off i was even more attracted, he's got great body and a fantastic dick. i won't go into too many details about exactly what we did, but the basics are lots of intense making out(kissing with tongues), and lots of oral both ways, and lot of dry humping.

This guy is HIV positive, and he's a bottom, and at one point of our lovemaking I almost had anal sex with him unprotected, lots of hole teasing with my dick and dry humping, but i didn't actually put it in. I think he wanted me too. I don't really know how risky it is to top an HIV positive guy without a condom, but in my mind it wasn't risky at all, and i was very tempted. and when i was kissing him and sucking his dick i didn't feel worried for my safety at all.  I honestly didn't feel in anyway concerned for my safety.

We ended up messing around until about midnight and then he went home because he had to work at 6 the next morning.

What do you guys think about dating an HIV positive guy, and do you think it's weird that i wasn't worried about my safety at all with him. I had no problem making out with him and performing oral sex on him. I don't ever bottom, so that was never an issues in my head (obviously i would never let an HIV poz guy top me unprotected).

What do you guys think about the idea of dating an HIV poz guy, and do you think i am being too reckless based on what i've told you?"

As of now, I really don't know what to do.

I have been really stupid before. I played a lot, thinking that I wouldn't get anything from my countless sexual partners. And I wasn't too smart to use protection all the time. I was stupid.

I'm now 23. Been curious as to what my status was a few months ago so I had myself tested for the first time. It was devastating for me to discover that I am HIV+. It all adds up. I tried to donate blood three years ago. I was turned down. They told me that I was infected with Hepatitis B. The counselor that was assigned to me at the HIV screening told me that maybe, they just didn't want to tell me that I have HIV, so they told me that I have Hep B instead. And just last year, I had shingles. And for one to get shingles, either you have to be really old or your immune system was greatly affected by stress or some virus.

It got me depressed, but I don't show it to people that I am. I told some close friends, but that was it. I didn't go for the treatments. We don't have any money. Well, we do, but my parents are using it all up to fund my post-grad degree. I couldn't tell it to them because I really want to finish this course that I am taking up.

I even pray to God that he can take my life any time now. And sometimes, I get into these deep thoughts about ending my life.

Then the most unexpected thing happened. It was like a love story that had butterflies in my stomach fluttering. In an app that I was using (WeChat), you can see people who's nearby. I saw this guy and he is hot. Seems as if everything I am looking for in a guy is in him. I sent him a message but he didn't hit back. Typical of hot guys on any app that I know of.

A day later, as I was heading home from the mall, I saw this guy ride the same bus that I was on. It was dark so I didn't notice what he looked like. But I sure did noticed that he was taking glances at me. I was trying to take a good look at him but as I have said, it was dark so I couldn't really see what he looked like.

On my stop, I got off the bus and looked back at him. I was hoping that he would have a WeChat so that he could find me there or that I could find him there. But who am I kidding? It is like asking for something really impossible.

I got home and was just watching tv when I got a message from the guy I PMed the night before. It was odd. He ignored me before and now, he is suddenly interested? Then after some hi's and hello's, he asked me if I just got home.

Then it hit me. I immediately asked him if he was the one that I saw at the bus. We both confirmed it by stating what the other was wearing. It was him. The one that I shared a bus ride with.

We talked over the phone and found out that he isn't as shallow as I thought. He's not into sex, but was really turned on when he saw me at the bus.

We met the night after. Since I don't know what he really looks like in person, I just relied on his pics on the app. He was wearing thick clothing and sunglasses on most of his pictures so I really couldn't grasp what he looks like. But when I saw him approaching me, my jaw dropped. He's the most perfect guy I could ever dream of. He was wearing a tank top, a cap, and he was riding his motorbike. I hopped on and we then had a few drinks on a local bar. Then we went back to his place for some cuddles.

He told me that he wanted to fuck me, but I declined. Even if I wanted to so bad.

We are now hitting off pretty good, but at the back of my mind, the issue of me being HIV+ still lingers.

Most people get turned off when one tells them that they are HIV+. I don't want to lose my guy.

Any advice on what I should do?"

A few years ago I began dating a guy who was my age (22) and perfectly healthy. After eventually moving our relationship to a sexual level, I made sure to only have safe sex. Nonetheless, I quickly developed some symptoms I'd never experienced before. After the first few times we had sex, I felt very weak (I could hardly move across the house) and had developed flu-like symptoms.

Naturally, I took to WebMD. I began to get severely worried, because the symptoms I was exhibiting were very similar to those who have contracted HIV. I went to the doctor immediately, and took a series of blood tests. The first test came back negative for the flu. Uh-oh. Why was I so sick then? During this period I began to become so severely worried that I had contracted HIV that it became so overwhelming that I broke down crying out of fear. Had I just ruined my life? Despite using condoms, what if the virus had been transferred through some other means, such as my mouth, a small cut somewhere, or what if the condom itself failed (after all, they're not 100% effective).

The height of my panic came at 8pm on a Thursday night. I had received a call from the doctor's office. While waiting on hold, I was freaking out. When does a doctor's office ever call a patient so late if not because of a serious issue? Once the doctor got on the line, he told me to come into the office the first thing the next morning. Due to protocol, he told me he could not tell me my test results over the phone.

Cue the panic attack. I became so worried that I, through a trembling voice, asked the doctor, to please, please, tell me my test results because I was panicking and would not be able to sleep. He paused, and during this moment I was actually shaking. He informed me that I tested positive. In that split second I envisioned having to tell my mother (who did not even know that I was gay) that I had become HIV-positive. He completed the sentence by saying that I had tested positive for mononucleosis.

From thereafter I swore to never risk that type of panic ever again. And I've held up to that promise for two years because it was the most scared I've ever been in my life. Despite taking all the necessary precautions, I just felt that it was just never worth the risk (however small). I'm so afraid of being put through an experience like that again that I have not pursued healthy relationships because this fear is still so vivid. I have retreated from meeting anybody because of this fear.

I guess I just wanted to know if any other gaybros here have experienced this type of feeling, and how they've been able to move forward. Cheers."

Nothing serious - never anal. Just blowjobs/kissing/rimjobs and always checked with the guy if he was clean or not.

To reassure myself though, most of these symptoms are super common and probably are due to my lack of sleep and stress from first year at university. 

But I think it might be time to finally make that trip and get one of those free 20minute reveal tests. Was just wondering if anybody had any experiences to tell about these tests? I hear they people who do them are really friendly and it's all confidential but there's just that thought scaring me at the back of my mind...saying ""what if"" (also doesn't help that finals are next week and I can't focus on my studies)

I know im not a big personality on here nor have I ever been anywhere, but i want to announce it to you guys. Ever since my diagnosis, hiding this has caused more problems than not. Im making a commitment to change myself finally and part of it is accepting everything about myself, including this. 

Edit: Jumped the gun and presssd send as bf came in. But seriously, HIV caused me to feel like i was worthless. Like i validated every single fear my mom had when i was thrown out the closet. I felt dirty, like a whore that got what he deserved, and at such a fucking young point in my life.

But i realize the more i hide it, the less people see the reality of having HIV instead of the terror-filled 80/90's version. On a list of things that can fuck my day, HIV is pretty low, somewhere with ""running out of homey mustard and not even-ing"" and ""ask to dance in public"". I want the world to see this. And as i evolve, i want it to be known that people with HIV are as close to normal as you can get...we just happen to have a permanent buddy tgat wanted to dive into our DNA.

Edit2: Than you everyone for your kind words. The next step for me is tellinh a friend that should have known a long time ago."

I would like to thank you for all the work and information in this website 

but something unusual happened in my case 

In the last Tuesday (12/01)  I performed unprotected oral sex with a transexual escort she rimmed my *** (i didnt)   
I was heavily drunk and when i was performing oral sex in her and i noticed (after 10 minutes or something like that) some strange things like HPV warts and i stopped doing that, after this we performed protective anal sex 
and i let her came in my face a little bit dropped in my eye (it gets a little irritated i washed with fresh water some minutes later it was ok again) and a little bit ran to my mouth too but i spit it fast 

I have read many posts over here, and i know the chances of getting HIV in oral sex/semen in eye is low but how about the HPV  wart can this thing make the chance of HIV contamination higher? I dont know the stats of the transexual HIV but i totally guess she was positive because HPV warts. I cant sleep since then. I dont care if i get HPV or something like that my real fear is about HIV. 
I even thought about suicide, i cant stop thinking about this i think im going crazy!

I think it happens to us all every now and then. I went to a bar, got drunk, found someone on Grindr, and we had ""sort of sex"" in my car. I'm going to graphically describe the part of the encounter I'm worried about because I think that it's essential to answering the question.

We had one condom and no lube. I was very drunk and had already gotten off a couple times yesterday, so I was briefly inside of him before losing my erection. After that, he asked if he could fuck me. I told him yes, he took the condom off of me, put it on himself, and tried to fuck me. I think he may have only gone in like halfway and there was no back and forth due to the pain of having no lube. He tried maybe three times before I told him to stop and we quit.

I'm worried because the condom scenario (both of us fucking each other with the same condom, essentially) means that we more or less had unprotected sex. And this isn't an individual that I'd trust doing such a thing with. He told me that he was tested in April and has had probably five sexual partners since. He claimed that he's had unprotected sex with one person since April, his ex-boyfriend who said he was clean.

I've already convinced this guy to go to the heath department to get tested with me tomorrow. So I guess we'll know in the coming days. But does anyone know the odds of transmitting diseases like this? Is it less likely than having completely unprotected sex? Also, is there anything else I should be doing right now? Thank you!

EDIT/UPDATE:
We're both going to the health department tomorrow to get tests. Our health department has a harm reduction program, so they may offer PEP for free (I read that some places do). Also, there are instant HIV tests (which the health department hopefully has), so tomorrow morning I should know if he has HIV or not.

EDIT/UPDATE 2:
I've been reading around to find a similar scenario to know if contracting HIV would have even been possible in this situation. According to the article I've linked to below, HIV dies upon exposure to air and there's no danger in contracting the disease from reusing a condom. Nonetheless, I'm still going to get tested tomorrow.

Why haven't these kits taken off - is it because the price is too high?  I guess both sides would want to see the other's results, so it would be £40 a time.   

Or would it not be socially acceptable / would it be too much of a boner-killer to ask for a test immediately before sex?

Can you see use of these testing kits becoming normalized, at least among certain sections of gay population? Why aren't they being talked about more?"

So I thought I’d ask here, since I’m sure many of you have been tested before. I’d really appreciate it if you could help me out! I’m located in North Carolina, USA if it helps.

First of all, how do I set up the appointment? I don’t have a general practitioner. Do I just call my local health department and say “I want to be tested for HIV and STDs”, or should I try to contact some type of special clinic? I don’t have a Planned Parenthood in my area. Do I have to specify what infections I want to be tested for, or do they have a test that covers all the common ones? I’m a university student, do university health clinics usually do STD tests?

Secondly, what should I expect at the actual appointment? What do they do in order to test you for STDs? Do they just draw blood, or is anything else involved? What kind of questions should I expect to be asked? How long should it typically take for me to get my results back?

Finally, I’m just really nervous about the whole process, since I’ve never done it before. Is there anything else that I should be aware of beforehand? How do they inform me of my results, do they call me or mail me something? What happens if I do have HIV or other STDs? I’ve not had sexual contact with anyone in at least four months and have never noticed any symptoms, but in the past I wasn’t always safe when having sex, and I know that some diseases can stay dormant for years before anything happens.

Thanks for your help, and sorry for asking such a basic question. I just haven’t been able to find the answers I was looking for, and I’m tired of putting this off.

I met my ex about 9 months ago for a coffee date, which turned into going away that night on a weekend camping trip.  The relationship was awesome at the beginning, he was upfront and told me he is HIV+, but said he is undetectable.  His honesty built trust with me right away.  We were inseparable from the get go, always spending the night at each others place, nothing seemed to bug us.  I went away on a business trip for a week..when I returned my ex was over a hour late from picking me up from the airport.  When he arrives, his pupils were huge, and he wasn't acting himself.  I questioned him when we got home and he told me he did some coke before he left.  I shrugged it off, bitched at him for driving high and we moved on.  (He was actually high on Crystal Meth, which I discovered later)  a few weeks passed and I was on his laptop surfing around with him.  I stumbled upon a email thread he had with some random guy on craigslist while I was away,  it ended with his address and phone number.  I burst into tears and confronted him.  He told me that he was just chatting for fun and that nothing happened.  Fast forward to a overnight trip we did a few weeks after that.  I asked him when he was drunk about the email again and he said the guy came over, but he turned him away because he was ugly.  Well in my eyes thats still cheating because the guy still came over.  We got in a MASSIVE fight over this.  After the trip we had a lot of ups and downs, went on many many trips together and then i discovered that he was doing crystal meth.  I got so mad at him and told him it had to stop....He promised it would...it never did...

He got me drunk one night and got me to try it....I was angry at him for a few weeks after, because I liked it and was starting to crave it.  I was even more mad that his meth usage would be hurting his undetectable status and thus putting my health at risk.  How could someone that says they love you do this to me?  

It got so bad one night I went over really drunk (background info,  I have a alcohol problem where I drink excessively when I'm feeling really shitty or depressed) we got in a big argument, he made fun of my weight (I'm 6ft3 and 190lbs..but not overly muscular..and my body is a issue for me) I ended up attempting to take my life and that was the last straw..the next day we ended everything, which i know is the right decision....The shitty part is that I worry about him every day, I worry about his health, I worry about what he's doing and I have constant nightmares where I find out he is dead.  

I told my friends everything, and my friends know his coworkers and his coworkers went to management (he works for a major airline) and management is going to ask him if he wants help, and if he says no, he will be drug tested and fired.

3zewiv,Boyfriend diagnosed with HIV/AIDS....Wanting to be supportive but it's so hard....,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/3zewiv/boyfriend_diagnosed_with_hivaidswanting_to_be/,bfthrowaway2016,90,1/4/2016 6:08,119,/r/askgaybros/comments/3zewiv/boyfriend_diagnosed_with_hivaidswanting_to_be/,NaN,"So, hey guys. I made a throwaway account to ask y'all about this. I've already posted this is r/gay and r/lgbt but haven't gotten much response. I'm really conflicted and I'd love some advice.

My boyfriend (31) and I (25) have been together for about a year. I love him more than any other guy I've ever been with. No one has ever ""got"" me the way he gets me. 

I've had to become his only support system after he has essentially closed himself off from his abusive and manipulative family members. He lives with me, I helped him get a job at the place I work, and we both share my car for driving to work. None of this I really have an issue with, because I want him to succeed and do well.

For the first year of our relationship, we have always used condoms. 

I have asked him to get tested a few times.

About 6 months ago, he moved in with me and my roommate. Our sex life sort of dwindled for the next few months. We talked about it several times but it never really got back to the way it was at first. Which is normal I guess. 

About 3 months ago, he started having really bad headaches. Ended up going to the hospital about 3 weeks ago when his vision was affected. Was diagnosed with not just HIV, but full on AIDS. The headaches were caused by a brain infection (toxoplasmosis) as a result of his lowered immune system. 

I was tested that night and it came back negative. The last time we had sex was about a month before the test and it was protected. I'm pretty sure I've dodged the bullet but they want me to get tested once more just to be sure.

Even before his diagnosis, we had talked about what we would do. I decided I would be okay with going on PrEP and staying by his side.

Well, the diagnosis has happened, and we're still wading through the post-diagnosis stage. My boyfriend doesn't have insurance so he hasn't been able to get on a stable medication regimen yet. 

Also, we share a car (my car) and work separate shifts at the same company, where I got him a job. So in the morning, he drives me to work, takes the car, comes back at 3 to start his shift, I leave at 5 and take the car, then I come back at midnight to pick him up. Imagine doing that--it's very exhausting. Especially because we work 6 days a week. 

I'm just starting to feel like I've compromised and given and given all I can. I've had to put my dreams on the back burner to care for him, look out for him, be his savior in all these situations. It's just getting frustrating because though I know he appreciates it, I'm not sure if he's aware JUST how unhappy I am right now. I'm not sure how to talk about it because I'm a very accommodating person who has the instinct to hide my feelings. 

I'm having all sorts of ugly thoughts that I don't want to share with him. I'm 25, do I need the burden and stress of caring for an HIV+ boyfriend? Should I be with someone who lifts me up instead of someone I'm constantly having to lift up? Am I being selfish? I feel like all this pressure is on me, to train him at our job and deal with our boss to make sure he keeps his job and does well, to stay by his side through this HIV thing and be a good boyfriend, etc. 

If anyone has any thoughts or words of wisdom please let me know. 

TL; DR: I'm 25, he's 31, together for a little over a year now. I've had to become my boyfriend's only family and support system since he and his family have ceased contact. He's had a hard life and I love him. But it turns out he's had not just HIV, but full AIDS since before we started dating. I begged him to at least get an at-home test a few months after we started dating. We were protected throughout our relationship and I tested negative the night he tested positive. Now I'm wondering why I'm even still in this relationship after all the compromising and giving I've had to do. 

EDIT: I forgot to mention that he is essentially my first long-term boyfriend. All I've had before him was hookups and a short 2-month fling.

* Person X then has sex with person Y on day 2. Is person Y in any greater risk because of the day before? (I'm assuming not a single day as you can take PEP)


So I'm essentially asking 

1. Can/does infection occur immediately?
2. how long after becoming infected with the virus does a person then have the ability to infect another person? 
3. Is there a set time or does it vary from individual?

I do sleep unprotected with my boyfriend and I got tested for STDs 3 months ago and tested negative for everything but this is getting worse and it's starting to worry me a bit. I've read that HIV causes white tongue and while I'm planning on getting tested when my doctor can get me in, does it sound likely that it could be an STI/STD? Can anyone with STD experience please give some insight? Me and my boyfriend haven't slept with anyone else (at least I hope he hasn't) and he isn't showing any symptoms similar to this so am I being too paranoid?

Edit: went to an urgent care clinic, got diagnosed with oral thrush but getting bloodwork done soon because the physician said getting oral thrush at 21 is uncommon so she thinks my immune system may be compromised. Here's hoping its not anything serious =/"

 I'm kind of shocked and impressed at modern HIV medicine based on the fact that I've been with a guy with HIV for a month sucking his dick (without protection) licking his Precum, I touched his blood and let it dry on my finger, we made out for hours and hours, he ate my ass, I touched one of his open wounds and had a bath with him while he had an open wound. We rubbed dicks together, deepthroated each other, he came all over my chest, he popped tons of my pimples and I popped some of his, and I'm still HIV negative. If I can learn anything from this experience it will be to be less fearful of undetectable guys."

Thanks to everyone for the input; yall helped me think about the whole issue in different ways and while I didn't agree with everyone it was interesting to see the different perspectives. I decided to come through with the news sooner rather than later; tonight while we were out having a couple drinks I told him.

And he was... very okay with it! Like, *almost* to the point of being flippant. Turns out he's been in a serodiscordant relationship before; his ex-husband is poz and was the whole time they were together. He asked about my health and I explained a couple things about my numbers and my treatment to let him know where I'm at. He reiterated that it was a non-issue for him and I told him that he needs to pay attention to his feelings about it and if they ever turn negative (pun not intended haha) I need him to be honest with himself and with me as well.

Thanks to all for helping me work up the nerve, I really appreciate it. Talking about this makes me very uncomfortable and there are very few people who know (and I haven't dated since I was diagnosed a year and a half ago) but I was very relieved once it was out in the open.

Basically, when i was 18 i had unprotected sex with my boyfriend who was older than i was. I few months in i noticed painful lumps on either side of my groin. Obviously, as a stupid young guy who had no idea of the risks of sex i realized i must of contracted a STD. I began to get weaker and was definite i had HIV. It also worried me because when i used to ask to be the top his response was ""its not because i dont want to but i cant"", but he never gave a full response why when i asked. 

Skip ahead a year or so when he broke up for no reason. I had this horrible poison in my mind sending me into deep depression. I was convinced i was HIV+ and possibly had full blown AIDs. I thought to myself ill just leave it as i didn't care if i lived or died as it had progressed to much already and i didn't want to live with AIDs anyway, id prefer to be dead.

Once i started to get a grip, i realized i should get tested to confirm it and maybe get treatment. The full STD tests came back negative and i was completely clean. Even though this is the case i still have pains in my groin and i would not believe the doctors. I went back  6 months later and was tested again. I was still 100% clean.

I am now 23 and i have not been sexually active since this all started due to the worry of passing on the HIV. Even though im not positive but i think i am. What the hell should i do? Is it possible its not been picked up in the tests? Anyone experienced the same? I know my body is not how it should be, but i think the doctors think im a hypochondriac and scared to go anymore.

This is me, with my anxiety problems causing me to behave irrationally. But hear me out.

I went to my local testing center for anonymous HIV testing today - I used to get tested regularly but haven't in the last couple years. I have had a few flings since then, nothing high risk (protection for anal sex, mostly oral sex) so I have no reason to believe I am positive. But, it's important to know your status and all that.

This testing center is new to me: they're GBT-focused and have a great reputation. However, I was kind of a ball of worry because that's the way I am. They do a rapid (nearly instant fingerprick) test, and a 2-week turnaround blood draw test. After the fingerprick test was done, he said ""This test shows no signs of HIV antibodies"" or something like that. I said ""Good deal"" and he said ""Good deal"". Then he wrote down the date for me to call back for my results from the mail-away test in 2 weeks.

Now, I was happy about it, went home, had a nap, then woke up in a cold sweat after having a dream that I was positive, and not unconvinced that what he actually said was ""This test shows signs of HIV antibodies.""

I am now sitting here, thinking about how crazy I am, while also worrying that I misheard him and I tested positive with selective hearing. So here's my question: If you get an HIV positive result - even on only the first test - they give you a whole talk about next steps, how positive results also need to be confirmed, and tell you how to find counseling, right? He wouldn't just reply ""Good deal"" to me, right? That would be like...insensitive and unhelpful. (I think he didn't even say the word positive when we were talking about the test. But he didn't say the word negative either.)

Sorry - I know this is probably crazy (and a reminder that I should see someone about my anxiety), but I'm hoping to hear about what happens after an initial positive result to put my mind at rest for two weeks while I wait for the confirmation test to know for certain."

I allowed him to rape me and did not tell him I was positive. After he finished he threw me outside his house and threatened me again.

So I have been ill for about a month, and the doctors have been running various tests, and found a parasite that is likely causing a lot of my issues. When the doctor mentioned they had found something I was so relieved since it could be treated. Then she mentioned the parasite had a strong presence in HIV positive people, and my heart dropped. I had a HIV test and will get the results in a few days to a week, but a lot of the symptoms I was having match the post exposure illness you get.

So here I am, potentially positive at 23 and trying to prepare myself for that.  I get tested regularly, and was negative in November. I have never had unprotected sex, or a condom break, and in the past 6 months I have only topped. So I guess that leaves oral or just really shitty luck. I am trying not to panic until the results are back, but it was hard to be told ""Oh well yeah, could be HIV"" and then having up to a week to contemplate my previous life choices and hate myself for being lax enough to possibly catch a chronic disease.

I bottomed for a friend about a month ago. He didn't wear a condom, and I was aware of it. He assured me he didn't have anything, and asked if I had anything. We discussed our most recent tests and decided we trusted one another.

Since then, though, I've been racking my brain with concerns. Constantly looking up transmission statistics, thinking, ""What if he didn't know? What if he contracted it, hadn't been tested within a proper window of time, and just thought he was negative?"" I got a routine test at my local LGBT clinic today, where I get tested regularly, and my rapid result was negative - so I know I didn't have anything at the time that we hooked up. I won't find out for a week if anything comes out of the more robust test. 

Prior to this encounter, I'd never engaged in that kind of risky behavior. I know the relative odds of transmission in my situation are less than 2% per exposure. What isn't helping is that it's been about a month exactly, and I've come down with some mild cold symptoms. Again, I know that people tend to overreact to such common symptoms and they aren't necessarily indicative of anything. Before someone rages against me for not rifling through old posts to find what I'm looking for, please know that I have. I just don't feel like I can talk to anyone about it in person right now, even if this is all just one big unnecessary scare (I'm pretty sure it is). The counselor at the clinic was upbeat but less than helpful, as I explained why I was paranoid and he basically just reiterated that I'd get my results in a week and I should be proud of myself for being cautionary. I left feeling like I hadn't really done anything.

44jfaq,Hey gaybros... I'm launching www.undetectable.me to help make dating in a world with HIV a bit easier. It's a non-commercial project of mine to list the Top 10 Questions someone might have in a mixed-status relationship and I want it to be brilliant so I'd love your feedback.,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/44jfaq/hey_gaybros_im_launching_wwwundetectableme_to/,jasenlee,126,2/6/2016 18:04,22,/r/askgaybros/comments/44jfaq/hey_gaybros_im_launching_wwwundetectableme_to/,NaN,"**My Story in 4 sentences:**

Exactly one year ago today I was diagnosed with HIV and since that time it has been quite a year. 

Lots of ups and lots of downs but one thing I've learned is dating can be a bit more tough when you are HIV+ especially since there is so much misinformation out there. 

When you find a guy you like and you have to disclose you almost get that awkward feeling of coming out of the closet all over again. 

I've hidden my status from a lot of people for the last year but I've reached a point where I'm no longer ashamed, I'm no longer hiding and will no longer let the stigma of HIV fester because I'm going to help fight it with projects like this. 

**The Problem:**

It's no secret that the dating world can be a little tough, especially with so much misinformation out there. A lot of us, both positive and negative, have run into those situations where you meet that guy who catches your eye. You strike up a bit of conversation and when you want to take things further your presented with something that could be a bit of an awkward conversation… disclosing your HIV status. Let's make it easier by taking the fear out of the unknown. 

**The Goal:**

The whole goal is to break down barriers  and provide a quick an easy site *(with a memorable URL -  [www.undetectable.me](http://www.undetectable.me))* where you as an HIV+/Undetectable individual can provide a source of unbiased information which hits a lot of the questions someone might have about what it means to be in a serodiscordant relationship. 

**My Solution:**

I want to make that easier with a simple website that provides the **top 10** questions that might be on the mind of someone who is either HIV+/Undetectable or HIV-negative but dating is on the horizon. So, meet someone online, at a bar or somewhere else and they have limited info about what it means to be undetectable? Send them here. 

I want it to be a dead simple site that is easy to navigate on mobile and desktop with sources to good 3rd party info. I'd like it to be conversational in style instead of clinical so it appeals to the widest audience.

**Where I need your help:**

I'd like your feedback on what the top things are on your mind when dating whether you are an HIV+ man with an undetectable status or if you are HIV-negative and want to educate yourself a bit more. My humble ask if you have the time…

**1)** Review my website -&gt; [www.undetectable.me](http://www.undetectable.me) and look at the questions I have. 

**2)** Suggest changes to what is there on questions and content. I'm open to changing all questions to list. What did I miss? What concerns you? What kind of data would you like to see? BTW, I didn't fill out all the content pages yet because I know questions might change.

**3)** Tell me what you love and hate overall. **Be BRUTAL with feedback**. You aren't going to hurt my feelings. 

**A couple of caveats:**

* This is a free / non-commercial website. It's something I just started working on last night. I'm not affiliated with any special HIV/AIDS organizations, etc. It's just a personal project I think is important.

* I realize it is a bit more narrow in scope with focusing on HIV+/Undetectable gay men right now and I don't want to exclude people but I'm of the school of thought that you should start small and build from there. If this is helpful to others and successful I want to make purpose built sites like this one which address some more specific topics for other communities hit by the HIV/AIDS crisis. Please don't think I'm trying to exclude anyone. This was just an easy way to start.

* Consider this beta right now but I plan on launching it ""officially"" in a couple of days so anything is up for change. Can't say it enough... share any feedback. I'm open to change.

**Final Thoughts:**

While it's a modest site please help make this a reality by taking the time to share what you think - I know I keep saying that (sorry). Also, even though it's still just getting started feel free to share what I'm doing in your social networks, etc. so we can get more eyes and feedback on this. 

**tl;dr: I'm creating a website of 10 simple questions people might have when dating and one person is HIV+/Undetectable. The  goal is to break down barriers, help end the HIV/AIDS stigma and help people find love and companionship.**

He comes in the bathroom behind me and says that he needs to tell me something. He tells me that he is HIV positive and that he's been infected for 2 years. What an absolute asshole/dick face/cunt/AHHHHHHHHHHHHh. 

The first thing I did was throw up (involuntarily). He was rubbing my back and he said he's sorry he didn't tell me and that he knew If he had told me I wouldn't have even given him a second glance. I told him he was wrong if he would have told me everything would be the same but we would use a condom. But since he lied and probably gave me HIV he had to get out of my house and never speak to me again. Then he says please forgive me and I tell him to get the fuck out.

He walked towards me I opened the door and pointed outside he walked out the door turned around and said please don't hold this against me I really love you. I slammed the door in his face and the last thing I hear is him yelling call me. I'll call you when hell freezes over how about that?

I did this by following 2 simple rules:

1. **Don't have a ton of anal sex with casual partners**. [Anal is far and away the riskiest sexual activity for HIV transmission](http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/policies/law/risk.html). Blowjobs and mutual masturbation are much safer than anal.

2. If you do have anal sex, **use condoms and/or PrEP** to protect yourself from HIV. If you're a huge buttslut and have access to it, PrEP is probably a good call. (You'll still want to use condoms to avoid other STIs though.)

In addition, you need to realize that you, *and only you* are responsible for your own sexual health and safety.

**Only hooking up with guys who say they're negative *will not* protect you from HIV** because (a) boys lie, and (b) the guys most likely to infect you with HIV are the ones who were recently infected and don't know they're positive. On the flip side, guys who know they're positive, are in treatment with a low viral load, and who disclose their status before sex [are a much lower transmission risk](http://www.aidsmap.com/No-one-with-an-undetectable-viral-load-gay-or-heterosexual-transmits-HIV-in-first-two-years-of-PARTNER-study/page/2832748). Bottom line: ""Neg ub2"" is not a safer sex strategy.

**Don't count on anyone else to protect you from STIs**. Be specific in your conversations with your partners about sexual health and safety. Bring your own condoms to the hookup and use them. Don't let anyone cum in your ass, even with a condom on. If you have a lot of anal partners and/or don't use condoms 100% of the time--and yes, that one time you were drunk and fucked bare *does* mean that you don't use condoms 100% of the time--get on PrEP.

And finally, **you need to accept the fact that hooking up with a bunch of strangers puts you at risk of HIV and other STIs.** Everything in life comes with risk. If you absolutely cannot handle the possibility of ever getting an STI, stay home and jerk off. 

Finally, while you certainly don't want to get HIV if you can avoid it, contracting a manageable chronic condition is not the end of the world. Every other STI is curable or treatable especially if you catch it early, so you'll want to get tested every few months if you're slutting it up.

And that's it! Now go get laid."

Even though PEP makes the person taking it much more safe from catching HIV, does it also mean that partners who are not on PEP cant catch it? 

Like, is it possible to 'carry' the virus for a few days, before it dies and entirely leaves your system from lack of RNA replication. And could you then pass it to a partner who is not on PEP?

I havent really heard much about this specific instance; and im curious because i started truvada after a broken condom (albeit with a guy who 'says' he is negative). Are any potential partners safe from HIV, or is it just the person taking the pill?"

I've been getting more and more frustrated with the way people talk about PreP and gay sexuality in general. I've read a lot of (sometimes more, sometimes less reasonable) posts about it, and I've been wondering if I am the only one excited about PreP.  

First I wanna try to sum up what kind of arguments are out there. Basically, what a lot of people are saying is this: 

1. On PreP, the 'bad' slutty gay guys are gonna start creaming asses bareback like crazy. Barebacking is bad.

2. What about all those other STD's? Ohwmagawd, stuff could get resistant to antibiotics!

3. A responsible guy who goes on PreP would use the Pills AND Condoms, because PreP isn't 100% safe.

4. PreP sluts are gonna cause resistant strains of the HI-Virus.

Did I miss something? I hope I got all of it.

About Point 1:

A lot(!) of people are already having bareback sex. We would NOT have the whole HIV-Epidemic if everybody just always used condoms. In a 2008 Study, 30% of gay men reported condomless sex with a casual partner. That was before TaP was even heard of (The Swiss Statement dropped in 2008), so I imagine the numbers are even higher now. Is that a bad thing? Why do we as gay men constantly have to label the shit we do as 'bad' or 'good'. 
I don't do bareback sex. I am very scared of HIV. But to be honest, a little part of me is jealous of the people reckless enough to just go with it. I watch tons of bareback porn. And be fucking real with yourself – you do too. Bareback Porn is fucking exploding. Sean Cody is dropping bareback movies for fucks sake. Why do you think do they do that? 

Easy:
Sex without condoms is way hotter. Can we all please, please, please stop being so fucking hypocritical about that. On EVERY fucking Porn-Streaming Site the most watched videos are bareback. That's not my opinion and that's not 'bad' – it's just the way it is.
So yes, with PreP becoming more available, Condom use is gonna go down. Because Prep protects you against HIV, and because if it wasn't for HIV, most of us would not use condoms at all. 
If it wasn't for HIV, the whole sexual revolution of the 60's and 70's would have gone on, and the whole way most of us were socialized and educated about sex would have been completely different.

That bring's me to point 2. Other STD's. 

What is the big deal? First of all, even if you use condoms consistently, you still can catch other STD's. 
The risk is reduced for anal, but who the fuck uses condoms for oral? Be real about that. The whole argument is ridiculous. You can get Syphilis, Herpes, Gonorrhea and Chlamydia through oral. At least if people are on PreP, they get screened for that shit way more often than they would if they weren't. I know this might be uncomfortable, but if you are sexually active at all, you are at risk. 
But hey, good news. All of that shit is (still) treatable. 
And you know what else? Even if every single gay guy cut off his dick and turned to priesthood, those STD's still will end up resistant to antibiotics at some point. Straight people have sex too, and straight people also get STD's. Why is it that we blame our gross, 'bad' gay sexual desires for something that basically everybody is responsible for. Our Sex, and the STD's we catch are in no way morally worse than the infections of like, the other fucking 90% of the planet. 

About Point 3:

That actually is the dumbest thing I have heard so far. Yes, If you want to be super safe, you can use condoms and PreP. Nothing wrong with that. You could also fucking wrap your whole body in cling wrap and rub your dick on the corner of a table while your hookup who stands three feet away from you does the same. 
I'm not saying that you shouldn't use condoms while on PreP, but the KAISER Study actually has pretty sweet results. No new Infections. 99% 
I know, there is a problem with adherence, but even with people only taking four of seven pills a week, the level of protection was over 80%. Consistent condom use reduces your HIV risk by 70%! PREP IS SAFER THAN CONDOMS!
So you could just as well say someone who only uses condoms for every single encounter is doing something wrong if he doesn't additionally go on PreP. If all you do is look at the risk of HIV-transmission, only taking Prep and getting your ass creamed every other night is preferable to using condoms. Condoms break. 

I'm almost done, I promise. About point 4. 

Yeah, that might be a thing. It also might not be if people are adherent. We also might see some sort of long lasting PreP/Vaccine Injection that we could get within the next decade and that only has to be renewed like once a month. Adherence would be pretty easy with that.
Also, this: 
http://www.aidsmap.com/Drug-resistance-acquired-during-HIV-PrEP-rapidly-disappears-after-medication-is-discontinued/page/3020093/

So, to finish this off, I wanna talk about HIV in general. What's up with the fucking stigma around here? Think about this for a second:
Medically, Diabetes is way worse than HIV. With Diabetes, shit only gets worse. With HIV, some studies actually show that your lifespan increases, because most negative people don't get a complete checkup and bloodwork done every four months. 
So why do we judge people who have bareback sex, but are completely fine with fat people. Maybe that comparison doesn't work perfectly, but I guess you get my point. 
So if you are like me, if you are reading way too long discussions about HIV and PreP on reddit, you probably also have HIV-Phobia or some sort of fucking OCD going on. Why the fuck would you still be reading otherwise? I ask you this: 
Do you also sometimes, even if everything you did on your last hookup was safe and all your fears are irrational, have this tiny voice in your head that goes: 'If you just weren't gay, your HIV risk would be lower. Just by having gay sex you are doing something wrong, and if you end up with HIV, it's your fault.'? 
I sometimes do. It sucks. But that is fucking classic internalized gay-self-hatred and has nothing to do with PreP. We should get over that.

However, I kept finding myself  having to refrain from the 'I'm so sorry' responses that seem to come as a reaction to news like this. To make matters worse for him, he's still madly in love with his ex but his ex doesn't acknowledge him. This is really besides the point of my upcoming HIV question but is part of his depression problem in conjunction with his recent diagnosis. He feels that his ex should take some responsibility for his diagnosis but doesn't. I don't know the context of his ex's diagnosis, if it was prior to their relationship or if it was the result of cheating. I don't know if they were tested at the start of their relationship. 
My question is how can be supportive to him in helping him come to terms with his diagnosis? Is it even possible to help? I don't want to provide pity, just be their as a friend.

###The History of HIV

AIDS was first clinically observed in 1981 in the United States. The initial cases were a cluster of injecting drug users and homosexual men with no known cause of impaired immunity who showed symptoms of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), a rare opportunistic infection that was known to occur in people with very compromised immune systems. 

Soon thereafter, an unexpected number of homosexual men developed a previously rare skin cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Many more cases of PCP and KS emerged, alerting U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a CDC task force was formed to monitor the outbreak.

A reconstruction of its genetic history shows that the HIV pandemic almost certainly originated in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, around 1920. 

There is evidence that humans who participate in bushmeat activities, either as hunters or as bushmeat vendors, commonly acquire SIV. However, SIV is a weak virus which is typically suppressed by the human immune system within weeks of infection. 

It is thought that several transmissions of the virus from individual to individual in quick succession are necessary to allow it enough time to mutate into HIV. 

Furthermore, due to its relatively low person-to-person transmission rate, SIV can only spread throughout the population in the presence of one or more high-risk transmission channels, which are thought to have been absent in Africa before the 20th century. The earliest well documented case of HIV in a human dates back to 1959 in the Congo. 

The virus may have been present in the United States as early as 1966, but the vast majority of infections occurring outside sub-Saharan Africa (including the U.S.) can be traced back to a single unknown individual who became infected with HIV in Haiti and then brought the infection to the United States some time around 1969.

---

###What Are the Risks for Gay &amp; Bi Men?

A 2007 study analyzing two large population surveys found that ""the majority of gay men had similar numbers of unprotected sexual partners annually as straight men and women.""

However, a 2006 study found that men who reported 4 or more male sexual partners were at increased risk of HIV infection. 

Study participants who reported amphetamine or heavy alcohol use before sex were more likely to have HIV or other sexually transmitted infections.

In the United States in particular, a new wave of infection is being blamed on the use of methamphetamine, known as crystal meth. 

Research presented at the 12th Annual Retrovirus Conference in Boston in February 2005 concluded that using crystal meth or cocaine is the biggest single risk factor for becoming HIV+ among US gay men, contributing 29% of the overall risk of becoming positive and 28% of the overall risk of being the receptive partner in anal sex. 

---

###Who gets HIV?

Anyone can get HIV if they have unprotected sex, but gay men are one of the highest risk groups. Women who have only ever had sex with women are at low risk.

HIV transmission rate during anal sex is estimated to be 18 times higher than the rate during vaginal intercourse, and many transmissions are passed on by people who aren't aware they are HIV+. 

According to Public Health England, around a quarter (27%) don't know they have the virus in that country. This is why its important to always **know your status**!

Generally, the receptive partner is at greater risk of contracting the HIV virus because the lining of the rectum is thin and may allow the virus to enter the body through semen exchange. 

The insertive partner is also at risk because STIs can enter through the urethra or through small cuts, abrasions, or open sores on the penis. Also, condoms are more likely to break during anal sex than during vaginal sex. Thus, even with a condom, anal sex can be risky.

Studies have found that risk factors for HIV infection are anal intercourse with a man in the past 12 months, having unstable housing, and having inhaled alkyl nitrites (“poppers”).

A 2009 study on the prevalence of unprotected anal intercourse among HIV-diagnosed MSM found that majority protected their partners during sexual activity, but a sizeable number of men continue to engage in sexual behaviors that place themselves and others at risk for HIV infections.

---

###Condom Fatigue

Although HIV transmission rates fell throughout the 1990s, they hit a plateau at the end of the decade. The increasing rates of sexually transmitted diseases in major cities in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom led to reports in the gay and mainstream media of condom fatigue and ""AIDS optimism"" as causes of the new ""laxness"" in safe sex practices.

This is supported by research on the tendency of couples (heterosexual or homosexual) to use condoms less over time.

A 2010 study found that gay and bisexual men choose to have unprotected sex for a variety of reasons and cannot be generalized. 

Erectile dysfunction, mental health problems and depression, lack of communication or intimacy, and a subculture of unprotected sex were all listed as reasons why men had sex without condoms voluntarily.

---

###How can I avoid getting HIV?

Using a condom during sex is the best way to avoid getting HIV, as well as other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Don't use an oil-based lubricant as it can damage the condom, making it more likely to split. Use a water-based lubricant, such as KY Jelly, instead.

**PrEP**

PrEP means Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis, and it’s the use of anti-HIV medication that keeps HIV negative people from becoming infected. PrEP is approved by the FDA and has been shown to be safe and effective. 

A single pill taken once daily, it is highly effective against HIV when taken every day. The medication interferes with HIV’s ability to copy itself in your body after you’ve been exposed. This prevents it from establishing an infection and making you sick.

Even though PrEP has been around in the U.S. for over a year, not a lot of people know about it. And, even fewer people feel like they know enough about it to be able to make an informed decision about whether or not to use it.

See this website for more info on PrEP:

http://www.whatisprep.org/

---

###When should I get a test?

If you're a gay man and you've had unprotected sex, it's important that you have a test. Public Health England recommends annual HIV testing for gay men who change sexual partners. Personally, I would say getting tested 6 months is even better to make sure that you always **know your status**! A large amount of new infections are a result of people not even knowing they are HIV+.

---

###Access To Testing 


A 2008 CDC study found that one in five (19%) of MSM in major U.S. cities were infected with HIV and almost half (44%) were unaware of their infection.

Many HIV-infected individuals do not seek treatment until late in their infection (an estimated 42% do not seek treatment until they begin to experience signs of illness.) Furthermore, a significant portion of individuals who are tested for HIV never return for their test results. 

Studies have advocated for funding and implementation of HIV tests that can be administered outside medical settings since 2003. 

Home testing is considered especially important because 8%-39% of partners tested in studies of partner counseling and referral services (PCRS) were found to have a previously undiagnosed HIV infection that their partner was unaware of.

In October 2012, OraQuick, the first rapid HIV home-testing kit, went on sale for $40. The test is nearly 100% accurate when it predicts HIV-negative results for HIV-negative individuals. 

However, for HIV-positive individuals that are not yet producing the antibodies detected by the test, it produces a false negative 93% of the time. 

Although the manufacturer is not advertising the test for use for selection of partners, experts have suggested that it may prevent unprotected sexual contact with partners that lie about or are unaware of their HIV status.

In the UK [home postal tests](https://www.tht.org.uk/sexual-health/About-HIV/HIV-postal-test) are available for free from the Terrance Higgins Trust.

###Dating Apps &amp; Online Dating

In Asia, according to a recent Unicef report, the epidemic is growing fastest in young gay and bisexual men. And one of the factors behind this trend is thought to be an increase in casual sex with multiple partners, driven by mobile dating apps. 

Wing-Sie Cheng, Unicef regional advisor for HIV and Aids in Bangkok, says she suspects many young men and women are being put at risk.

""It's not just one to one, it's one to many, so the risks of acquiring HIV go up.""

Although there is no evidence directly linking apps to HIV infection rates, their increasing prevalence means there is a ""need to sound alarm bells"", she adds.

Adolescence is traditionally a time when teenagers engage in risky behaviour and look to experiment and gain more independence.

The rise in ownership of smartphones and the popularity of social media has opened up opportunities for them to express themselves.

And that's prompted organisations like Unicef to start working with the companies running dating apps to help users act responsibly.

With more than one million active users across 192 countries, Grindr is the largest and probably the best-known gay platform. The app now encourages users to go for an HIV test and points them towards the nearest testing centre.

Parental consent is needed before a teenager can take an HIV test in many countries, with 11 in Asia including Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand.

Although this requirement is intended to protect under-18s, it also makes adolescents less likely to go for a test because they have to involve their parents.

Rather than being a useful protective measure, parental consent has become a barrier to testing and treatment, experts say.

So I’m a 25 y/o, recently out bro that has been seeing an awesome guy for about two weeks now. He’s older, has had several partners, and went through what he calls a “slutty phase” after he broke up with his ex last year. I recently asked him if we could get tested together before we had anal for the first time and he gladly obliged. We plan to go this weekend.

Here’s the catch: thanks to a lot of confusion before coming out, I’m still a virgin. I plan to tell him this eventually if and when we get more serious, but am not prepared to do so just yet. He knows I’m inexperienced when it comes to guys, but assumes I had sex with my past girlfriends. Frankly, I’m just embarrassed by my situation and only want to tell him after we know each other well.

My biggest worry is that the person administering the test will ask me a question in front of the SO that will expose this silly secret (“How many sexual partners have you had?”). I would hate for him to find out there. More generally, I just don’t know what to expect during the test (like, will we be in the same room together?), or if such questions will even be asked. Google searches don’t reveal much about the general process of getting tested.

We went on a dinner date, during which he explained that he was moving 500 miles away at the end of the week. There seemed to be a lot of chemistry between us and I felt unusually charmed by him. He asked if I wanted to hook up and I said yes, even though I almost never sleep with people I've just met. 

He had listed himself as HIV- on his profile, so I asked him if that information was up-to-date and he said yes. I tried to top him, but after a while my condom broke and I stopped. He was also bleeding a bit from being penetrated; the combination of these things killed the mood so I never finished. When I was using the bathroom before leaving I noticed a bottle of pills on a shelf above his toilet. I was curious about what they were but didn't think much of it and left. 

The next morning I remembered the name on the bottle and Googled it...it was HIV medication. I promptly called him and he picked up; I asked him about the pills and he admitted he was HIV positive. He said he was just diagnosed a few months ago and was ""nervous"" about telling me. He promptly hung up before I could ask any more questions and has not returned my calls since. I immediately went to the emergency room; the doctors prescribed Stribild to help prevent HIV infection. 

My roommate was visiting his family while this all transpired and returned on Monday. He is straight and we have only known each other for two months; we were randomly assigned to the same dorm/apartment at our university. I came out to him quickly and we have gotten along quite well up until this point. I was having trouble deciding if I wanted to tell him about this or not, but then I started getting really messy/hard to clean diarrhea as a side effect of Stribild and he asked me what was up. I decided to let him know about the situation yesterday.

I could tell that he was trying to be accepting but he was clearly very nervous and scared that he would somehow become infected. He said that he knew it could only be transmitted by blood/semen/breast milk but he was still extremely worried. He asked if I had been bleeding on anything and I told him I hadn't (I also added that I probably didn't get infected by this particular incident). Things have been awkward and tense. 

How can I help calm his nerves? What should I do about the situation?"

It was in the middle of Intercourse, we had been having sex for maybe 10 minutes at this point.  I believe he may have penetrated me once or twice before noticing.  

The thing is that I guess I don't trust him.  We won't be seeing each other this way again (or maybe in any way at all).  I'm really sad right now because of that, but also like I said I don't trust him and I worry that he may have been unsafe in the past. He had told me that he's been mainly with older men, some from South America. 

I'm just sad and worried now.  Sad that I cared for him and that it's over, and worried about potential HIV risk.  How long do I need to wait until getting tested will have accurate results?

Thanks for reading.


Update - went to the ER and was treated, blood was taken, they gave me a broad mix of antibiotics for general STD's and the first dose of PEP.  Need to follow up with my regular doctor for ongoing PEP treatment.  I am hoping and praying for the best outcome.  I am still scared, but in a better position due to the advice given here.  Thank you."

In February 2016 I had unprotected sex and I was the insertive partner (I topped) but it was only for a few minutes, no semen, and it wasn't hard   Under 5 minutes If that. 

I went to the doctor did a baseline test which was negative so that I could go on  PEP. Within 48 hours after exposure I took my first dose of PEP (around the 48 hour mark). 

I finished PEP on March, did the full 28 days. The other guy says he is negative and he did his last test on November-December 2015. 

After I finished PEP I did another test which was negative.  I had a flu (sinus and little bit sore throat plus felt tired but it wasn't on my bed can't move type of tired). It went away by the 2 week mark. 

Now it's been 5 weeks post PEP and just 2 days ago I noticed my left lymph node in my neck is a little bit inflamed although I did poke around with it so it could have made it worse. It's not huge, it's a small bit inflamed you can feel it versus the right side which feels normal. No pain whatsoever. 

I also developed a little bit pain under my armpit on my left side. It's not unbearable, it's just dull but goes away and comes back. 

Any suggestions? I have an appointment next week which will be 6 weeks post PEP to do a rapid test as well as a regular one. 

Is it weird that the doctor both times didn't call me to tell me I'm negative?  I'm in Canada. The first time he didn't call me for the baseline but on our next appointment after finishing PEP he would have told me if the baseline test came up positive. The second test after PEP he didnt call me either. 

Any ideas or possible infection? Thanks!!

Edit: this is my first time doing it unprotected it was the heat of the moment. I've never done it unprotected before and I've had one partner for 10 years. First time actually doing it with another guy.

It started with the story of Michael Johnson, who was sentenced to 30 years for the recklessly transmitting HIV without disclosure to one sexual partner and  recklessly exposing another to HIV without disclosure to four other sexual partners. That story was picked up in the news, and you can read about it on [*Buzzfeed*](http://www.buzzfeed.com/steventhrasher/how-college-wrestling-star-tiger-mandingo-became-an-hiv-scap) and the [*Saint Louis Post-Dispatch*](http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/ex-college-wrestler-gets-years-in-hiv-case-in-st/article_c3123243-b8d3-58c9-97df-e2c5a504902a.html).

It seems like the narrative about these laws is that they're draconian, don't do anything to limit HIV transmission and in fact increase it since people then choose not to get tested so they then can't say they didn't disclose their status. And on the one hand, I can see how that's a bad unintended consequence for people to just deliberately not know their status. But I also think people need to disclose that they're HIV to their sexual partners, even if they're undetectable and even if they're using condoms.

He'd always said he hardly had sex, and said the only guy he'd been involved with since me was a younger guy that he saw for a couple months that he was never able to have sex with at all. I thought at the time that he must've been being honest because it sounded sort of pathetic but he knows I kinda worry about std's and it was a pretty smart thing to tell me to get me to raw dog with him. Anyways this possibility should be eliminated by my likely getting an HIV test when I had a freak out and got PEP in an emergency room like a little over a month ago (this was for the encounter where the guy got tested so I ended uo only taking one dose btw) they took a bunch of blood samples so I'm like ""cool this is an HIV test"" but, I still haven't been billed for that fiasco or received any phone call from the hospital when I was supposed to get both, so I suspect that they somehow don't have contact information for me. anyways, I feel feverish, gettin cold sweats, diarrhea, headaches, and have been lethargic enough to have been in bed at least 18 of the 24 hours in a day for the past 3 days. wish me luck if you think i need it."

I went on several dates with a guy and on the last one he stayed over. He was great and up to that point we hadn't done anything more than kissing. The night was great and when we got to bed things got hot and heavy. We were just touching at this point. Nothing serious. I stopped for a moment and said ok we should have the talk. He said, what talk? I said I was STI negative. I had been tested the week before and had an NGU but had taken medication for it. He seemed confused and asked what STI was. I said it's just another way of saying STD. He said, no I don't have anything. We continued and I was really into it. Long story short I wound up putting my dick in his ass a few times ok...more than a few times.  I didn't cum though. We ended up just cuddling and about an hour later he is crying and I'm thinking maybe i did something that hurt him. After a few minutes of coaxing he tells me that ""what you said earlier, I'm not the same"". I said I didn't understand what he meant. In my head I'm freaking out but I don't want him to think I have an issue with his having HIV. My main problem is that he lied and I might have made some different choices as a result. I totally own that it was my choice not to put a condom on. I'm not trying to pass that responsibility off on him. I ask him why he didn't tell me about it when I asked. He said he was undetectable so he doesn't actually have HIV. I think he believes this is reason enough for not telling me. I'm not an idiot, I know that the risk of transmission is reduced when you're undetectable but do HIV+ men go around telling people they don't have anything just because they are undetectable? That seems strange to me. Anyway I tried to just push it out of my head and get some sleep.

In the morning I woke up and googled what to do. I knew there was something because years ago my friend was exposed during a fight at work and she went on some kind of medication. Google said I had 72 hours so I spent the morning with him and then later I went to an urgent care and got stated on PEP. Truvada and Isentress. I'm three weeks in, and the side effects are killing me but I haven't seen the most annoying one I'm experiencing online and I'm not sure if it's the medication or a sign of infection. I get the nausea and all. Even headaches and had some light sweating at night. That's not a huge deal but about a week into PEP my neck started feeling sore. I passed it off as that feeling you get when you've slept on your neck the wrong way. But it didn't go away. At the end of week two I was tested and negative. But my lymph nodes are clearly swollen in my neck and I'm sort of freaking out about it. I read that if I had symptoms like that my test would probably have been positive at this point but other things I've read say the PEP could mask it. They've been swollen for two weeks now and it's really uncomfortable. Fortunately no one can see them. It's just uncomfortable.

So is this normal? Should my lymph nodes be swollen at this point? I don't believe a word he said so I have no clue if he was really undetectable or not. Really freaked out about the swelling.

Also, did I do the right thing by not freaking out on this guy? I later wrote him a message saying I couldn't see him again. That I just wouldn't be able to trust him. I told him that had he told me the truth when I asked I would have simply done my research to make sure I did what I needed to protect myself. His HIV was not a deal breaker for me. He just didn't give me the choice."

I go to the ER. It's 10 PM at night. There are literally 25 people in the waiting room. It is packed with sick people waiting to be seen by the doctor. 

I wait there for 7 hours. it is now 6 AM. I finally get called in to be seen. I tell them my story and my concerns.

The doctor says to me: ""We don't do HIV tests in the ER. This is an emergency room for emergencies"". He does a quick exam and says he will give me a referral and then leaves the room.

I go to the nurse, ""wait, is that it?"" She goes, ""Yup, I'll get your discharge stuff ready.""

I AM PISSED!

What kind of care is this shit!?

They gave me a referral to this sexual health clinic, WHICH IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN. 

The triage nurse or whatever could have told me beforehand that they don't ""do"" HIV tests in the ER. What a load of crock anyways. What ER doesn't have HIV tests? This is discrimination!"

I'm not scared of HIV. In fact, I'm far more worried about herpes. HIV is not life threatening with modern medicine, once you're on meds, and have halted the progress of the virus, there is no spreading it unless either the virus mutates or you stop taking meds, and let's be real, if you're on the right cocktail, the odds of HIV becoming resistant to your particular drug cocktail today is effectively zero. This has been proven in a few meta-studies now that there has NEVER been a confirmed case of someone undetectable spreading the virus. 

In addition to this, HIV doesn't cause any painful symptoms such as herpes, which consequentially does not have a medicine to treat it as effectively as HIV.

Is it really that bad? Isn't it possible that some gay men would be scared enough to not seek treatment thus further spreading the infection?

I hooked up with a guy on the app that I barely knew. The next day I was going to go on over and hang out with him, and after some talking he disclosed to me that he was HIV+ but undetectable.

He said he takes medication for it daily, but really drove it home that I wasn't at risk with him. From what he says, I didn't bottom or top, and we didn't have any sexual contact that would put me at risk.

We have been hanging out and talking a really good amount, and part of me does believe him when he said that he didn't do anything to put me at risk.

The FBI also confirmed to Univision that it has met with him.

The man, who wore a disguise in his interview with Univision and was identified only as “Miguel,” said Mateen’s attack at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub was the result of a sexual encounter with two Latino men, one of which Mateen later discovered was HIV positive. The attack, carried out at the nightclub’s Latino night, was Mateen’s attempt at taking revenge against a specific community of gay men who he felt had used and rejected him, the man said.

So a guy I've been flirting with over the last couple of weeks came over last night. Was really psyched to meet him, played netball for the national men's team, was really attractive, studied sports science, had a good job, seemed like a really good catch. He came over last night and we had a pint each at a bar nearby and came back to my place. We had a bit of foreplay and there was a pretty tremendous spark. Anyway, to fast-forward a bit, the guy seemed very sex driven and less interested in conversation /  fraternising, which would normally be a turn-off for me, but I carried through with it anyway because he was super hot and generally pretty chilled out.

I recently had a chat with an HIV+ friend of mine, whom I consulted about HIV, and asked ""How do you ask someone if they're HIV+?"" He replied to me ""Ask them if they're negative or positive undetectable, they're more likely to tell you the truth and you'll seem (and are) an understanding guy"". I made a habit of this with every guy I sleep with.

So last night, just as we were clearly about to go for it, ""Are you negative or, HIV undetectable or...?"" and he gave me a very tentative ""Undetectable"" with far less confidence than he had for the rest of the night. That triggered some alarm bells, because of the way he said it - I can only imagine that he would have been taken aback to have the question as he hadn't told me whatsoever or even cautioned me (which I think is pretty shit, but I *can understand why*). Regardless, I threw on the condom as planned and proceeded to top him. I'm kinda inexperienced with sex so I'm not really sure if I have any reason to be slightly worried or not, but anyhoo, the condom seemed fine, after we were done we then just made out a fair bit, but beyond this (which I think is pretty low risk), there's one thing that has me thinking...

I have a history of hemorrhoids, sometimes really bad. They haven't been causing me issues recently, but can cause trouble for several weeks at a time, in the bathroom. He really enjoyed rimming, and so he was rimming me, mostly externally, but nonetheless that's probably the bit I was most worried about.

So, I'm here to ask for opinions and advice on three topics.
1. What do you make of the story and my reflections of this guy pertaining to possibility of HIV transmission
2. Are presently non-inflamed hemorrhoids a source for caution and risk when rimming?
3. Something struck me as odd about how he elected not to come out as HIV positive until I asked him just before penetration, and furthermore how he said it without confidence. He was very sex driven. Does this sound like someone who might not be taking their medications properly to achieve a very low viral load?

Sigh, head is swimming in this, all friendly candid replies are very well received. I can access PEP but should be going overseas to go hiking for a month, and the side effects of the high dose combo meds mightn't make me up to it, but that shouldn't be a consideration if there's any risk. All comments to help me navigate this situation very much appreciated."

A little more than a year ago I came out of the closet as bisexual and since then I have been seeing men. In a span of a year, I have slept with 30 men of all ages, however, one sticks out. His name is Paul and he's undetectable (very low viral load of HIV). I noticed him on an app and something about him immediately caught my eye. I messaged him on this app and we started talking. At first, he seemed like a very introverted character. Didn't answer with too much and just seemed a little distant. We kept talking and we agreed that we found each other very attractive. We set up a weekend to meet and he ended up bailing, it was strange as how days prior we were talking a lot (through the app) and he seemed fairly excited to meet me but on this day there was no word from him. A few days later. I messaged him asking him what happened the previous weekend and he responded with ignorance of not knowing we were meeting (seemed like complete bullshit). We continued talking and it occurred to me that we didn't have each other's numbers as we had been messaging each other through the app. I sent him my number and he seemed quite surprised I gave it to him, he soon started messaging my phone and we started talking to each other even more. A few days later, I decided to call him because I wanted to hear his voice. He picked up and we spoke for a good hour, at this point I really wanted to meet him. We agreed to meet once again the coming weekend and I was absolutely excited at the idea of meeting this man. Some days pass and I receive a very long message from him. He confessed to me that he had HIV and that he was sorry he didn't tell me before as he thought it would drive me away. I saw his honesty and I told him that I didn't care, because in truth, it didn't devalue him as a person, I had started to like him for who he was and him having HIV did not affect that. He was very surprised by my response and told me he liked me even more for being so straightforward about it. The weekend comes and I go to his house. The door opens and I see this 6 foot tall gorgeous man with a big beard, light eyes, muscular stature and possibly the sweetest glimmer I have ever seen in someone's eyes. We say hi and immediately being to kiss each other. We undress right at the doorway and have the hottest and greatest sex of my young life. We snuggled and talked and talked...and talked. He's a really sweet man. He's been through quite the ordeals. To give an example, he once had an ex who smuggled cocaine on a airplane without his knowledge while on a vacation trip.

 I like him, we go on dates, we hold hands, we cuddle every weekend and we talk everyday. He has a bit of a tough exterior due to this past but slowly he's opening up more and more to me. I want to date this man because he makes me happy and I make him happy. I know it's a quite the taboo relationship as he is quite older than me and he is also HIV+, but that doesn't matter to me. I want to hear your thoughts on this, my fellow gay brothers.

Yet these guys who disclose it are probably the best of the people who have HIV, there are probably guys I've talked to who don't disclose it but have it. But them disclosing it and doing the right thing gets them shut down.

We kissed and he tried to fuck me with a condom on, but couldn't get it in! And that was it.  And then there was anther guy a couple of days later who had a blister on the side of his lips or something like that? we didn't really kiss for long nor was I really into it. I fucked him with a condom on, and he tried an ass plug on me but with a condom on. And that was it really. Other than the riming and such.

So shortly after these encounter, I don't remember when exactly when, my throat became sore! I thought nothing of it! Except that it did not go away! After a 2 weeks I started to worry! And started researching HIV symptoms (both guys I had sex with looked healthy!) and having a sore throat is one of them!

So here I am, six weeks later, still have a sore throat and yesterday some red/white spots appeared on my tongue (a week before I had sex with another guy with him I made out for a really long time and he bit my lips). So today I went to my local STD clinic and showed the doctor my tounge and told him about my sore throat! He told that I should not worry and that this is not really what HIV symptoms look like~! He took a blood sample and a throat swap and results will be in a week, but I am still freaking out! I still believe I have HIV! I have never had a sore throat for 6 weeks before! And spots on my tongue, both are early symptoms of HIV :(

I am still young! I take care of my body! Work out and eat super healthy! This is not fair... Do I really have HIV?

I've been with my boyfriend for almost 3 years now. Starting this January (Whilst my boyfriend was serving compulsory military service) I started to suspect he was feeling differently about me - i wasn't really sure why, but there were signs such as not wanting sex as much as he used to, being distant and just a general difference in the way we spent time together. I started to suspect something was up. When i confronted him he said everything was fine and that i was thinking too much. One night when he was sleeping over i decided to check his phone and found he had a gay dating app called RECON which is basically a fetish dating app installed on his phone. I broke down instantly and woke him up from sleep; he started to comfort me and apologise. 

We talked about it for a day or so (he had to go back to the army so he wasn't available to talk a lot) and he promised that it was just curiosity and he had never acted upon it. I believed him (at least that's what i told myself). Move on another few months and I am feeling constant anxiety, depression etc has i feel he doesn't love me and I'm not worthy etc etc. around early May we decided to have penatrative sex, something i don't usually do as I am not a big fan but i figured it was something he wanted. I was top, and i decided not to use a condom. A week later I showed symptoms to what i believed was gonorrhea. I went to see my doctor and had a discussion with my boyfriend to say... I hadn't slept with anyone else outside of our relationship so it seems strange that i could possibly have a STI, again he promised me he didn't cheat. Diagnose comes back - sure enough it was gonorrhea. At the time i got my test he got tested also (including a blood test). 

One evening a week or so later, he calls me and says he want's to meet me after work. We meet up and he seems strange, after 5 minutes we stop in the street and he looks me in the eyes holding my hands and tells me he is HIV positive. My world fell apart. 

The next few months were hard, real hard (I tested negative at 7 weeks, I have yet to do 12 week test). I said I would stay with him and support him, but after 3 months it was too much, I said we need a break. After a week break i said we should break up. Fast forward two weeks, i miss him occasionally but in general I'm doing okay. We are still texting at this time and i notice he is distant which is hard to deal with, I call him and he says that he is angry, feels like i have abandoned him because of his HIV and that he had been mentally preparing for month knowing that my leaving him was inevitable thus the reason why he didn't really feel sad about the whole thing. I was heart broken that he could think of me in this way, and i regretted my decision. 

I basically begged him to take me back, and he said that he wasn't sure because these last few weeks he felt independent and that he could do whatever he liked. I cried a lot, and he cried too - but ultimatly he said we couldn't be together again. We say our goodbyes and I go home. An hour later he calls my friend (who was at my house) and asks how I am, she tells him I am sad and he goes on to tell her what he had just said to me. 10 minutes later he calls, and tells me we can give it another chance. 

That was 4 weeks ago and we have gone straight back in to our relationship and everything seems normal. But i still have those feelings that things are different. He is still secretive (putting passwrods on his messaging accounts) he went out with a friend and was obvious in not telling me who it was and just strange in general. Don't get me wrong, he is loving (in his way) and i know he cares about me and loves me but I am still finding it hard to trust him and part of that is it's very hard to share openly with him. 

What am I doing? I am a direct manager at a company overseas for over 60 people, every day i deal with leadership and making decisions but this anxiety (constantly waiting for his texts, waiting to see him and spend time with him looking for his ove seeking reassurance) is causing me to be depressed and affecting both my work and personal life. 

Just want people to give me their opinions, am I crazy?"

Since there was exposure without a condom, and he gave me something from me topping, do you think he has HIV as well? I mean you can't get an STD in your ass with a condom so he probably had bareback with someone else.

I've spent far too much time researching them.

That being said, I'm not immune to panicking at times :-\

Anyway, it's been a long time since I've done anything. Two nights ago (approx 44 hours ago), I met up with a long-term friend of mine. We ended up kissing. We didn't do anything other than kissing. There was some tongue involved, but it wasn't the most intense or prolonged kissing I've ever done.

Later that night, when I got home, I bit into a piece of bread. As I looked down, I saw that there was some pink on the bread. I looked in the mirror and saw my lower gum (in between teeth) was bleeding a tiny bit. 

Now, I don't know if it started bleeding during kissing or after, but I did panic a bit. I asked (again) for his HIV status, which he assured me was negative and that he gets regularly tested. I have known this guy and his family for years and he is really not a very promiscuous person, and definitely not a liar).

I did my research (that I had already done anyway) and was assured by all reputable sources that HIV cannot be transmitted by kissing, because a) HIV is not present in saliva, b) saliva damages the HIV virus even if present in other substances, and c) it is basically impossible to get it in a tiny bleeding gum. I also asked my friends who are doctors (one in infectious diseases), and they told me to stop wasting their time. Given that HIV transmission is also basically impossible to transmit even through oral sex, I understand that I am probably overreacting way too much.

I had a date the next night, and I ended up kissing this guy too (btw, kissing two people over two nights comes after a period of not kissing anybody for two full years, so I am quite out of my comfort zone). I didn't find any blood after that kiss, but I was still paranoid that a tiny cut may have been present in my mouth.

I guess my question is - considering I still have another 28 hours or so to consider PEP, am I totally overreacting? I've been told that I will be refused PEP for this situation, but is there any chance I should try and find someone who would give me it? 

Please try to be serious and not condescending in your responses if possible - I'm only writing here because I'm panicked. I do suffer from anxiety and have been doing counselling for years, but I still have my moments of weakness. "

I'm going to cut to the chase. I have a cold sore, left side, lower line of my bottom lip. It's going on day 3 and I've been taking valacyclovir 1000mgs twice a day since Monday along with Releve drops. There's really no crusting and two very tiny tiny... Scabs I guess? If you were looking at me, other than the area being slightly more pink, you wouldn't be able to point out I have a breakout. 

Now, I hung out with someone today and by the end of the night, we kissed, briefly. It was light kisses, only lips touching and two with open lips and one moment I felt his tongue but I'm not into French so I quickly pulled away before that turned to a full on open mouthed kiss which we did not do. In total we kissed less than 10 times. Also I told him I had a breakout, which he didn't care. Should have been a red flag. 

Anyway, I had to leave but I had a boner so I had asked him his status for when we should hang out again and he told me he was **Positive**. I feel horrible, because he was very sweet but I wish I had known that earlier on. 

What are the chances that I could have possibly contracted HIV from those kisses with him? I'm also on PrEP too. I tested Negative just last Friday so I know my status up until this point. Would you advise I go to the hospital and see about taking PEP for the next 4 weeks? 

I'm definitely freaking out and I know the risks with kissing is small, but I know having Herpes makes you 3 times more likely to contract HIV through breaks in the skin. But if we weren't full on making out or there was hardly any saliva involved (he did lick his lips) should I worry? Please help me out. I'm probably overreacting, but I really need to know if I should seek out help or not. 

Thank you! 

**TL;DR** Lightly kissed someone who was HIV Positive and I have a healing cold sore on my lip. Please advise.

Edit: I do want to apologize for not educating myself enough about HIV and for offending anyone who might be positive or otherwise. Ignorance affects everyone, so I am really sorry. "

I'm seeking advice from this sub regarding a recent risky encounter I had with another guy. 

Downloaded grindr a month ago because I moved to a rural community from my previous college town, was hoping to meet some new guys and possibly have some safe fun.

We both discussed that we were HIV- and did have anal sex for a good amount of time that night (I was the top, and we didn't share ejaculate). The next day he messages me on Grindr and tells me he is HIV+ undetectable for two years now. I went into my local ER to get PEP and no one knows what it is, they never offered it to me, and told me it was my responsibility to find a pharmacy that carries these ARTs. I have spent the last 3 days trying to find a pharmacy and everyone told me it would be special ordered by Tuesday. I feel terrible, defeated, and have done the research that my chance is most likely low but I am still quite upset and scared. I feel sexually assaulted if that is even the correct terminology and the guy who did this to me is no longer replying to my messages. Trying to get myself in order to see a infectious disease doctor to follow me through some of these testing and possibly get me started on PrEP. 

Does anyone have any advice in the future? Or any statistics not from the CDC or personal experiences they can share to help educate me, make me feel a little more confident or help me through this? "

Im talking like saying Neutral, like HIV Neutral. This way you're not negative so you are infected, but you're not infectious, like someone we associate to being just positive. It comes off easier to say and type. And i think itll be easier to teach the populace about being truly undetectable with a new word than trying to tack it on to something which has such a negative connotation.

Also, i feel like it could provide a medical category much like how AIDS is when your immune system has been properly thrashed by the virus. It gives those who are responsible a sign they can prove if necessary much like guys who are negative.

Throwaway here. My bf of 1 year has tested positive and I'm extremely concerned. I love him and will continue to support him but this has been a pretty traumatic experience. I'm a total top, and we used condoms probably for the first 7ish months because I wasn't sure if he was keeping it exclusive, but I came to love and trust him so we threw them to the wind. He still claims he's only been with me since our inception and I believe him. Regardless, I've tested negative 2 weeks since our last bout of unprotected sex. This is clearly a good sign, but of course is far from conclusive. I'm obviously very concerned about the unprotected sex aspect, but there's other exposures that worry me.

He has fairly bad acne, and I've kissed, rubbed my freshly shaved face on, touched, and even popped some pimples that he's had. He also frequently gets nosebleeds from various things I won't go into. I've touched and thrown out those tissues many times before, and am concerned I maybe picked my nose or rubbed my eyes after.

I understand the virus dies almost immediately upon touching air, I understand it's more difficult for tops to get, and I understand there have been many cases like this involving longer periods of unprotected sex with the negative partner remains negative, but the trauma from this experience has left me with a lot of what ifs. If anyone has had a similar experience, involving exposure to blood/acne/unprotected sex, where one partner remained negative, I could really use your positive (no pun intended) vibes.

I love you all and thank you in advance for any and all answers."

My concern is that he was getting high, clearly hooks up a lot and apparently enjoys bareback. I'd say he was a high risk of being hiv+ - particularly as he suggested I go on PEP after he barebacks, to me this suggests he knows he is positive.  

We used protection but I gave him oral without a condom. 

The reason I'm concerned is that a week later I have a cough and feeling a bit tired - some of the early signs. 

Am I over reacting? Obviously I will get tested, both asap and after 3 months but this is starting to play on my mind a lot."

A topic like this has probably been posted many times before, but I need a little bit of reassurance.

I had my first hookup (and first time having sex) yesterday. We only had non-penetrative sex (mostly mutual masturbation, frotting, kissing, just horsing around), a little bit of fingering (really ''undeep/shallow'') and he gave my a BJ.  

I noticed, in the shower after the sex, that my penis had a little scratch with just a little bit of blood. So now I'm wondering whether it is, in theory, possible to pass HIV to someone through semen on your hands (handjob after ejaculation or via anal masturbation). I'm pretty sure that we were pretty much done after the orgasm, but I don't remember it exactly and it would be good to know for future endeavours.

CDC states that:
&gt;HIV does not survive long outside the human body (such as on surfaces), and it cannot reproduce outside a human host.

This is still a bit vague. Does anyone have an idea how I should interpret this? 

It's certainly something I'd do again, but I'm a control freak so I'm trying to find an optimal pleasure to risk ratio.

For this question, the hypothetical guys are assumed to be **proven** undetectable status AND on their daily medicine regimens, skipping no days. We're not talking about guys who lie about their viral status or unwilling (or unable?) to take medication. Or even the odd guy who is HIV negative (or unsure) and is saying he is HIV+ undetectable, for some reason (yes, I have encountered this type of guy before).

EDIT: Also, the hypothetical guy is disclosing it to you, ahead of time. No ""surprises"" later.

HIV+ undetectable means the person is HIV+ but, because of their medicine (usually prescribed by Gilead, the same company who makes Truvada/PrEP), their viral load is statistically close to zero. In ""real world"" measures, it's ""virtually"" like being HIV negative.

But since they are already positive, and medicated, their strain is controlled. They can't pass it on to you, even if he bareback topped you while you were loopy on tina and E and NOT on PrEP. The CDC has no recorded cases of someone who is HIV+ undetectable passing it on to another person.

So the questions...

* Would you date an HIV+ undetectable guy?
* Would you have protected sex with them?
* Would you (or have you) had unprotected sex with a HIV+ undetectable guy, knowing that he can't actually infect you (disregarding other STDs in this hypothetical)?
* Would you have unprotected sex with a guy who said he was negative, but not with someone who admitted they were HIV+ and undetectable?
* Would you only have sex with them if you were the top and he the bottom, knowing the chances of infections are magnitudes lower for the top?
* Would you be uncomfortable with them no matter what, because you still fear the HIV?
* General other opinions on the subject

(As a background, I'd be interested to know if you live in a big/urban metro or a smaller/subruban/rural environment)

Original Post...

I want to say thanks self.gaybros
Submitted 12 minutes ago by LilJay1988
As a newly hiv infected gay male I have been increasingly worried that no one would ever want to be with me again. All things considered (28, educated, in college to become a social worker, hard worker, have all my own things, sexy, intelligent, funny and have a heart of gold) I see myself as favorable, however with this diagnoses, which was my greatest fear, has now been realised it has tarnished the image I have of myself. I want to say thank you to everyone who has posted honest and genuine comments on this post and to know that I actually think I have a chance to get married and have kids, one of my greatest wishes. I currently live in a very conservative southeastern US state and the bigotry and misinformation of being gay, much less HIV positive nearly weighs me down. I will be moving to a more diverse and friendly city in about 5 years when I finish my masters. I just don't know where to move yet. Oh and if anyone would be kind enough to walk me through reddit (I occasionally read posts , but I'm a brand new user (this is my first post) that would be much appreciated.

EDIT. (09/25/16)  While not intending to misinform I am also undetectable which I forgot to disclose in the original post. Seeing the comments about segregating myself from the population, however justified in those fears of those responding, cued me to throw that tidbit out there. I concur with the consensus among hiv educators, professionals, and leading research indicating that those who have reached undetectable are at negligible risk of transmitting the virus. (I'll be happy to source this when  I get to a desktop later today)

Telling a new partner would be one of the most difficult thing to do but I would do that before anything physical. Out of respect, I would allow them to walk away from any pursuit of a relationship. I would educate them if they ask and they could take all the time they need. To be frank I could masterbate to achieve an orgasm so I'm interested in a person from the outset (not one to party and fuck my way around town) (to each there own, no judgment, just have to have a connection to have sex)

 For how I got the virus, I trusted the person i was in a 7 year monogamous relationship with. We both tested negative twice in the beginning and I tested negative before entering the relationship. Unprotected sex led me here and I have had a total of 5 partners my entire life. Now I clearly understand the weight of my mistakes and I very much paid with my life. I had projected 3 years to live at the time of my diagnoses. Needless to say it felt like my world fell apart. I'm single now (not related to the virus as to why the breakup happen) and I'm in the process of sewing up all my wounds. I'm on a track to become the healthiest version of myself. I'm working to lose weight that I gained from the enormous amount of stress. The breakup. And the diagnoses. 

Quesrions? Feel free to comment. To those who posted, thank you and see the above edit. "
54xlmb,Concerned Grindr hookup gave me HIV,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/54xlmb/concerned_grindr_hookup_gave_me_hiv/,sideprofile1,0,9/28/2016 10:47,12,/r/askgaybros/comments/54xlmb/concerned_grindr_hookup_gave_me_hiv/,NaN,"Hello,

This morning I had got oral sex from a man. After a few minutes he started inserting his fingers inside my anus (using saliva as lube) and was being pretty rough. After a while he pressed his penis against my anus and I think the tip might've gone inside a little bit. I pushed him away and his penis made contact for about 1 second. After it was over, I noticed that there was feces that came out during this. I then noticed that he did cause some bleeding. 

I'm worried I could've gotten infected. This was a hookup so I have no history of him prior to this. I tried talking to him about it but after being blocked a few times, he finally told me that he is negative and gets tested every other month. I don't know if I should believe him because he took about 3 tries to finally tell me he gets tested every other month. Should I get on PeP? I don't have health insurance which is why I'm a little hesitant. Thank you for the help. I really appreciate it. 

Also, I know this may not be the best place to ask this question, but I don't know where else to. We don't have a family doctor and I can't find anywhere else to submit this question to. If you do know of a better place, I'd be very thankful if you'd let me know. "

So one of my friends in particular is actually from the same city as me. (San Diego). Anyways we were talking about guys we've come across on Grindr and such and the topic of this one guy came up. (Let't call him Bob). Bob is the only guy I have had unprotected sex with ever. (I topped him). Apparently I later learned that Bob is/was a meth dealer and he had an ex-boyfriend that tested HIV+. (That doesn't necessarily mean he is I guess, but I'm still very concerned by that fact.) Bob is a 40+ year old guy who I suspect/have heard sleeps with A LOT of men. Young men in particular. Anyways I have scheduled an HIV test (Among other STI's) for a few days down the line and that's all I can seem to think about. This sexual encounter I had with Bob was around mid July. I have not felt any different since that sexual encounter but I am also aware that only about 75% of people who contract HIV feel the flu-like symptoms early on. Bob claimed at the time that he was negative and on Prep. I'm not sure I believe that but it could also be true I guess.

Anyways, Am I panicking too much? I haven't been able to sleep and I probably won't be able to until I get my test results back and it says negative. I know there is nothing I can really do about it at this point other than get tested and hope for the best, but I can't help but just panic."

During the in-between time he got a boyfriend, who he later found out was shooting heroin. He told me the guy was a neat freak and that after confronting him about his drug use the guy assured him that he was a clean needle user only and that there was nothing to worry about. Of course my FWB got tested immediately and was negative (this was July...they had gotten tested together in Feb too and were both negative, which is when they started barebacking), but he's still waiting to take his final test in a couple of weeks to make sure that he didn't catch anything during that time.

I decided that since my FWB and I always use condoms, it was safe enough to go ahead and play. Of course, as I was topping him I had a condom break for the first time in my life (I almost never top so I didn't realize until after we had finished), and now I'm freaked out that I could become infected through the chain.

I know that the odds of contracting HIV as a top are low, and I know that statistically, given the negative tests my FWB has already done, there's a strong chance he's still HIV negative -- meaning I couldn't contract it from him. Would it be worth it to see a doctor about PEP, or am I over-reacting to this? I'm not sure if these factors make it more or less likely I'm ""high risk."" "

So my last HIV test was a little under three months ago and it came back negative. I had engaged in some low risk activity within the window period before the test and in the weeks since then, but nothing I thought I had to stress too much over.

A few weeks after my last test, I experienced an intense amount of bug bites which obviously resulted in itch and rash. Only I noticed that after nearly a month, the itchiness and rash on my feet wasn't going away. It's now been almost two months and I'm still experiencing redness, itchiness, and a dry rash on both of my feet. I'm itchy in other places sometimes but not enough to be really noteworthy, and the rash is only on my feet. 

I'm not one to panic over symptoms, but should I be worried? I plan to get retested ASAP just to get an answer and hopefully put my mind at some ease, but is there anyone who can give me any advice on the experience in the meantime? Am I panicking for nothing? Help!"

&gt;A second man taking the daily HIV-prevention pill Truvada has been infected by a rare drug-resistant strain of the virus.
The results were presented by Cleveland Clinic HIV specialist Howard Grossman, who unveiled the finding at the 2016 HIV Research for Prevention conference in Chicago on Tuesday.
The patient, who is not releasing his name or age to protect his privacy, is a gay man who had been taking the drug daily since January 2016. Hair and blood tests confirmed that he had the appropriate blood levels of the pill’s two drugs — tenofovir and emtricitabine — to offer the nearly 99% protection it offers from the virus when taken daily.

&gt;The patient’s long-term partner is HIV-positive but on treatment, with an undetectable viral load in his body. On two occasions and with two separate people, however, the couple had condomless sex with a third person.

&gt;Grossman found that the patient’s strain of HIV was resistant to both of the drugs in Truvada, as well as all of the other drugs in its class, which work by blocking one of the enzymes needed by the virus to reproduce. The new strain did not match his partner’s, meaning that the multi-drug-resistant virus must have been transmitted during one of the two sexual encounters.

&gt;The man, who is now HIV-positive, is on a mixture of antiretroviral drugs and has his infection under control, Grossman said.
&gt;The first documented case of a person on daily Truvada being infected with the virus was announced in February. For now, experts suggest that the cases should not be cause for alarm.
“We know PrEP is not 100% effective, and that’s something we need to be saying loudly and clearly,” Mitchell Warren, executive director of AVAC, a global HIV-prevention advocacy group in New York City, told BuzzFeed News. “No prevention method — other than abstinence — is.”
&gt;But while the risk exists, it needs to be weighed against the pill’s well-demonstrated benefits, Warren said. “We have now seen hundreds of thousands of people on oral PrEP, and we’ve only seen two cases of so-called breakthrough infections.”
&gt;Instead, Warren urged that we need better surveillance to track and identify the prevalence of drug-resistant strains of the virus. “This is a virus that’s been around for 35 years — it’s so variable and mutates so rapidly — and that’s one of the biggest challenges for developing any prevention.”
&gt;Grossman agreed that the new case should not cause those taking or considering taking PrEP to reconsider using the drug out of fear.
&gt;“Truthfully, PrEP is the best intervention we’ve ever had to prevent HIV,” he said. “I don’t think we’re going to see some huge explosion of failures. I think it’s going to be a sort of trickle, if anything.”

After having sex with one of them a week later or so I started developing 'symptoms' of HIV and rushed my self to be checked for HIV but ofcourse the test showed negative because only after 3-6 months of infection can the test give the proper results and those 6 months was the most depressing time of my life because I was convinced I had HIV and I was only 19 at that time and still had so much to achieve and thank god the results showed that I was negative ... Flash forward to today a year after those 6 months I still haven't had sex with anyone because I do not want to go through that ordeal again... 
               I have changed my outlook on life since then and honestly sex doesn't even mean that much to me anymore , I think I seek for a relationship more and as weird as it sounds it also a way of keep myself from getting infected by STD's because I would know my partner personally and it beats having sex with random people you meet over Grindr...I don't know if its just me being paranoid or not but what do you guys think ?

Trump and the GOP will soon have control over all 3 branches of government - The White House, both houses of Congress, and the Supreme Court. One of the most notable goals of both the GOP and Donald Trump is to eliminate the Affordable Care Act (ACA) (""Obamacare"") and to defund / eliminate Planned Parenthood. With nearly no checks and balances on him or his party, Donald Trump will have the power to achieve these goals.

Let's discuss: What are the public health implications on our community?

Many gay men rely on public services like Planned Parenthood for subsidized sexual health testing and care.

With Obamacare gone, there will no-longer be consumer protection against pre-existing conditions discrimination. Could gays be discriminated by the health care industry?  Could HIV-positive gay men lose their current health care? Will we now lose PrEP?

Could the anti-gay goals of such an administration lead to a gay public health crisis and a nationwide [HIV outbreak like we saw in Indiana under then Governor Mike Pence](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-pence-indiana-hiv_us_57f53b9be4b002a7312022ef)?'

I've been a reader here for quite a while now. This is quite long but please, take time to read.

It was May this year when I started to use Grindr. I was on a vacation at that time and I was thinking to myself, ""I need to be able to give and receive a blowjob nefore going home"". Note that I was still a virgin and never had any experience with man-to-man /activities/. 

It was 2AM and I started talking to this guy and decided to meet each other up by the shoreline. We see each other and we said our hi's. My hands were sweating profusely and my heart was beating faster than Mayweather running away from Pacquiao. Anyway, we then proceeded to perform oral sex on each other. He initiated it first. He ejaculated in my mouth. After that, I was so disgusted and worried for myself. I asked him if he was safe from any viruses or infections and he said yes. He's a law student so I was pretty confidnet that he'd be honest in answering my question.

Three days later I had a canker/cold sore inside my mouth. I was scared shitless. Questions were popping inside my head; ""What if I contracted herpes or worse, HIV?"". I was pretty sure it was herpes though. I went to a doctor for consultation and gave me meds to treat the HSV. Canker sore disappeared in a few days and I was back to my normal non-paranoid state.

Mid-June, I had a fever for 3 or 4 days. I developed rashes on my arm. I remember thinking, ""This is it. I must've been infected with HIV."" I went to the doctor and it was just UTI. There was a huge amount of pus found in my pee but I highly doubt it was an infection I caught from that oral sex though. After taking antibiotics for about a week, I got well.

I was still scared at that point so I decided to go to our city clinic. It was my frist time and I can't express how much fear I  felt at that time. I was very worried to get a reactive result. Anyhow, I went inside the clinic and they inerviewed me and so on and so forth. They withdrew blood from me. I waited for about 10 or 15 mins and it came back non reactive. It was pure bliss 💃💃💃

Fast forward to October 23, 2016. I opened up my Grindr and this guy was interested in seeing me so I agreed. He said he was 26 and an engineer and it is going to be his first time meeting up with a guy or doing a /thing with a guy, basically. It was around 11PM when we met each other. Again, I was so nervous but I tried to hide it just like Kylie Jenner trying to hide her plastic surgeries. He held my hand and I started rubbing his crotch. I sucked him and after a few moments he asked if he could fuck me. If course I sad no! My ass wasn't prepared and he hadn't bought a condom with him. I don't know why but I agreed eventually. It was SO FUCKING PAINFUL, my dear Lord. So we fucked in his car and I sad to him don't cum inside and but did otherwise. What a fucking moron. I can tell that it was his first time though because he knew nothing about gay sex, literally. 

Here's my dilemma, I'm worried that he might be lying about me being his first. I'm scared that I /might have gotten infected by him. I don't know what to do. I want to approach him and just ask him to take the test with me but I dont know if it's the right thing to do. I want to hear your opinions and suggestions, gaybros. Thanks!

I am 19 and I recently started seeing another guy my age.  It started as just a hookup but there was chemistry and he ended up staying over.  We ended up hanging out for the next three days, met all of his friends even his parents (which is interesting because no other guys has ever shown me to his parents).  On Sunday, we were in bed cuddling and he told me that he had something to tell me and I would probably never want to see him again after I knew what it was.  He then admitted that he was HIV+.  My first thought was if he was okay and he was going to die soon or anything.  I didn't even think about us having sex.  He asked if I still wanted to be with him and I said ""This doesn't change anything"".  He told me everything about how he thought he got it, that he had an undetectable viral load and how he takes medicine and that they expect him to live a normal life.  We both had to go back to school that night so I had leave him.  I thought about it a lot and I want to give him a chance and I would want to be with him.  The fact that he has HIV doesn't change how I feel about him.  Admittedly, I am worried that some day down the road I may get HIV from him.  I was hoping there were some others that might be able to educate me on what I should do in this situation.  I have made an appointment to see a doctor about PREP and to get an HIV test (though I tested negative last month).  I really want to be with him and we get along so well.  I was hoping there were some others in a mixed status relationship that could provide some advice or maybe ease my fears about contracting HIV from him.  Thanks.

tl;dr What precautions should I take in a mixed status relationship where I am the HIV negative partner?

With that being said, I made a huge mistake. About 1 week ago, I bottomed for someone on Grindr without a condom. I was prepared with two of them, however I was moderately intoxicated and this important step somehow slipped my mind. I'm nearly 100% sure that he didn't cum inside me, and I texted him to ask again what his status was and when he was last checked. He insisted that he was negative for everything and was tested last month.

Here's my issue: if he actually did test negative for HIV 1 month ago, who's to say that he's not in the window where it doesn't show up on the test. From what I understand, this is one of the riskiest times for transmission. Add that to the fact that I had a hemorrhoid at the time, and that leaves me even more at risk for the virus to enter. This worries me because he seems to be very active on grindr, and since he didn't even ask about a condom with me, I can only assume that he's having unprotected sex with many people. I do not believe he is on PrEP either.

I did not get PEP due to various reasons, so that option is no longer available to me. Luckily, I have someone close to me who is willing to pay for a PCR RNA test so that I'm able to know as soon as possible, rather than waiting the 3 months for an antibody screen.

So after all of this being said, I'm wondering what my actual risk of contracting the virus would be. Let's assume the worst and say that he doesn't know that he's positive yet and has a high viral load. Should I be as anxious as I am now? I know only the test can give me an answer (as well as a 3 month follow up) but I would appreciate some insight if anyone has any."

I don't even know where to start, so I'll just explain the background of my current situation. 

I (24) have been in a 3 year relationship with my boyfriend (27). I can honestly say that I love him to death and can see spending my life with him, we even have plans to move in together next year.

Anyway, about a year and a half ago we stopped having sex. At first he told me that he wanted to stop because of his religious beliefs, telling me that he felt a deep regret and guilt after sex. Being honest, sex wasn't that big of a deal to me at that time, I obviously enjoyed it, but my sex-drive has always been low that I didn't really mind, so we kept dating minus the sex.

Forward to this morning, we had a serious conversation about our future and planning how next year would be for us. During the conversation he told me he had another serious thing to tell me. As you might tell by the title, he told me that he was HIV+. He explained to me that the reason he wanted us to stop having sex was that, him being afraid of infecting me, and that he didn't tell me because he was afraid that I would leave him because of it.

It was a long and emotional conversation, but we got through it. I still loving him, nothing has changed and we are still together. He's been medicating and everything is under control. However he agreed that I should go get tested.

My questions are the following:

1. It's been over a year and a half since the last time that we had sex and that he was diagnosed with HIV. He did show some symptoms last year, getting really sick for a couple months (he told me it was another disease). I, however, haven't had any symptom since, at least not that I'm aware of, I feel completely healthy. I'll still go get checked, but does the fact that I haven't showed any symptom could mean that I'm negative?

2. I'm aware he still feels some fear about us having sex, so far we've only jerked off together. I want to wait for him to feel comfortable enough and try sex again (obviously with protection and I plan on getting on PrEP afte getting my test results). Any advice on how to aproach on this?

3. Any advice regarding having a relationship with a HIV+ boyfriend will be greatly appreciated, as well as any useful info you can give me."

And I just read about new forms of gonorrhea (or maybe it was syphilis?) that are becoming immune to treatments. 

I don't judge anyone for contracting an STD or HIV, but more often than not people CAN prevent them simply by using a condom and now getting Prep for HIV prevention. But many guys will get prep and stop using condoms altogether and it's only making things worse with these new strains of STDs that are immune/resistant to treatment. Why don't people just use condoms?? I mostly top and I don't even notice a difference. It also costs a lot of money in tax dollars every year here in the U.S.

On sunday (4th) late evening I had unprotected sex with a guy - he was a top and I was a bottom. Circumstances:

1. We didnt use condom and lube... (He rimmed me before and I didnt feel pain)
2. He didnt cum in me.
3. He was uncut and had tight foreskin.
4. He s 31 and I am 20 if that matters.

I asked him and he said he tested himself last time at the beginning of 2016 and he had unprotected sex a lot since that time. Im fucking terrified right now. Its been 5 days and Im alreayd feeling sick. I dont have cold or fever and im not sweating but Im feeling tired like i have no energy at all and my shoulder hurt I dont know what to do. Im getting paranoid. I went to the clinic few days ago with my friend but it was pointless to get tested as there has to be 4 week window after exposure before you can detect hiv. 

So I told that guy to get tested and he has appointment on monday... How long do you wait for results?

What are the odds.... Please tell me the truth I am freaking out right now, and im feeling worse (mentally) every day. This will be longest 4 weeks of my life. If Ill get HIV for christmas I will  literally kill myself :("

I do not know how to proceed trying to figure out if I do in fact have an HIV as I am 16 years old and asking my parents to take me to get tested will absolutely not end well especially since it's most likely paranoia.

However, since then, I am really starting to wonder if he's telling the full story. Especially since everyone else at work thinks he is on drugs. Is losing 50 pounds in 2 months and acting like you are a hard drug user a thing when you begin HIV treatment?

He has already proven himself to be a serial liar. I think it’s a tricky space for HR because they are aware of the medical situation and are giving him leeway. But on the other hand, he is literally doing nothing…nothing on the job. And getting paid to do it. 

What do I do? And if it is drugs, anybody have ideas on how I can help him help himself?

it might seem silly because i use condoms. but i just can't help stressing over whether his hands we clean- of sperm- when he put it on, or whether it was torn during sex.  
i've only hooked up with 4 guys so far. and i stress out every single time.
last time i took meds for all kinds of STIs afterwards because i got the flu afterwards. it freaked me out.
the one before that i got tested for HIV 30 days after. 
this time i know myself better to know that my anxiety can get out of hand, so i know not to freak out. but you can't deny the fact that there is always a risk when hooking up with someone, and even with condom use there is always a chance of getting infected. even more so for bottoms, and then again for gay men in general. 
i'm a med student so it makes it worse, because i know how bad it is out there. 
i just want to know how you guys deal with it? do you think about it often? do you ask the person you're about to hook up with about their HIV status even though they might lie or it might turn people off. and if so how and when? 
what do you think guys? 
PS: we dont get prep in my country and even if we did i dont hook up often enough to justify the use.  "

I asked him when he last got tested and he told me it was September and the results were negative. He also told me he didn't remember the last time he had unprotected sex was.  I ended up leaving pissed off. I messaged him asking when he was getting tested next and he hasn't responded.

I'm thinking about going to the hospital and asking for PEP. It costs like 1,500 here which I don't exactly have! I do have insurance through work.  I'm just wondering if anyone can give me any resources that could possibly lead me into the right direction or get access to this medication at a lesser cost or free?

I'm just worried I may have come into contact with it. He just seems very weird. I also am getting over a bit of a cold so I for some reason think this will increase my chances.

2 weeks ago I had a drunken night and had unprotected sex with a guy who told me after the fact he was HIV+, but was undetectable. He confirmed this the next day when I texted him stressed out. I was the top. I've never had unprotected sex with a stranger before, I'm always really cautious, but I don't know what happened that night. 

Anyway, I went to the bathroom and noticed on the tip of my cock was a small scratch with some dried blood around it. I went straight to the ER and got a prescription of PEP (first course around 5 hours after sex). After all this I didn't have a chance to shower or anything for the next 24 hours due to work, and I'm uncircumcised.

I'm 2 weeks into the 28 day schedule and am having some nausea and sleeplessness (probably more due to stress than the medications), but nothing too severe so far. 

I guess my question is how much risk do I have here? Is the fact I couldn't properly wash for 24 hours a big deal at all? I didn't bottom, but as is the way with sex it can always get messy, what if his cum got into the cut on my penis? It's tearing me up atm that I might have made an awful mistake I'll regret for the rest of my life.

Though my homosexuality is acknowledge and accepted, there is still an overwhelming amount of ignorance about it not only in my family, but as I see, in the whole society. The last straw was when my mom casually asked me and my boyfriend in public if we have AIDS (was she really that awkwardly ignorant!?!). I really got furious and almost confronted them (we were in a very public place- a restaurant). I told them ""HIV/ AIDS is not a Gay-only Disease"". I was really embarrassed for my boyfriend (I can't believe he left San Diego for this shit drama). 

I'm really really sad right now about my friend. I'm blaming a lot of things. Like the educational system constantly getting interfered by stupid Filipino Catholic clergies who have a medieval mindset who always make safe sex education big deal in schools. Just because you are celibate, does not mean we have to be celibate too, you fucking losers! And also the politicians who cowardly succumbed to clergy power. Well guess what! There is no such thing as a Catholic vote, imbeciles!

I also learned that my friend already knew 3 years ago that he was positive and hid it from his family. He did not seek treatment and the virus progressed like a wildfire throughout the years. That was the time when we spent a ""born-again"" retreat together. I remembered there was an anti-gay/ homo talk at the retreat. That memory really gets in to me since his brother came out too at that time. I wish he told me and we could have gotten advice from Research Institute of Tropical Medicine. I heard ARV are provided free-of-charge. Is there any chance to prolong his life? or improve the quality of life? I'm still yet to see him this week. :(

There's so a lot in my mind right now. Sorry for the rant and sadness dudes.

The long and short of it is that almost a year ago I found out I was HIV positive after my near monthly full panel test (not one to hookup but it's the same cost either way) came back with a positive on syphilis and a positive hiv test with an unconfirmed western blot. At this point there was a chance it was a false + but considering what happened a month prior I knew. I didn't tell anyone at the time (I'm out) but I was raped by a guy who now I know is a consistent liar and has gotten in trouble with the law in the past. I didn't get medical help for PEP because it was too expensive and I didn't have the money. looking back it was a dumb as fuck decision to not use the other means I had necessary to get the medication but I was in a shitty place mentally before the assault and that only made things worse.

It's been a year since then and I've stayed undetectable since the 6th week on medication and have only forgot to take it once. I filed a police report of what happened and I haven't heard of any developments for a while. I think I will try to reach out again soon since there's a rapist who's lying about their status running around but if they haven't found anything (which is surprising considering I have the guys address) I just want to be done with it. 

Honestly my only physical problems seem to be dealing with some chronic GI issues that are exacerbated by both my ART and antidepressants but I'm seeing a specialist for that soon and I've found a temporary solution. It's caused some weight loss but now I get to pig out and eat whatever so it's not that bad hehe.

 Mentally/socially is another challenge. When I found out I deleted grindr after I screenshot my convo with the rapist, and only got back on after my tests came back undetectable and I was back at college. I deleted the app again because it was an emotional drain to have to deal with the constant rejection after disclosing my status and having to answer question after question and get insulted. Maybe it's just my local community but it feels like I'm going to be in a long term relationship with my sex toys at this point so whenever I think about that it gets me down. Not so much since I've deleted the app but seeing friends dating and the recentish Valentine's day I was definitely alittle salty.

I honestly don't know why I'm posting this, and considering the last block of text you might not think things are going well but I've been feeling pretty good lately despite that and I guess I just wanted to chronicle my own situation to show it gets better, but that there are still challenges. I'm still not completely open about my status given the reaction I've had so far but I hope one day I'll be able to take my own advice and just give less of a fuck what other people think and live my life better than what I'm doing now.

Edit: I'm so thankful for all the replies guys. I'm having a great day so far but I know if I'm ever feeling down about my status I can look through here  and feel alittle better. Seriously, I'm humbled, I'm working on school stuff but will get to replying to as many as I can get to. A minor boon is I have a lot of feelings I can channel into my art (minor) haha. "

During some self-incite, I questioned myself why I avoid guys with HIV - and the reason isn't because i have a fear of the Virus (well I do have a healthy desire to not get it). 
BUT its because of my assumption that most HIV is contracted through Anal sex, and as 'side'/a guy not interested in anal sex - i just assume that HIV = into anal sex.

There's also the assumption/stereotype that bottoms are more likely to contract HIV than tops/ you usually contract it through receptive anal sex. 

So I realised I stereotype HIV+ guys as bottoms and then translate that as being not sexually compatible with me! Thats kinda my red flag. 

I'd be totally up for dating a HIV+ 'side' guy - that's not because of not wanting risky sex.... but thats just my sexual role/preference. 

Its also the case that as soon as you learn someone is HIV+ you instantly want to know 'how did you get it' - which I release isn't a very nice way to be thinking!

I just felt so anxious to do it again because I am a hypochondriac. I believe I will most likely go to the clinic this Wednesday to get a rapid test because my thoughts have been consuming me for over two years. 

Has someone ever been in my situation? I'm shaking right now. Too anxious :( "

And now I'm literally terrified at this point. I feel like it's just a lot of things in my once. The movie brought me back to a lot of painful homophobic things my parents have said to me about AIDS, plus the fact that being a gay black male in the DC area means odds are 1 in 2 that I'll get HIV - statistically speaking. (Or so I've heard - I'm not sure of the exact numbers.) And all of this completely freaked me out because I'm in college and a virgin in every sense of the word and I've just reached a point in life where I feel comfortable enough to explore my sexuality with other guys, I've been wanting to have my first hookup, etc.

I don't know what anxiety really feels like but since yesterday I've just been completely out of my mind. I've been on the verge of crying and could barely get through discussing the movie in class. I feel like sex is dirty (even though the logical side of me KNOWS it's not, even though I've always had a sex-positive mindset in general) and I feel so dirty for wanting to explore sex. And I know I shouldn't feel like this, but I keep thinking about all the homophobic words I've gotten about HIV/AIDS and I just feel like I can't dismiss it as ignorant homophobia because it's all true - it's a fact that millions of gay people died from this (more so than straight people) and it's a very real thing. But I've always known that. I know people today are living full lives with HIV, and I try to educate myself on HIV risks and safe(r) sex. And that's why it scares me so much that I can't even tell my friends what's going on with me without crying. I literally don't know why this is affecting me like this.

I feel like this is about more than just the movie, and maybe it's just stirring up all the other unresolved shit in my mind, but I don't know what to do because I've never been a person who has unstable emotions. My friend really helped me calm myself down last night and she's been supportive, but I need to hear from other gay guys. I know it's hard to help somebody who doesn't even know what's wrong with themselves, but how do you guys deal with things like this?"

In the past few years I’ve dated a couple guys for longer or shorter periods but they never worked out due to lack of mutual interest, but I never cared much. I finally found this guy that I am as attracted to as I’ve ever been to anyone. I’m 29, he’s 27. Although I don’t know him too well yet (we have been talking online for a few months and went on a date only once a few days ago) I find him beautiful inside and out and would love to know him better. He happens to be hiv+ (with very low viral load due to treatment) which I really don’t see as an obstacle we couldn’t work out. I’ve made all of this very clear to him too.

Thing is, he’s been + for many years and he told me he has not had sex in 5 years (he says very few people are willing to date him because of being poz) and he really craves to be loved and cared for, which I’d be more than happy to be given the chance to do. I’d really like this to work out but not sure what direction we’re headed because I’m getting mixed signals.

Some signs tell me we are on the right track: When we chat, we have good conversations. Our date was a total success, clearly we liked each other a lot – it was going to be a short walk which turned into a long walk ending up in my apartment (but there was no sex). Shortly after the date he called me to say how handsome I am and how good it was to be hugged. 

On the other hand, there are signs telling me the opposite: Sometimes he disappears for a days, not responding to my messages, he keeps ignoring my questions about when we can meet again, he keeps asking me why I am so interested in him, why I don’t have a boyfriend etc. like he couldn’t fathom it. He brings up his ex and that the way it ended still hurts him.

So I’m getting these mixed signals and not sure what to make of it. Any thoughts?

I just took an Oraquick home hiv test. Long story short, the instructions say that if there is only one line by the letter ""C"" the test is negative. If there is a line the ""C"" and the ""T"", ""even a faint one,"" the test is positive. They show a picture of a faint, but pretty visible line by the T and a dark line by the C.


My results showed a normal line (not as dark as the booklet) by the C and an **extremely** faint line by the T. By ""extremely,"" I mean I can only barely see it if I hold the test to the light or really close to my face, I am not exaggerating.


Anybody else experience this or is an expert? Before you say it, I plan to get another test at a clinic, but I need to more about what is happening, because now I'm confused. Mainly I need to know what the instructions mean by ""faint line"" and if it's possible that what I'm seeing is just the T line ""in the background"" that is supposed to show up if positive or if what I have is considered a faint line. Also, what does a faint line mean in terms of infection? I know a ""faint"" line means positive, but *why* is it faint as opposed to darker? Does that mean it's an early detection and if so, should I wait before I get tested again? My last sexual encounter was a few weeks ago, protected, but prior to that it was more than a year since I got a test, but always protected. Or does a faint line mean ""less sure"" or ""less conclusive"" than a darker one?"

Basically, I took an Oraquick HIV test at home and the results showed a VERY VERY faint line next to the T. The instructions say that any line there,'even a faint one', is a positive result, but this line was so faint you could barely see it without holding the stick to the light, so I was unsure, and I always wore condoms.



I went to a clinic to get a rapid finger prick blood test and the result was negative. So I guess the line I saw was the line pre-drawn in the back of the test for a positive outcome, but I'm not sure. Just sharing in case others experience the same thing. Check the stick first to see if you can see a faint line and then see if it's different after you take the test. "

I am 20 year bottom old and I have hard time coping with the probability of being infected by HIV. So here is my analysis:

* According to CDC 20% of gay men are HIV positive. (Let us define p=20%)
* According to Wikipedia the probability of contracting HIV whilst bare bottoming is between 0.4% and 3%. I'll take a conservative 0.7%. (q=0.7%)
* According to Wikipedia condom use decreases the probability of contracting HIV on average by 80%. (c=20%)
* Assuming that on the average (best (!) case scenario) I have sex once a month until I am 50, I'll have 360 encounters. If I have sex twice a month (worst (!) case scenario) I'll have 720 encounters. (n=360 or n=720)

The probability that I'll contract HIV at least one in *n* encounters is then given by:

1- ( (1-p) + p* (1- c*q ))^n

1- [(prob. the guy doesn't have HIV *OR* (He has HIV *AND* I get infected by HIV whilst using condom))^n]

The expression in [] is the probability that I don't get HIV in *n* encounters and thus 1- of that is the probability that I get HIV in at least one of the encounters. Now some numbers

best case scenario: 9.6%
worst case scenario: 18.2%

So in the best case scenario I'll get HIV with a probability of 10% and worst case with almost 20%! (I also calculated with PreP and as it turns out it reduces the probability greatly 0.8% with *n=360* and 1.5% with *n*=720 but currently I cannot afford it)

tl;dr There is a 9.6% chance of contracting HIV if you use condoms and have sex only once in a month (18.2% twice a month) for 30 years.

Edit: I know shitty title. I wrote \r at the beginning for some obscure reason!

Edit 2: If I factor in people under treatment (~50%) and assume that they have negligible transmission probability I end up with  4.9% best case and 9.5% worst case scenario. "

So I met this guy who was perfect for me, and we were just together and I was already really horny and he knew how to touch me the right way. But he was so reluctant to go back with me, and then he told me that he was HIV undetectable. It didn't really bother me since we were just heavily petting and kissing each other. But I was wondering, how far can I go with him? I'm not on PrEP, and I don't do anal at all (I just don't like it), so the furthest we will go is probably oral. Can I just go home with him, kiss a lot, handjobs, and oral and still stay safe? I don't want to turn him down jsut because he's positive, but at the same time, I can't be on PrEP right now (family issues etc. too long of a story). Also, I don't plan anything long term, just a hook up is all I want from him (we both went into it knowing this), but he's just so hot and our chemistry is perfect.

I was scared though he did mention initially that he had no disease. But of course he can say whatever he wants to. We then continued sex with a new condom. 

After he has cum, I went to the washroom and squeeze out my bum. There was some blood. After that incident, I asked him on the app for some details. He took the last hiv test in November 2016 and was negative. His last causal sex was 2 weeks ago. He said that he pulled out immediately when the condom broke. 

I checked the website and says that this is considered unprotected anal sex. I am worried about precum inside when the condom broke. Also he may have other partners though he stated that he only do safe sex. And he prefers to have a relationship as stated in his profile. He mostly top. 

So should I be worried to take PEP or just wait for the HIV test after one month?

First off, this is an x-post from a medical advice subreddit, hence the formal writing. :)

I'm 19, not very experienced, and had sex with another guy (same age) last night. It consisted of mutual masterbation, unprotected oral sex (receptive and giving), and, while no penetrative anal sex, several attempts were made with a condom where I was the penetrative partner. At one point, the head of my penis may have briefly been inside, but since we were trying very determinedly to get it in and his anus was tight, there is a very slim possibility the condom may have broken. I was unable to check in detail afterwards if this did occur, but it seemed intact for the split second I glimpsed at it when I took it off. Later, my penis sans condom did rub up against the outside of his anus several times.

I would normally not be too concerned, but after sex I found a sore just below the glans penis, on the underside, near the frenulum, most likely from an injury during masterbating earlier that morning or the previous day. I'm not sure if it bled during any of the sexual acts, but it is about 4mm in diameter. At the time I discovered it after intercourse, it was not bleeding, but it was a deeper red than the surrounding skin and slightly wet to the touch (I think with a clear fluid and not blood, but I can't be definitively sure). It was very comparable to what I would expect skin to look like if a scab was ripped off too early, which may have been the case. Today, it is no longer wet nor a different color than the surrounding skin, but there is a clear 3mm scabbed line where the skin was fused together over the opening, which hurts as if it could separate when the surrounding skin is stretched.

(Although my primary concern is about the sore, I should also mention that as this was relatively unplanned, I did brush my teeth about 45 minutes before I first gave oral sex, which I know raises the risk of HIV transmission. While he did not ejaculate in my mouth, there was a fair amount of clear pre-ejaculate during the act).

The partner claimed to have been tested negative for HIV a month ago, but I know him to be a fairly promiscuous person, and it's likely that he has been with several partners since then. He claims to usually use a condom for penetrative anal sex.

Given the presence of the sore as well as unprotected oral sex, a rough attempt at protected anal sex, and later possible exposure of the sore to the outside of his anus, what are my chances of being exposed to HIV? Should I seek Post-Exposure Prophylaxis? Any advice would help this slightly scared teenager be a little less afraid!

Thanks!"

This section stood out: 

&gt;Most scientists now believe that risk of contracting H.I.V. boils down to a numbers game rather than a blame game: If the virus is not present in your sexual network, you can have unprotected sex and not get infected. But if you are in a community, like Jackson, where a high percentage of gay and bisexual men are infected with H.I.V. — and many don’t know it and go untreated — any unprotected sexual encounter becomes a potential time bomb. *This explanation of “viral load” helps dispel the stubbornly held notion that gay and bisexual black men have more sex than other men, a false perception embedded in the American sexual imagination and fueled by stereotypes of black men as hypersexual Mandingos dating back to slavery.*
“Black men are not just out here having unprotected sex willy-nilly; the science disproves that,” said Terrance Moore, deputy executive director of the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors in Washington. *He pointed to stacks of studies over the years, including a groundbreaking, exhaustive 2006 data dive led by Greg Millett that was published in The American Journal of Public Health. In this and other studies, Millett and his colleagues found that gay black men engage in risky sexual practices no more frequently, are as consistent about condom use and have fewer sex partners than their nonblack peers.* “It’s that the viral load in communities of black gay men is higher, which puts them at disproportionate risk,” Moore explained. “Plus, these are the same individuals that are dealing with structural barriers around lack of employment, lack of education and opportunities, transportation and, of course, very, very overt institutional racism.”

I do not doubt that high viral loads play a role in the HIV epidemic, or that this contributes to the higher percentages in HIV rates among black Men Who Have Sex With Men (MSMs), regardless of their self-identity.  The same is almost certainly true across racial groups, and not all or even most sexual networks are racially homogeneous.  Caucasian partners with high viral loads are more likely to transmit the virus to their partners, regardless of race, just as black partners with low or undetectable viral loads are less likely to transmit the virus to their partners, regardless of race.  You can substitute the race or ethnicity of the partner and that does not change.  This is nothing new, and that is one of the reasons regular testing and early treatment are encouraged alongside preventive measures like reduction of partners, reduction of alcohol and drug use before sexual encounters, condoms, PreP, and PEP.  

But as I posted in a comment reply over at /r/gaybros, my major objection to this is ""the science disproves that,"" a claim that is not challenged in an article that blames viral loads and lack of resources as well as institutional racism for the high HIV rates among black MSMs.  First of all, the cited article's abstract states that ""high rates of HIV infection for Black MSM were *partly attributable to a high prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases that facilitate HIV transmission* and to undetected or late diagnosis of HIV infection.""  Both the NY Times article and the man citing studies do not mention this finding.  It also does not mention that the quoted article is a literature of previous studies.  Nor does anyone question the reliance on a single literature review conducted in 2006 using data from surveys that are much older.
 

Even worse, the article does it mention that 2 of the 5 studies that had surveys of sexual behavior in the first decade of the AIDS epidemic *did* show differences in unprotected anal intercourse when comparing blacks to whites.  Other studies had different results, some showing that there was lower prevalence of unprotected sex.  The cited paper does not have the survey numbers for individual studies apart from noting that collectively the study evaluated 4000 MSM and the SF area study evaluated 250 black MSM, and that one found that 52% reported unprotected anal intercourse and that was higher than for white MSM in the same time period.  Of the studies published since 1992, one was discounted entirely because it did not differentiate between unprotected vaginal sex and unprotected anal sex, although that study found that black MSMs were more likely to have unprotected sex than white MSMs.  Discounting an entire study of MSMs because the survey did not distinguish between unprotected anal sex and unprotected vaginal sex is puzzling; although the probability of transmission of HIV in the latter case is much lower than the former, the fact that unprotected intercourse is taking place is of course relevant in any discussion of HIV transmission and risks among different populations.  

For the [latter study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2594963/), which was published in 2004, this is what was reported: 

&gt;African-American gay/bisexual men (n=12) were significantly more likely than white gay/bisexual men (n=32) to report unprotected vaginal/anal sex in the past six months (67% versus 22%, p&lt;0.01), **since diagnosis (42% versus 9%, p&lt;0.05), and to report a history of intravenous drug use (50% versus 3%, p&lt;0.01)**, but did not differ from heterosexual African-American men (n=15).

Again, these are MSMs reporting unprotected sex *after diagnosis*, which significantly increases the risk of transmission.  Yet the study is discounted because it does not differentiate between vaginal and anal intercourse, even though the population being studied has already been identified as an MSM population.  


Now the sample sizes of that survey are very small, but this leads to another issue: The surveys are all based on self-reporting.  There are many reasons why self-reporting in this area is not particularly reliable.  But we do have some reason to believe that this is a much bigger problem for black MSMs than white MSMs, at least during the relevant time periods: The studies analyzed in the 2006 literature review *overwhelmingly* demonstrate that black MSMs are far less likely to identify as gay or associate with gay culture/media/groups, and less likely to disclose their identity or behavior to close friends or casual acquaintances. 

But because only 3 studies that were considered for the literature review tested for associations between disclosure of sexual identity and HIV risk behavior, there was very limited data on that point.  One study published in 1992 with survey data from 1990 ""found that Black MSM who were uncomfortable disclosing their sexuality to others were more likely than Black MSM who were “out” to engage in unsafe sex.""  According to the literature review cited by the New York Times, [a 2002 study found the opposite](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12476265), but the abstract of that article states that ""results indicate that AAGBM who possess more positive (i.e., integrated) self-identification as being African American and gay reported higher levels of self-esteem, HIV prevention self-efficacy, stronger social support networks, greater levels of life satisfaction, and lower levels of male gender role and psychological distress than their counterparts who reported less positive (i.e., less well integrated) African American and gay identity development.""  Given this discrepancy between the meta analysis and the abstract, which is all that is available publicly, we can set aside this 2002 study as supporting what the meta analysis claims for now.  The [final study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12588004) on this point, a survey of data from 1994 to 2000, distinguished between young MSM who do not disclose their sexual orientation (nondisclosers) and those who do (disclosers).  Several limitations apply to this study, first and foremost that it only evaluated young MSM 15-22, not MSM from every age category, and indicated that overall (not broken down by race) ""8% of 637 nondisclosers were infected with HIV compared with 11% of 4,952 disclosers."" Among blacks, ""the prevalence of HJV infection was 14% among 199 nondisclosers compared with 24% among 910 disclosers.""  But importantly, [this data was survey data collected](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5021a4.htm) in gay venues or, as the CDC puts it, ""public venues where young MSM congregate (e.g., urban shopping blocks, dance clubs, bars, and young gay organizations).""  All participants agreed to test anonymously for HIV.  There is no reason to conclude that this study is particularly representative, particularly for nondisclosers since we can safely assume that there will be nondisclosers who are not comfortable frequenting those venues in the first place. 

Not only did the study find that HIV prevalence was higher among blacks than whites, which any study will, but also that HIV prevalence *increased with age.*  Again, these age-based differences could be important causal factors when there is established and uncontroversial association with nondisclosure of sexuality and behavior and older age, at least for MSMs.  There was also a much higher HIV incidence rate (% who tested positive per year) for MSMs who identified as heterosexual, even though there was not a single recent positive HIV test result for those who reported only sex with women in the last 6 months By contrast, there was a 2.4% incident rate for those who reported only sex with men and a 4.3% incident rate for those who reported sex with both men and women. 

Taking all of the above into account, does the **2006 literature review** really stand for the proposition that ""the science disproves""  there are differences in sexual behavior based on race and sexuality identity disclosure? Absolutely not, and it is incredibly irresponsible to suggest otherwise, particularly when the ""science"" is self-reporting by willing participants and much of the data that supports the alternative conclusion is disregarded, downplayed and, in at least one case, potentially misreported.  

I have no doubt that the other factors cited in the article play a role, but it seems to me that the article and the quote want to present a narrative that isn't supported by the very data that they are citing.  And that's unfortunate.  Not only is that approach a bad strategy for addressing the risks facing MSMs of all racial groups, it also undermines public confidence in reporting on these issues when exposed, and feeds into a conspiratorial belief that large media outlets promote an ideological social justice narrative at the expense of accuracy.

I went to my doctor this morning and am waiting for the results from my first test.  I just keep freaking out during the day. Like i'll be totally fine and then all of a sudden I have this pit of dread in my stomach and feel sick and like i'm suffocating. We only had oral sex (He did cum in my mouth and I swallowed right away) so I know that the chances of transmission are low but I can't help but feel that the test is going to come back positive. I'm trying to keep myself busy but its a real struggle. I'm angry, scared, sad, melancholy and I don't even think its because I might have HIV. I really hope i'm not positive but the not knowing is killing me. I don't really feel like talking or being around anyone and I'm also scared cause I just started seeing a guy and i'm not sure how or when to tell him.

Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago is doing an online research assessing the experiences and attitudes of young Latino men who have sex with men and trans* Latinas when it comes to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a once a day pill that helps prevent HIV. The goal of this study is to understand and improve PrEP access in Latinx communities. 

You will be compensated $30 in the form of a money order if you complete the survey, and you will have the opportunity to earn an additional $20 if you refer two eligible friends to the study.

Here are the details:

**WHAT IS VOCES LATINX?**

Voces Latinx: The Chicago PrEP Opinions Survey is an online survey study that we think can help improve PrEP access for Latinx MSM and trans* Latinas here in Chicago. Participants are asked to share their thoughts about PrEP and also experiences with health care providers. The study is run by psychologist, Dr. Marco Hidalgo, and funded by Emory University’s Center for AIDS Research (CFAR).

**WHAT WILL STUDY PARTICIPANTS BE ASKED TO DO?**

It’s a 25-30 minute online questionnaire surveying their attitudes about HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). They will also be asked about their experiences with healthcare providers. We’re collecting this information because we think it can help improve PrEP access in Latinx communities here in Chicago.

**IN WHAT LANGUAGES IS THE SURVEY AVAILABLE?**

The survey is available in both English and Spanish.

**WILL RESPONDENTS BE PAID FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION?**

Yes, up to $50. Here’s how: Participants will be compensated $30 cash if they complete the survey, and they will have the opportunity to earn an additional $20 if someone they referred also completes the survey.

**HOW MANY RESPONDENTS ARE NEEDED FOR THIS STUDY AND BY WHEN?**

We're looking to enroll 100 participants by July 31, 2017!

Long story short, my BF of six years has been diagnosed hiv+ last Monday - today's Wednesday. 

For now it appears that i'm negative but to put it slightly this is tough one.

He's obviously devastated... we haven't seen any counsellor or anything yet and he hasn't received his full results with blood counts and all that.

I guess i'm looking for advice on how to support him the best. 
For now i've been doing my best to keep him upbeat and re-assuring him and keeping him busy. But it makes me look a bit like i don't realise what the situation is. 

Anticipating questions, we're both 30, have sex with other guys mostly together but sometimes not and always used protection then, we think he got it from a guys in a sauna.

Any advice? 

Edit: i just want to say thank you to all who've commented. I've been a lurker for years and always saw these people saying how great of a community reddit is. Well it's fucking true, you guys are the best! Of course there is that one weirdo but hey... who fucking cares?! 

My partner is starting to feel better, he saw a counsellor today and the guy repeated a lot of the things you've told me. Again, I really appreciate all the support. I will come back and update. It's the beginning of a tough few weeks but we will be fine! :)"

About 3 weeks to a month ago, I met a guy on Grindr and had sex with him. I was topping. I used a condom, except he kept asking me to cum in him, so I took it off for about 2 minutes at the end to cum in him (stupid, I know, but I was horny and not thinking straight). After I did, he leaned down and sucked me off for about another minute or so before we stopped. He said he was clean. 


Now, some background. I have had fever blisters since I was a little kid, and about once a year, sometimes twice a year I get a HUGE fever blister that I put acyclovir cream on. Well, a couple of days ago I had an outbreak and I got one medium sized one on my upper and lower lip. Now I have a sore throat and am sneezing. The time period of this is what's worrying me, being about 3 weeks to a month after. 


Another possible scenario I am considering is that since I have had a VERY stressful two months due to family issues and maybe some mild depression, that's what's causing my fever blister and sickness. 


However, I am scared to death. I am still on my parents insurance, and I am not out, and could never be out without getting disowned by my entire family (live in the Bible belt.) So the possibility of having to both come out as bisexual and having HIV is terrifying me to the point that I can barely eat.

Condoms are much more effective at preventing transmission of HIV, they don't work very well for preventing herpes (as it's transmitted via skin to skin contact), and unlike herpes, HIV is very hard to transmit orally.

Also if you are HIV+ you can take the medication, become ""undetectable"" in viral load and assure your partner that the chances of transmission even without protection is negligible. Herpes antivirals on the other hand only slightly decrease the transmission rate (I heard about 50%), you can never have ""undetectable"" herpes.

So therefore isn't it harder to get someone to stay with you after disclosing you're HSV2+ than HIV+, as it's so much more catching?"

It didn't hurt. He didn't cum inside me, and I didn't cum either. I'm still terrified he's lying and that I should go to the emergency room and get on PEP.

I feel stupid, actually I AM stupid for going through with it despite knowing better. I feel scared. He was only 21, I'm 19 (gay virgin until now) so we're both younger, if that's any consolation. 

If I do visit the ER, will this be confidential? Can I keep this from my parents? Will my insurance cover the cost of PEP? I've heard it's up to around $3000. I'm close to Seattle and I know there are resources here that are helpful.

However, I can't help to feel paranoid with every little rash or slightly sore throat that I have been infected with HIV no matter how safe I've been. I feel more fatigued since but that may be attributed to stress at work or just lack of proper sleep. Apart from that, I have displayed no other symptoms common to the acute infection stage, but some people infected do not display any symptoms at all anyway. I know that I've used condoms but there is still always a chance of condom breaking etc. Even so, the chances of HIV transmission are still pretty low. 

I will wait until the correct window period after my last hookup to get tested, but in the meantime, am I being worried for nothing? Am I really at risk?

I know of this gay doctor with hiv who had to be hospitalized. This gay doctor refused to be hospitalized where his clinic is, since he didn't want anyone from his hospital to know his hiv status. Thus, he went to a hospital far from where his clinic is located. When he was hospitalized, a straight male doctor was doing rounds. When the straight male doctor entered his hospital room, the gay doctor asked the straight male doctor to be discreet about his hiv status. 

The hateful, straight male doctor yelled ""Pa discreet ka dyan? Tignan mo nangyari sa yo."" which translates to ""You're acting discreet? Look at what happened to u."" The gay doctor didn't say anything.

This is the kind of hatred and stigmatization that oppressed filipinos and filipinas with hiv must be subjected to regularly. If this happens between medical professionals, then how much worse is it then for those who don't have medical backgrounds? Contrast this to what another filipino gay guy that I know of who moved to san francisco ""worries"" about. The filipino gay immigrant uses truvada/prep since he desires pleasurable, unprotected sex. That is what he is concerned with. I suppose he doesn't even fear getting hiv or any stds since he never uses condoms. That is what san fran and other american city gay guys ""worry"" about. They worry about having more pleasurable sex.

Gay guys living in l.a.'s weho, chicago, seattle, miami, ny city, brooklyn, and sanfran must not have to go thru the hatred that gay guys of manila with hiv go thru. I'd think that if this was done to anyone gay from those american cities, it would be the hateful, straight doctor who'd be stigmatized. He'd probably have to conceal his hatred. 

Anyone have any suggestions how to help that gay doctor with hiv?"

I like this guy A LOT and truly see immense potential in a future relationship with him. I really like him.

But tonight he kissed me extremely hard, bitting, etc and the front tip of my upper lip bled A LOT. Not a tiny bit, like I took kleenex and basically bled through it. It's still stinging quite a bit. _It is absolutely an open wound._

I am HIV- as of a few months ago when I was last tested because it was a fad friends of mine were into (getting us all tested at once). And have NOT been sexually active (or relationship wise either).

While so far I trust this guy and we already talked about if we are both clean (yes I know, too soon. Too soon I know.. I'm a noob!) I am not sure if this is an acceptable level of risk.

He had no sores/cuts on his mouth / lips / gums I could see (yes I sadly did look -_-). It was only me who was bleeding profusely.

So am I at risk of HIV? I am so paranoid right now I am crying. I really like this guy so much but I do NOT WANT HIV!  I am too young to make a mistake and ruin the rest of my life.


I heard of HAART and some ""emergency HAART"" treatment I can take to eliminate any chance of me getting HIV if I start it like TONIGHT by going to the hospital.

Should I be doing this?

Please tell me if this is a risk I should be looking into. I am not sure if I should go to the hospital or what right now."

&gt;He believes that HIV resistance is due to the fact that more people receive remedies in the world and they do not have adequate follow-up treatment. ""It's partly due to good reasons, but a backside is that in some patients the virus is resistant to the commonly used emergency medication, and then medication does not work properly,"" says Jan Albert

&gt;HIV drug resistance develops when people do not adhere to a prescribed treatment plan, often because they do not have consistent access to quality HIV treatment and care. Individuals with HIV drug resistance will start to fail therapy and may also transmit drug-resistant viruses to others.

Everyone knows its a bigger risk to get hiv if you are gay, and especially because there are so many bisexual guys with girlfriends,  who cheats and secretly fucks other guys and are stupid enough to not use protection.

If you have HIV you have a responsibility to tell EVERY sexpartner, even random hookups that you have it. 
I would not have sex with an hiv-positive guy, and that is not mean, rude, discriminating or evil for me not wanting to. It is 4 % likely that you will get infected.

So far, I've had sex with 6 guys, topped 3 of them(always used a condom) and got oral from the other 3 (never bottomed). Nothing too risky that would make me believe I contracted HIV. However, about three weeks ago (June 19th) I received head from a guy; After the encounter I started to get an itching sensation on my penis. Freaking out, I went to the doctor for an STD test (June 28th) to see if I contracted something (turns out soap just slipped in my urethra). While there I was tested for HIV (which came back negative). During the week that I was waiting for my test results, I was a mess (anxiety that I have caught something). When the test results came in, I tested negative for everything (including HIV).While talking to my doctor about the results, we started to get into the details of my results and how valid they were (given the short turn around time). I told him that I was fearful that I might have HIV (normal reaction with my first STD testing; always thinking of the worst), he told me that I tested negative but since it takes two- six weeks for HIV to show in my blood the test may be invalid. Ever since then, I've been researching on symptoms of HIV and I am slowly started to see them (loss of appetite, headaches, sore throat, lack of focus).    
    
    
I am assuming due to my anxiety, my body is making me sick with these symptoms. I am also thinking that these symptoms may be because of a potential head concussion I had a week ago.

As the title says, this question joins many others in asking about HIV. I usually find my answers by reading other posts, but I couldn't find any with my situation. After many, many months of lurking, here's my first throwaway account to ask you lovely folks about my situation.

Let's get to it. I had unprotected sex (shocker I know). I tried to get the guy to use a condom, but he refused, saying he ""only wanted to put it in to see how it felt"" and that he ""wasn't going to cum inside me."" Which he didn't, but still, he was inside me. His profile said he was negative and on Prep, but I know not to trust that. I could have stopped him, but I am terrible at standing up for myself or being assertive when I have to be, so I let it continue. I admit my mistake, and it was a big one.

Within a 48 hour period, I got on PEP. I couldn't afford both Truvada and Isentress, so I got Combivir instead. It was a sucky month, with side effects and all that. I finished the prescription, missing one dose (I was supposed to take 2 of each pill a day, but I forgot to do it the second time one day around the first week of the prescription, and I also dropped one of the Combivir pills and lost it). Now I'm waiting until I have enough money to get a test.

I want to do the early detection RNA test (https://www.stdcheck.com/hiv-rna-test.php ) but it's very expensive. I don't want to wait for the regular, cheaper test because I'm having pretty bad anxiety right now. So I guess my question is should I really be as concerned as I am? I did as much as I could regarding taking PEP and all that, but I know it's not 100%, and I'm trying to convince myself that the guy was honest in his profile. I know that's wishful thinking, but it's all I can think to do. Am I being rational? And if I do test positive, I shudder thinking about it, what are some ways I can cope with it?

Lastly, I've made a deal with myself that if I am lucky and test negative, I'll become celibate, at least until I find an actual relationship. It may sound silly, but this anxiety is ridiculous and as long as I struggle to stand up for myself, I can't see me kicking someone out if they don't want to use a condom when I ask them to. Hooking up is fun, but I don't think it's safe for me."

I was freaking out and my mind immediately jumped to HIV so I looked up as much info as possible on it. One of the primary symptoms is a very bad case of the flu/strep throat for about a 2 week period and then it virtually becomes symptomless for a long time. I had the worst flu/strep throat of my life for 2 weeks in June so I was convinced that the symptoms matched and I had contracted HIV. I was up all night thinking of how I would tell my family and friends the news and reading up about HIV treatment (which thankfully has progressed significantly over the past few decades). 

The letter told me to visit a city clinic immediately so I did today. Luckily it was completely free and they told me I had an interaction with someone who had syphilis who had given them my name and phone number. I never thought I'd be so relieved to think I might have syphilis. After a brief wait they called my number and led me into a room with a cute and charming doctor. He asked me a bunch of questions about my sex life then checked my balls for syphilis. Unfortunately I'm a grower not a shower so I didn't get to exhibit my full talents but at that moment it was the least of my concerns. He also thought I was a med student because I knew the word 'prognosis' (doesn't everyone?) but maybe he was just trying to keep the mood light. He then ordered an HIV and syphilis blood test and I was back out into the waiting room.

After another brief wait I was called into a different part of the clinic to get a blood test from a nurse. There was one cute male nurse who was eyeing me but I had my test administered by a friendly chinese nurse who as you can imagine had a difficult time pronouncing syphilis. Had a pinprick and also some blood drawn from my arm. Needles don't bother me so neither hurt at all. Then it was back to the waiting room once more, for the results. 

The third wait was the longest, about half an hour. They had poor reception and no wifi so I was stuck playing chess on my phone and watching Independence Day on their tv. Jeff Goldblum has some questionable fashion choices in that movie (an ugly unbuttoned flannel shirt with a wife beater underneath? not very movie-star-esque.)

Finally I was called back by the cute doctor who had examined my package to reveal my test results. He didn't seem as cheery as before which made me feel like I was going to get bad news but luckily he told me I was completely negative and STD free!! I referenced [the doc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BUBd9dQvtY) from arrested development and he got the joke and brightened up again. He gave me some anti-biotics as a pre-caution and sent me on my way. It felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders seeing as I had convinced myself I was HIV positive the night before. Had a great rest of the day and cooked myself a nice dinner.

This scare has definitely changed how I will approach Grindr hookups in the future. Will always use protection, even if the guy is on prep. One moment of pleasure is not worth a lifetime of disease. Just wanted to share this as a lesson so some of you don't have to go through something similar (or even worse, seeing as I was one of the lucky ones) as well as my own selfish cathartic reasons. Stay safe and good health to you bros!"

August 6th I had sex with a woman. This encounter I would say was high risk.

• She was definitely promiscuous. No kids. Tubes already tied. 

• Before we had sex I noticed a handful of pills on her counter. They were prescribed, not abused. I only bring that up because she could've been taking medication for HIV. I heard when you first realize you have HIV and just get put on medication you still have a high viral load. 

• she has borderline personality disorder... I've been in relationships with BPD girls before and some do lie to an extreme extent. 

• she possibly dwindled with needles before. I can't confirm that but it is a possibility regarding her past. 

• the day before sex I had actually just shaved down there, definitely nicked myself. 

• we had rough sex.

• August 6th had sex, the following weeks up until now i have had tell tale symptoms. Fatigue, sore throats, headaches, diarrhea off and on, stuffy nose, runny nose, swollen lymph nodes in both my neck and groin that are persistent. August 24th I got a unexplainable rash on the inside of my thigh and it went away like 2 days later. August 29th I got a really dry mouth, 4 ulcers on my tongue, 2 on each side and tasted like a 9 volt batter on my tongue. I have possible thrush, my tongue is whiter and my breath smells stronger. 

• the symptoms had to be going on for two weeks. What worries me is the tongue ulcers and the unexplainable rash. 

Don't tell me to get test because I got my blood taken yesterday for the results (a few test were done, hiv, mono and a couple of other infections that the dr told me would make me feel crappy) I know it will be negative because you need at least three months. 

Does this sound like HIV to you?

6yn69i,My friend caught HIV,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/6yn69i/my_friend_caught_hiv/,Mx701750,73,9/7/2017 6:23,120,/r/askgaybros/comments/6yn69i/my_friend_caught_hiv/,NaN,"Confused rant.

I should preface this by explaining a bit of background. I met my mate about 2 years back when he first moved to my city. He was an international student from China studying something fashion. We met in a bar one night while I was out with some of my friends, he was propped up in the corner nursing a drink on his own, so I asked him to join us. 

We quickly became good friends and met regularly, updating each other about our lives. A prominent theme in his life in the UK from the very beginning was sex. At first, it was Grindr. Everything had to happen through Grindr. For him, it was a medium that offered a degree of legitimacy not found anywhere else. Through it, he sought friends, fuck buddies, tour guides (while travelling- who doubled as fuck buddies). 

By about 1 year after his arrival, he had graduated from a shy(ish) guy to a competitive athlete. He'd fuck pretty much everyone he'd meet through Grindr/Jackd/Scruff, except black guys (for reasons he never fully clarified). He especially liked fucking older white guys, as they made him feel mature. Before each of his latest endeavours tired and severed communication with him, he'd brag about the type of property they had, their professional status, or the cost of the meal they'd treated him to. Sex became as common as a handshake. 

He'd imbue all his escapades with qualities usually found amongst friends: trust, honesty, frankness, which worried me a lot. I'd tell him that sex wasn't a particularly good indicator of truth, or even an intention or desire to be friends. But he'd say, ""it's just sex"". To which I'd reply, ""that's exactly what I'm trying to say."" But it was pointless, he'd found his stride and was confident that he knew all there was to know. He'd flaunt statistics, telling me how difficult it was to contract HIV and how I shouldn't write off those who had it but were undetectable. Besides, most STIs are treatable, he'd say. So I'd roll my eyes, tell him *you do you* and we'd chat about other things. 

When he phoned me two days back asking me to meet him I just knew. When we met he told me he was positive. I hugged him and told him I was there for him, but I must have not expressed shock in the way that he'd anticipated (on account of my not being shocked at all) because he started accusing me of thinking he deserved it. I told him I thought he was being ridiculous, but he went on to cite the times I had said one thing or other about him catching an STI. I tried to explain that stating what I thought was a probable outcome of his sex life wasn't tacit condemning him, it was (based on what I knew) an objective conclusion. But he stormed out and hasn't been in contact since.  

He is a smart guy who had all the information to make an informed decision. He was apathetic towards his health as recent as 2 weeks back and now he's completely flipped. I don't know what to say or how to handle it. He is pretty alone and his family have no idea he is gay. And having HIV in China, where he is due to return, is something else. 

Next steps, ideas? 

**Edit:** why I provided the information about friend's sex life. My feeling is that my face gave away that I wasn't shocked, therefore I thought it necessary to explain why I wasn't shocked. It also conveys certain things that I guess I found concerning, like his attitude to sex in general. I guess I felt that there was a layer of reason that I just couldn't reach. 

It's also to give you a sense of his temperament, which I thought may be useful. Naming the fact that someone likes to have a lot of sex with a lot of people isn't the same as judging someone, neither is explaining their decision making process. It's something we spoke on a lot and that made me feel like I had to constantly tell him to be careful. We (were) are friends, not partners. I neither of us feels obliged to condone how the other lives. 

I shared his ethnicity to clarify the situation he will (if he hasn't already) find himself in. China is a different ball game when it comes to HIV and he isn't out to his family. I worry that this will complicate things drastically.  

I don't know how he contracted it (as in the incident that led to his + status), I'm not sure he does either. A few people mentioned his being a bottom as if it were a cause; he bottoms, but he prefers to top.  

Thanks for the advice. I'll give him some space and try him again on Friday. 

**Edit: special mentions.** 
The award for most useless piece of shit goes to (drum roll): i_am_human__aussie for their high effort, low impact trolling. I figure the poor guy clearly has so little in life that his efforts (and he's put a lot of effort in) ought to be recognised. Well done, today your very existence has been validated. "

Long story short, I do not hook up very often, but I met up with a guy today that blew me. When I got home I noticed some of the skin on the underside of my shaft looked a little irritated. I know it's unlikely to contract HIV through oral, but I'm sure chances increase if the skin is irritated. I'm really more afraid of herpes; it's the second most common STD. What are the chances of contraction from receiving oral sex?

On June 1st I was sexually intimate with an ex-boyfriend that I hadn't really spoken to in 5 years. I'm a gay male. I thought I was safe, and took the necessary precautions to protect myself. However, two weeks later I was knocked flat on my back by an illness. Severe body aches, extreme fatigue that took my breath away, low-grade fever (99.3-99.5), chills, headaches, rash on my elbows, dry patches on my face, bad metallic taste in mouth. My symptoms have continued to this day (3 months later). I was thinking this was acute retroviral syndrome (the symptoms of seroconversion 2-4 weeks after being infected with HIV) but these symptoms don't usually last 3 months so it confused me. I contacted my ex-boyfriend, and he claims to be HIV-negative. I didn't believe him because of my symptoms so I waited to get tested.

I tested:

9 weeks post exposure with a 4th generation antibody/antigen HIV blood test-Negative

12 weeks post exposure with an Oraquick at-home oral swab HIV test-Negative

13 weeks post exposure with an Oraquick at-home oral swab HIV test-Negative

14 weeks post exposure with a 4th generation antibody/antigen HIV blood test-Negative

I was constantly preparing myself for a positive result, so it shocked me to repeatedly get negative results. It was like I was holding my breath for my life to change forever, and it didn't happen each time. My doctor told me she no longer thinks it's HIV because I've consistently tested negative and outside the window period.

My symptoms have continued to this day (3 months later). I'm miserable. Essentially bed-ridden because of the fatigue. It kind of feels like I've run a marathon and lifted weights all day, then was hit by a truck afterwards. The mornings are terrible. It feels like I've had the flu for the last 3 months. I've been tested for mono (ebv), cmv, toxoplasmosis, endocarditis, sarcoidosis, lupus, thyroid, complete blood count, all other STDs, pretty much every test my doctor can think of. Everything came back normal and negative. The only thing I know I have is an enlarged spleen, but I've had that for almost a year now and that was found long before any of this ever happened. (October of 2016)

Do I need to test out to 6 months? The CDC says 97% of people have detectable antibodies by 3 months. I guess it's possible that I'm a late seroconverter.

Should I take a PCR RNA test? My doctor is extremely reluctant to give me one. She says she will only give one to me if I test positive on an antibody test, so I would have to go out of pocket to pay for this test. It's pretty expensive.

If anyone has any opinions on my situation, I would greatly appreciate it."

I just got here, but over the past 6 months I've been dealing with HIV and Health related anxiety due to a significant amount of risky encounters over the previous year in university, I kinda had a phase of discovering my sexual freedom, I guess you could say.

Anyways, the anxiety got so bad that I developed Irritable Bowel Syndrome and went from being the most calm, collected, person in my friend group, to having panic attacks alone in my bedroom. I have since been tested at least 4 times, the last time being 2 weeks before going on my internship. All came back negative. The last risky encounter (by risky I mean having a bare penis put inside my butt, although it was only for like 10 seconds, then we came to our senses and used a condom) I had was in May, so the final time I got tested in August should be conclusive. However I did have a final rendezvous at my city's gay bath house between getting tested and my departure, however I didn't have any penetrative sex.

Now I am two weeks into my new job in a foreign country, with limited access to healthcare, and while I feel as though I have mostly dealt with my HIV Anxiety, I still find myself taking note of every single symptom or bodily change that I find, and worrying for no reason. I can almost confidently say that I don't have HIV, but the anxiety I have gone through over the past 6 months has kept its hold on me and I don't want to have to deal with this for the next year while I'm away from home.

After a few exposures i became worried i might have been infected. I got a flu like 2 months after the last exposure so i was thinking it could be the ""acute retroviral syndrome"", i was freaking out a little bit but i tried to ignore it. Then like a month after, i woke up to a horrible rash on my neck. I researched the internet and came across the ""HIV rash"" which looked alike. After some time i also noticed a white lesion on the side of my tongue that was not going away, I researched the internet and was sure it was ""Oral Hairy Leukoplakia"" (HIV-related). I spent weeks comparing my tongue with the pictures I had found.

I didn't want to get tested because i had an important exam coming up in a couple months and i was afraid i might get depressed and fail the exam so i decided to wait. But It was clear for me, it was so obvious i had been infected, all the signs and symptoms matched the ones on internet, I lived months of horror and extreme anxiety. 

After my exam, i was afraid to get tested because i was scared to confirm it, so i procrastinated a little more. Until i got a cough that lasted many weeks and began to think i might have gotten tuberculosis and could infect my family so i finally decided to get tested. I was already picturing the word ""positive"" on my results, thinking where i would get the medicines and how I would to tell my parents. But It came out negative.

I found out my bed had been infested with bed bugs, their bites looked exactly like a  ""HIV rash"". What i thought was ""Oral Hairy Leukoplakia"" was in reality caused by bruxism  (bitting my tongue at night from all the anxiety i was going through), it resolved after using a dental guard.

The point of my story is: no signs or symptoms will be able to tell you if you are HIV positive or not and the internet will freak you out as you could relate everything with HIV. The only way to know is to get tested. And remember to always wear a condom, it is not worth going through all this."

Apparently, the mechanism of action is HPV.

One thing they didn’t make clear in the article is why this is the case. I can understand that an immunosuppressed person will be more susceptible to HPV. However, would this even be the case with someone who is undetectable? Does anyone know if the rates are higher even if you’re on HIV treatments?

Also, interestingly, the study described recommends the HPV vaccination even after anal precancer presents itself. I found this surprising, since I thought that, once you’re infected with HPV, the vaccine would not be useful. Maybe it boosts the immune system of people with HIV.

Anyway, I’d be interested in knowing what you’ve heard about this."

This is a huge moment, as it represents years of research and studies being confirmed by the lead infectious disease specialist in America. For years, a common argument against U=U has been that the studies results were not backed by the CDC.

Sadly they also acknowledge the barrier to making sure undetectability happens in all poz people is adequate health care. Nevertheless this is a milestone to celebrate.

I'm HIV+.  I'm not one of those fairytales where I went on meds and became undetectable after 2 weeks and end of story.  I developed AIDS before I sought treatment, have had major trouble staying adherent to my medication, and I'm resistant to multiple drugs.  I am not undetectable.

I met a guy I really like a few months ago.  We kept chatting.  We kept hanging out.  I kept evading his advances even though I guess it was obvious I'm very attracted to him.  After a month or so he cornered me with  ""Like, what's the deal man?"" and I broke down and it all tumbled out.  I was crying and shaking by the end of it.  He was so cool about it and just hugged me tight.

He actually likes me.  A lot.  I think he's falling for me.  I'm sure falling for him.

Until I met him I had not really been intimate since I tested positive 9 years ago.  I had met a couple men and given them oral and I melted down after even though I couldn't possibly have exposed them... guilt and fear.  I was crying and wondering if I should text them and tell them I'm positive after.  Stupid... but I still feel dirty and gross a lot.

I don't feel comfortable being intimate but the desire is so strong.  We've jerked off together and slept (like, sleeping in bed) together many times now.  We've done oral but even that makes me freak out a little, especially when he tries to give oral to me.   I've told him I don't enjoy getting oral but that's a lie just to make him stop because I'm afraid.  I completely freaked out when I got semen on his arm once.  I've broken down crying in bed a few times.  He is so patient and understanding that I don't understand him sometimes.

He is on PrEP... but my HIV is completely resistant to one of the drugs in Truvada and partially resistant to the other... I've just gone off Truvada actually as part of my treatment because it wasn't working.  My doctor does not know if that means if I can easily infect him or not despite the PrEP.  I have been completely honest with him about my HIV status and health.

It feels like he doesn't take it seriously.  He says he's not worried or afraid.  He really wants to do everything... and I guess I do too.  Sometimes I think it's like he fell for the ""undetectable = untransmittable"" advertising campaigns and he really doesn't know what he's getting into.... but I also know there were mixed status couples even before there were any HIV treatments. I know their comfort levels were different and all over the place.  

I'm so wrapped up and twisted about this and how I feel that I do not know if my thoughts are rational or sane at all.  Most of the time I don't understand why he has stayed with someone so broken and worthless so that's a clear sign I'm not thinking right about this.  I don't know what is reasonable here.  I don't even know how I should be thinking about this, unclouded by my fears and guilt and self-hatred and irrationality.

Advice would be so much appreciated... thank you for reading my rambling nonsense."

After all, an individual who does not know that he is HIV positive cannot logically be accused of its transmission.

This leads to failure to identify as many HIV positive people as possible will lead to higher rates of HIV spread than would otherwise occur. Multiple studies have now shown that individuals who are informed that they are HIV positive will commonly desist from high-risk sexual behaviour in an effort to protect sexual partners from the virus, but may not do so if they are unaware of their own status.

The second negative consequence of delayed testing is that many HIV-infected persons may not become diagnosed until at least several years after infection, thus giving the virus an opportunity to replicate throughout this time and cause significant, often irreversible, damage to the immune system.

From a personal note: Yes people who are psychopathic and uncaring, or possibly of low intelligence and unable to assess the consequence of their actions should get detained but not because it was HIV specifically.

I was last tested for STIs in June. I was clean and started PreP. Traveled around Asia until recently.

Over a little over three months I've had around 50 sexual partners. Most are oral (both ways) and no anal at all, with the exception of two people: one penetrated me (without consent) for less than 10 seconds and the other I penetrated for less than a minute. In both of those cases it was unprotected, although the first guy claims to be on PreP.

Since coming home, I have learned two things. First, one of the partners I gave oral sex to (luckily for less than a minute) was withholding the fact that he was HIV positive for more than a year with an undetectable viral load. Second, the last person I was with (3 weeks ago) just tested positive for HIV during a preliminary finger prick HIV test, and considering he had tested negative just a month before and has been abstinent for several months, the possibility is I infected him (if it is not a false positive). He is also reporting that his tongue ""has lost feeling and is cracking"" which he blames on contracting HIV from giving me oral.

He is now waiting on the results of his blood test. Yes I know the first test could just be a false positive although he is (admittedly) making me feel like shit.

Both of these bombshells make me exceptionally worried to the point of nausea. Not to mention that if I did catch HIV while on PreP, there's a good chance it'll be drug resistant... Obviously I'm going to get tested first thing tomorrow morning. Even though I was hoeing around with a lot of partners, I was pretty good at taking my daily pill and trying to limit risk by sticking to oral, but I am now shocked with so much self-hatred and regret. Considering the guy forget to mention he was positive before begging me to suck his dick, I worry others may have tricked me also... and that I'm a naive fucking idiot.

Have any of you dealt with this before? How did you cope?"

Maybe someone asked something like that before, but ill go ahead and start. Please i would appreciate advice , especially if you’ve gone thru something similar. I have lived all my life knowing that I’m attracted to girls , aswell as guys. Coming from a very traditional and conservative immigrant family , being in a gay relationship was kinda impossible ( even hooking up , due to strict curfews) . So I’ve had my fair share of straight relationships. Once i was 18 , i went to college and i started having encounters with guys. Due to my parents thinking i was studying all the time, i could lie and go out to meet guys. I live in a big north american city , and meeting gay guys is freakin easy. At first , i would hook up every other month with a different guy. Once I hit 19 it was every other week. When i hit 20 , it was every couple of days or at-least once a week, again most of the time a different guy id meet off grindr, scruff or craigs. Im still 20 , but i stopped a month ago. Its been almost a year that I’ve been having very grave feveres, soar throats and all that stuff that comes with it. It would last a week or 10 days tops , and would go thanks to antibiotics and advils. It would come back every (almost) 30 days. I’m scared i might have HIV... thats the reason i stopped hooking up... Ive been with more than 80 guys and NEVER wore a condom. Now before you guys say anything about the condom thing, let me explain something: I have never had Anal sex ( top and btm). With more than half those guys (50-60 ) , all we’ve done was jerk off , cuddle, get rimmed and kiss sometimes. With maybe 5 guys ( that was during my first encounters when i was dumb and naive) , I would do all of what i mentioned and would let the guy rub his dick constantly over my hole (never in), and ive sucked max 2 guys for like 5 seconds and no cum was involved. For the rest of the guys , it was mostly jerking off , cuddling , kissing , getting sucked and gettin rimmed. Im scared to death and depressed because of my thoughts of having HIV/AIDS, due to my bad and reoccurring fevers. I feel like i might have it... im scared of getting tested too , i just cant live with it if its true... and if it were to be true , i cant tell anyone... especially not my parents. In their culture hiv is probably the worst thing u can get. Now is question time :
1) all the sexual activities that i had , from what i know , put me in little risk of hiv. Has anyone gotten hiv from them tho? I mean statistics and reality can sometime be not too acurate..

2) how can i convince myself to get tested?  How can i face that fear of getting tested? I just feel like it would be a death sentence if i were to have hiv ( given my background, dependance on parents,life, and future)

3) any comments or stories , i would appreciate them guys!"

So i have a question and was hoping you all could maybe ease my mind. About 2 months ago, I experimented with a guy off of craigslist who said he is/was clean. I only gave him oral, and he did not fully finish in my mouth. That was that. 

Well fast forward to now, we're covering STDs in health class. I read up on the initial symptoms of HIV, and notice that flu like symptoms within the first week to 6th week after contact are common. This freaked me out, because I remembered that 9 days after the hook up, I came down with a fever and chills. These fever and chills only lasted for a day or 2. At the same time I thought I had bronchitis, so I went in to the doctor the next day and they indeed diagnosed me with bronchitis. While i'm sure my fever and chills was due to the bronchitis, I can't help but think theres a possibility it could've been HIV. 

So this morning,I went and got tested and am now awaiting results. I only had oral sex (and I did not have any bleeding sores or gums at the time as far as i'm aware of), and I know the chances of that are low. But with my sickness occurring within the right time frame for the symptoms to occur (granted, good chance they were due to the bronchitis I was diagnosed with), I am very worried theres a chance this test could come back positive. 

Can someone put my mind at ease?


additional info edit: I asked the guy whom I hooked up with if he was clean after I had gotten home that night, and he said he was and was in a long term relationship before the hook up, and had never done anything like that before, and had gotten tested during the relationship and was clean. I emailed him again last night while I was worrying about all of this, and he replied with the same thing, that he was clean.

When the doctor starts going over my blood work he wants to talk about my cholesterol, I have to force him to skip ahead to HIV so I can even concentrate on anything else he says. 

I got the negative back, and it's like the biggest weight off my shoulders. I want to throw myself a party, basically to celebrate that my pretty-good adherence to safer sex practices has led to no change in my HIV status. (That would be quite a party invitation.)

Normally I always practice safe sex, I've always been adamant about that. But on Grindr a month ago, I met this dude that looked a lot like Daniel Radcliffe. I'll call him Stan. And he indicated some mutual interest in me as well. We spoke a lot. What kind of sex we liked (he's a pure top, I'm vers), and eventually ofc, that we should fuck. Stan said he wanted to fuck me raw and colonise me (yes I'm a Po.C)  and that gave me a super hard boner. I said that really turns me on dude, but, safe sex is too important for me.

Stan tried convincing me and eventually won me over, that he's started PrEP not too long ago, so this is all completely safe. Don't worry. So I eventually agreed thinking if I do it just this once, I'll be fine. Yeah. So I offered to host and he came over to my apartment. He was really sweet, I offered him some wine before he grabbed my crotch and thats when we hit it off. Before I knew it I was on my back, legs on his shoulder and he was lubing up his bare 7 inch uncut cock, and I felt that sharp sting as it entered me. So we fucked like that until he abruptly stopped, began moaning heavily and I knew he was cumming inside me. I'll say it here, bros - you dont feel anything when he cums inside you. Its not worth it.

Anyways, we got cleaned up, then I got ready to leave. Stan said he really enjoyed it and loved coming over. He had a great time. Then he got dressed, kissed me and left.  The first red flag was when as soon as I opened Grindr, his profile was nowhere to be found - he blocked me.

Then sure enough, skip forward to a few days ago, I woke up in the middle of the night feeling as sick as a dog. Night sweats alternating with horrible chills. And just feeling completely dead. I had to take time off my studies. And thats when i knew.

Booked a trip to the sexual health clinic, got tested, venal puncture HIV test. He said I'd get an automatic text confirming I'm HIV Negative if it came to that. Two days later though, I instead got a phone call. He asked in a neutral voice if I could come in that day. I said is everything ok? he said, yeah it is, we just need to follow up something with you.

When I got there, he told me, I'm afraid the test has come back positive and I will need to be referred elsewhere for medication.  And I won't even go into detail as how I broke down there emotionally in tears as my worst fear was confirmed. So Stan lied about being on Prep.

I feel empty. And lonely. And dirty. And that no one will ever want to be with me, except perhaps as a fetish fuck and then just discard and block me. I wonder if its even worth still living, as if gay life wasn't already hard enough. I hate myself. I took a single risk and, look what happened. I will be tainted with this disease for as long as I live. And I am only 21. Yep, thats right, 21. My life has been changed. Forever. It will never be the same as I once knew it. I will never be free of this guilt.

I don't know what to do next. My parents will be so emotionally distraught once they find out the son they were once so proud of has gotten to this. 

#Anyways I'm putting this in bold. Bros. If someone asks you for unprotected sex and its okay because they're on Prep - ITS NOT OKAY.  There is nothing you can do on the spot to make them prove they are actually on it/otherwise HIV neg. Please don't fall into the same trap I did. I made a mistake, and its now a 30-minute-mistake I will live with for the rest of my life."

I am a 19 yo gay boy from a developing country recently brought the courage to try online dating where i met this cute guy. we texted back and forth for 2 weeks then finally he came over. we didn't do anything particular aside from me sucking him for a bit. the night went on mostly hugging, kissing and talking. the next time he came over he brought condoms so we engaged actual sex. i bottomed him first which ended up me coming all over my sheets. then we switched places me being top. the third time he came over the things happened just about the same only this time him having a hard time to cum. the thing is we always used condoms but occasionally i did give him head although those never really lasted long i didn't use any protection during oral. so today he texts that his test came positive and even though i did my best to be supportive back in my mind i was sorta freaking out. i also have to add that he was open to me that he had practiced unprotected sex before. this has been more of a rant than a question but i really needed to take this out. so what my next action should be?"

A good friend of mine passed away in September. We were FWB and I found out after he died that he was HIV positive. As he got sicker and sicker and basically deteriorated in front of me the 6 months prior to him passing, I never asked what he was suffering from and he never told me.

We hooked up regularly for about 1.5 years and then off and on for another 1.5 years. I would consider what we did low risk (Mostly jacking each other off and oral (him performing on me)) but there where times when we tried anal and it was protected. The oral however never was.

Since I never asked his status and he never told me his status, I have no clue how or when he contracted the virus. 

I decided to get a hiv test 2 days after he died and then again today. Both came back negative and i feel lucky. I just hate it took this to finally get tested and read up on prevention. This situation has also made me kind of scared to have sex with anyone in the future because thd only way to know for sure we safe is to go get tested for everything under the sun before we have sex..... i feel stupid. I'm 30 years old and basically have my shit together. Idk how or why the hell i thought I would never come in contact with HIV or other STIs. Hard pill to swallow. Even harder lesson learned. "

Sorry if the thread I’ve started doesn’t belong here, I’m brand new to reddit so if I’ve broken some unspoken rule I’ll promptly delete this.

Anyway, I’m asking this because I want to know if anyone here has ever experienced the same incessant anxiety I’m having over HIV.


I blew a guy from Tinder on Sunday (hooray for first hookup!?) and since then I’ve felt like I’m a carrier of HIV. The following day I worriedly went to an urgent care clinic in the hopes I can be prescribed PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) but she promptly refunded me the consultation fee and was confident I didn’t become infected, but she referred me to a Health Department so I can test for other STDs as that can get expensive without insurance. However, I’m reading on the internet that, although very small in numbers, there have been reported cases of HIV transmission through oral sex whilst others say it’s only theoretically possible and there are no solid cases of this... I provide all this info just to show how (probably irrationally) anxious and obsessed I am with this, and I don’t know if it’s only natural to be this fearful or if I have some other mental issues I need to work out. Sorry for long post.

Edit: I meant “she” as in the doctor I consulted with."

So I guess I'll start by saying I'm a closeted bisexual male and for a while now I have neglected my sexual health screenings big time. 

On the weekend I was pretty drunk and had unprotected sex with another male. The first time we had sex was protected and then he took off the condom to cum, then we sat and had a smoke and he ended up trying to fuck me again, this time without a condom. My inhibitions were low and I asked him if he was clean to which he assured me he was (I know I'm stupid for basing my trust on just word value) so we tried to go at it again to which we stopped because I was in a bit of pain, he never got to cum inside me but that doesn't mean there wasn't residual cum left over from the first time he came. The next day I started freaking out thinking ""omg we had unprotected sex I need to get tested immediately"" but I left it until 55 or so hours to get to a medical centre to which they scared the absolute shit out of me and started me on PEP. 

So come to today, I get a call from the sexual health clinic and it turns out I tested positive for rectal chlamydia but negative for everything else including HIV. But from my understanding, a HIV test can only test 3 months prior to the date of testing, is that correct? 

I'm now doing PEP, antibiotics for chlamydia and have regular follow up screenings for the next three months all due to one fucking encounter which I stupidly agreed to unprotected sex. My anxiety is through the roof right now and I've been diagnosed with depression from a young age and the thoughts have already started invading my mind that I should just kill myself right now. I know I'm being totally unreasonable but can someone PLEASE help me through this, I'm begging you! Has anyone been through a similar process? I feel like my world is crumbling before me. 

Thank you in advance to anyone that can provide any support whatsoever, I can't tell you how much it means right now. "

I don't even know how to cover everything, but I'll try to do it the shortest way I can. Thanks you for your comments!

Me (23) &amp; my boyfriend (25) have been in a 4 year relationship. We've had our ups and downs, but we're in a very good &amp; stable place at the moment. I must say, he is my first and only for pretty much everything: kiss, date, hook-up, relationship, sex, etc.

About 2 and a half years ago, he was detected as HIV+. During the first year he decided to not tell me, but convinced me of stopping having sex, saying he didn't feel it was right and saying he always felt uncomfortable and guilty afterwards. As I loved him and wanted to be with him, I accepted.

Fast-forward to a year later - One night, after me trying to get him into having sex, he told me about him being HIV+. He said he hadn't told me before as he was afraid of people knowing it and of me leaving him. We had a long conversation that night, lots of tears, but I told him I love him and that I wanted to be with him.

After that we started to have a more open conversation about it, and decided to start having sex again, start using condoms (we didn't use to - awuful, I know), keep having regular check-ups on me and everything... but that didn't last too much. 

He just couldn't get into having sex. He says he just don't feel comfortable. He feels afraid of something happening and me getting HIV,  and overall he feels very subconscious about it. I understand him feeling that way and I've tried to be comprehensive and patient all the time. He now doesn't get aroused anymore, and whenever he does he shuts it down immediately. We've talked about it and he has said he is ok with not having sex anymore, he doesn't see it as a need in his life and just prefers to avoid it.

He knows that's not very fair to me, to the point he has even suggested on giving me ""permission"" to hook-up with other guys and just not letting him know. I've shut down that idea as the guy I want to be with is him. Recently, however, I've felt how my sexual needs have started to go up and I've even started to think about hooking up with someone. I must admit I've even downloaded Grindr - never met with anyone - but thinking about it, getting to chat with guys and deleting it time after time feeling guilty.

I just don't know what to do. I do have sexual needs to the point of thinking on hooking up, but I don't want to hurt or cheat on my boyfriend. I would like to start making love with him again, but I know he feels uncomfortable about it and that when I do some kind of advance he just moves away and stops it.

Any advice would be appreciated. Any questions just let me know and I'll answer. I probably left a lot out but just trying to give you the whole picture."

Went to his hotel, picked up lube and condoms on the way, then he offered me some wine and I drank too quickly.

I was feeling lonely tonight and went to a park.  About 2 hours ago, I met a man, probably in his late 40s, and we went to a dark corner where I started giving him a blowjob.  This escalated to him trying to have penetrative sex with me.   I was pretty reluctant about doing it bareback - or having anal sex at all - so I kept alternating between giving him a blowjob and letting him try to have penetrative sex with me. He only managed to put the head in and maybe a few more.  I blew him off and I swallowed.

Now I am back home, and my anus has some tears and it also bled.  I am now freaking out because I'm assuming that his pre-cum got into contact with my blood.  

After our encounter, he wanted us to remain in touch, but I did not.  So I lied that I don't have a phone, and he gave me his number and asked to call him when I get a phone.  After seeing the blood and panicked, I called him three times to ask him if he is clean.  I would have said that I took my friend's phone or something.  I guess I needed reassurance or comfort even if he would have lied, because I have no one else to talk to. However, he is not taking my calls.  It's past 1.30 a.m now, so I guess he is asleep.

Not sure if this is relevant info, but I am assuming that he is mostly top.  He did not touch my penis at all and seemed only interested in my ass and getting a blowjob.  He also mentioned that he has a wife after we did all that.  When I asked him if he gets with guys often, he said that he used to hook up with a guy ""about a decade ago, but then he left the country"".  I'm not convinced that I'm the only guy that he's been with in the last decade though.  Also, if he was adamant in barebacking me and cumming inside me, I'm assuming he could be that careless with other people as well.

What should I do? My biggest concern is that his pre-cum has possibly got into contact with my blood through anal tearing, so is this a highly effective way of contacting the virus if he is HIV+? Should I get tested first thing in the morning, or is there a time period that I should wait before getting tested?

Thank you."

Basically around 3 weeks ago I hooked up with someone from Grindr. I’m in my 20’s and he was also in his 20’s, I’m unsure of his HIV status. He gave me unprotected oral, I then had protected anal sex (I was top) for around 5 minutes and to my knowledge the condom did not break. I couldn’t really keep it up anyway so I ended up pulling out and removing the condom. He then gave me oral again and I finished in his mouth.

Roughly 3 weeks later, aka today, I wake up with quite bad aches all over my body, fatigue, a chesty cough, runny nose, and as I got home from work I had a small amount of diarrhea. I suffer from quite bad anxiety and needless to say, I am panicking big time. Obviously it is flu season, and a few of my friends and colleagues have recently had cold’s, but I find it strange that this all just came out of nowhere over night, especially 3 weeks after this encounter.

Can anybody help educate me as to what my risk is? I’m interested to hear some opinions and I would love to hear some information to put my mind at rest. This is really getting me down. I feel like all the symptoms are adding up way too fast, and I’m not sure I could cope with being diagnosed with HIV. 

Before this, the only other encounter similar to this I have had was around 9 months ago in which only oral was involved. 

Thank you :( "

I have two rules: one that I always use condoms and two that I don’t let a guy have penetrative sex with me without seeing his test results. I met a guy who said he was “hiv negative and clean.” I get to his place and things are going good but a few things put me off to him. I asked him if he had condoms prior to getting to his place and when I asked him for a condom to perform oral sex he couldn’t “find one.” I always come prepared and had a condom. He then tried to pressure me into penetrative sex. I kept telling him not without seeing his test results. He then suggests that I sleep over to which I say no. Anyways, after hooking up we text back and forth for the next few days and he keeps saying that he wants to have penetrative sex with me to which i repeat my rule. After a few days of this back and forth, he finally admits that he is hiv positive and undetectable. I push him for more answers and it turns out he isn’t on any ARV medication and using “natural” medication. I am livid. I am so upset and i tell him that he is a douche for lying to me about 1. Being hiv negative and 2. Being undetectable when he isn’t on any medication. I tell him that he can not say he is undetectable if he isn’t on ARV and that if he does he is purposely lying and trying to spread hiv to people who may not ask him all the questions I did.

Anyways, I made a CG ad today and this dude responded to me not knowing it was me. I replied back and asked him if he is willing to have “raw sex” and if he is drug and disease free an he said yes to both of those questions. I know he is hiv positive and not being treated. I am so upset right now because I think he is lying and spreading hiv to unsuspecting guys.

(Btw I am on Prep. He didn’t know that and I am so thankful that I’m on it for situations like this.)

What do I do?

Tldr; i know a guy is hiv positive and not on treatment and tonight he responded to a post to have condomless sex with “me” and said he is hiv negative. I believe he is intentionally spreading hiv and I don’t know how to stop him. 

*to be clear my ad was not to have condomless sex. I recognized his email handle and when I typed the number he provided in the newest add his name pulled up. Once i knew it was the same guy i asked about condomless sex and hiv status to see if our convo made him stop lying. It didn’t. He is still pretending to be hiv negative."

Anal sex is 18 times more likely to transmit HIV compared to vaginal sex, and an estimated 1 in 15 gay/bisexual men have HIV.  On top of that, STDs are more easily transmitted in smaller, more insular communities like the gay community.

In the midst of the action, something prevented me from asking him to put on a condom, and he came in me bareback. He admitted that he did it because he's convinced he wouldn't be able to transmit anything.

The guy is negative, last tested in September last year though. Since then he had sex once, two weeks ago, with a doctor who, who was negative too and tests regularly each 3 months, but it wasn't very succesful. The doctor topped the guy, and was wearing a condom but then the guy started bleeding, so they stopped. Before his HIV test in September, he bottomed twice with one guy who was negative (with a condom).

In late december, I was going through some friction with my girlfriend, and we went out to a bar together, and a guy was pursuing me aggressively after she left and I decided to stick around. I ended up going back to his after I was wasted, I gave him a BJ, whatever. 

A week later, I decided to test the waters on CL and ended up hooking up with an attractive TS, and nothing happened between us that would have been decidedly risky, no unprotected penetration, some oral, etc. 

The thing is, I got a canker sore a couple weeks later and was petrified that I got syphilis. And gave it to my GF. 3 months later, I'm pretty sure I don't have it. 

This past month, her and I had unprotected sex, and then a few weeks later she got the flu. Cue a full blown HIV scare. I couldn't access rapid HIV testing until about 4 days later, and thank my lucky stars I'm negative. I got off easy. But those 4 days were horrific.

If you're the type of person to have a conscience, or to worry excessively about your health, I can 100% say that infidelity or random hookups are things you're probably not built for, and will lead to further shitposts on this sub beyond this one.

TLDR - If you didn't put yourself at acute risk, but you're still worrying if you got the big one, it's probably because of your guilty conscience and you should take a look at that and make better decisions. "

So I have a pretty dryass nose and I was doing some cooking with my partner. For reference, we have been using protection every time but I still don't know if he's H+. So that having been said, here's the story. 

I picked my nose and pulled out this huge ass booger, which then led to a pretty massive nosebleed and what I think is a pretty good-sized open scab in my nose. The thing is, I asked for a tissue from my partner (who had just cut his finger) and some of his blood got on my finger. Like a dumbass and unable to tell that the blood was mine, I stuck my finger into my nose to plug up the bleeding. Now I don't know if that blood got into direct contact with the open scab and I'm not sure if there was a possibility that if he had HIV that his blood could have traveled up my nosebleed and got into the wound and into the bloodstream. I know that the nose is pretty receptive since its a mucuous membrane, but I don't know if this qualifies as a deep wound. Am I just being paranoid or is this small amount of blood enough to get infected? 

Is there a chance I can get an HIV infection from this incident? I'm a bit scared to be honest.

This Friday I had a sexual encounter with another man. I was on top.

I wanted to have safe sex, but in the heat of the moment I had 1 unsafe insertion. This is really stupid of me, but I was enjoying the moment very much. And I did not expect it to happen that fast or something. After that, we did put on a condom.

I am not circumcised, so I am very afraid of being infected with HIV. That he tried to have unsafe sex worries me, he will have done this with other people too. 

What do you guys think the risk is? The risk for topping as an uncircumcised guy seems to be 0.63%. But is it lower if it was just once, and then we put a condom on?

I am really afraid. Are there some stats that would put my mind at ease?"

They said that it won't matter in the results at all, so I went and proceeded anyway, the result was positive.

I was in denial, shocked and scared. Finally I calmed down like in 15 minutes because of all the things I know about HIV, so these people there gave all this information about how is not the end of the world, and blah blah. They took some more blood to send it to a lab to confirm that indeed it's HIV. I was told to wait for a week for the results which is going to be this coming Thursday. 

I saw the test, (two dots means it's positive), and the second dot on the test thingy was very faint and barely noticeable, and part of me is not how fully convinced. I know that these tests are very accurate, and that cold or flu don't really affect the result, but again part of me has hopes that it's a false positive because I always used condoms with partners and never did oral, so that really makes feel confused.

I'm fully aware that I am 90% of the time just blowing everything out of the water with anxiety, it's been my MO for awhile.

I was at a bar talking to some women when we had to run my cousin back across the street to the hotel due to him getting into arguments. When we came back there were shots on the table for us and I really  remember almost nothing after that. The only thing I remember is being in a car with one of the ladies and that guy being really grabby from the backseat.

Woke up at the lady's house the next morning and she dropped me off at my car. I've talked to her since and she's the guy did kiss me when we dropped him off. She said “you did get out to piss at one point and he followed you out. Don't know what happened but you were only gone about 45 seconds and didn't say anything when you got back in”.

That was last Friday night/Saturday morning. It's not Sunday and I have been sick as fuck. Sore throat, head stuffed up, probably one of the worst coughs I've ever had. Obviously the first thing that comes to mind to me is HIV. As far as I've been told from her nothing happened that night aside from the kiss part. I have since noticed that the condom from my wallet is gone but that honestly could have been gone for awhile before hand. I may have just forgotten to replace it. I would think if anything else happened I would be a bit sore the next day. I obviously know nothing about this person so their status would be unknown to me.

I know the general consensus will likely be that I am being overly anxious. But I know that I will not be able to calm down until I can be tested. Apparently HIV RNA tests are able to detect after 11 days? The only thing I can find about those is through this site:

Grindr and similar apps really takes a big toll in my place. I live in a third-country world with a closeted homosexual community but with very sexually active gays. And even the worst part is that most of us does not have proper education on HIV, safe sex, and even bother to test themselves. And PrEP is also not a norm in here.

Meanwhile, I tested myself and I am negative, after sleeping with around 100 or more within three years. Currently having a monogamous relationship with someone I trust for more than 3 years now.

So recently I browsed on non-gay social media. I realized that several of my hookups I met on Grindr were actually within close circle of friends of mine. My and his friend, who is not gay, recently posted that this guy passed away. I stalked on his social media account and he posted that he was sick and getting thinner everyday (which is most likely a last stage of AIDS).

And this not only once. Few months back I also found out some guys I slept with was also passed away due to sickness, with people saying that he got severe pneumonia.

And not being too judgemental, but knowing how sexually active we were (of course including myself), it is almost certain that they died of HIV/AIDS.

I am kinda scary how Grindr and those apps easily help spreading HIV in my country. I don't deny that hook up is really fun and I also like it. Yes, those feeling and adrenaline rush when getting ourself wild really satisfying and addicting. But I decided to protect myself so I would not get that unfortunate fate. But seemingly many gays in my place don't think the same. Thus they keep f-ing around unsafely.

So how about you guys, have you ever realized your past hook up dead by HIV while yourself are perhaps still negative? How did you feel?

And for myself, I don't think I want to get to know people from those apps anymore. I better to live in celibacy rather than risking myself and also people I sleep with."

I had a bout of drunkeness on a Sunday morning two weeks ago. I went to a hotel with 3 guys just to simply have a little bit of fun for once. I partook in smoking some meth, even drank some concoction they had that was ""like estacy"" ... reckless it was. But I had never been. And I had fun with this.

-But things started taking a turn when I had a slight tingly feeling in my urethra. I knew something was up. 


-There was also what appeared to be a single ulcer on my penis shortly after, but I thought it was due to jacking off too hard. That's happened before.


-A few days later I happened to have some diarrhea at noon. But I cooked some goulash with undercooked meat just then and that's happened before.


-A few days later I get 3 bouts of night sweats. Usually I get night sweats when I drink too much and even get it all the time when I'm not.

By now it's been 2 weeks and a half. The ""ulcer"" healed, but the tingly urethra has not. So I go to the doctor and get treated premptively for gonorrhea and they give me an antibiotic shot with a pill of Azithromycin.

That was 3 days ago. But I'm feeling lethargic, and was tired after taking the antibiotic. But now I'm really scared for the results to come back.

Pacing back and forth, crying, unable to sleep.


There was penetration but I backed out, went into the shower before actually going all the way. The fact that I could have something makes it all the more tragic.

I'm doing a rapid today. 

I expect that I have HIV. I'm preparing mentally that yes, this is what I have. If it says positive I won't even be surprised. All I ask is for just one chance, I won't do anything like this again. I never knew just how much of a minefield it would be. I'm not promiscuous. They say the virus dies when exposed to air in 3 minutes or less. The sex I had wasn't even 3 minutes.

I thought where I lived HIV was a rare disease. I can't afford to be taken by this sickness because I'm not strong enough. I won't be who I was before. And I will die.

UPDATE:

He texted me back, he was out of town. He got tested last month and all good!

Backstory:

Late 2016 I met a sexy and wealthy daddy on Grindr. He was negative, and we fucked bareback during the summer. More than three months passed, I got tested, and the result came back negative *phew!*


Present Day:

In early February 2018 I contacted him and I topped him bareback again, since he said he was negative and I had not reason to doubt him. But when I left his place I saw a meth pipe on the kitchen counter **RED FLAG**. I would've gotten PEP jic but I'm not from the US and I don't know where to get it.

This past week I had bareback sex two times with a close friend since we trust each other. I told him that I had bb sex with this guy in february (told him he was negative), and he was cool with it so we fucked a third time. I bottomed all three times.

Now I'm trying to contact this Daddy but his Grindr profile is gone. I've been trying to text him through Whatsapp but he hasn't answered. He got the first three messages, but the last one I sent today didn't go through. My iphone is jailbroken so I can track when he is online and offline on Whatsapp and he hasn't been online these past days, so he didn't block me. Now I'm getting anxious. He has a partner so there might be a chance they're out on holiday or he lost his side phone???

My friend is out of town but comes back this weekend, and I'm going to tell him about the situation. But I'm nervous because he overthinks stuff and he's kind of insecure and I'm scared he might not be able to handle it. I just don't want him to feel like it's the end of the world, because it isn't.

Should I wait till next month and get a rapid test? It's been two months. Or should I tell my mom (she's a doctor and very supportive when I had a HPV scare) and get proper blood work done ASAP?? (I don't want to freak her out when there might be a chance it comes back negative) So I can tell my friend accurate information.

I'm trying to stay objective and calm since this Daddy didn't lie to me in the past, and worst case scenario its only been two months and I can start treatment and become undetectable (= Untransmitable) in a couple of months.

TL;DR: Fucked bb a daddy (who turned out to be a T user) this February, and bottomed for a friend this past week. Daddy is MIA so I'm worried he might have infected me with HIV.

I asked him his testing status, told me he's equally paranoid as me basically so he knows he doesn't have anything. He wouldn't suck me off because he was worried I might have something.

Any possible chance I could get HIV from his load coming into contact with the raised red area? I used my nail to scratch my skin in a different area, which appeared red with blood but the stomach area was more pink than anything.

So my boyfriend and I had a threesome last night for the second time with the same person — the first time was about a month ago. This man has only done it safely (condoms) with us, and says that he only does it safely with others as well. The last time that this man was tested was August of 2017, and is getting retested this week.

As a aside, following our first encounter with him, I had displayed HIV-like symptoms but I figured that they were due to me playing doctor on google and blowing things out of preparation out of anxiety since it was our first time. I had night sweats for about a week, but in just the past few days, two warts developed on my hand.

Back to last night — as I was the receiver, I focused on the both of them. My boyfriend finished inside me and the third shot on top of me. My concern is that when we got home, I discovered that the corner of my mouth was cracked from a sudden cold snap we’ve had, and I performed oral on both of them.

I’ve searched up and down google but I couldn’t track down any info other than that oral sex is considered “low risk” and that transmission of HIV orally through cum/pre-cum has only been documented through cuts *inside* the mouth — I couldn’t find any information about cuts outside/next to the mouth. 

He had masturbated before we arrived, so I’m not sure he had much pre-cum, but I’m sure there was a little, and I’ve been anxious to no end. We’ve both booked STD screenings to take place in two weeks, but I just wanted to see if anyone here could tell me what the likelihood is of me contracting HIV. "

I didn’t know where else to turn, so my best friend was tested positive for HIV yesterday. He’s handling it better than I am, tbh. My best friend is gay, while I’m straight, however we have a special bond. If i am being 100% honest we are platonic Soul Mates. I deeply love the dude, it's the closet thing I have ever been to being ""in love"". I was unaware that this kind of love, and bond existed until I met him. I have not met someone more beautiful, and kind as he is. He not only makes my life better but he truly makes this world a better place. I thrive to be more like him in my day to day life. When he smile, I smile. When he hurts, i hurt. I can look at him and know exactly what he is thinking. He has made me a better man. He has been the biggest blessing in my life. 

Usually when he is going through something, I am able to help. Whether it’s a break up, school wise, family, etc....I can always help him feel better and heal him. I’m feeling helpless right now, because he’s hurting inside and this time around, I can’t do anything to help, other than be there for him. But I don’t feel like that’s enough. I don’t want him to hurt guys, he’s such a strong dude but i see he’s hurting inside. I feel like this is a bad nightmare, and I’m waiting to wake up and text him like “bro you won’t believe the dream I had”. 

I understand HIV is treatable and isn’t the big bad wolf as seen years ago. I know. But I’m still afraid bro, he means everything to me. We’re suppose to grow old together and live, I’m so afraid that I’m going to lose him early on, and I don’t know what to do. He doesn’t deserves this. I wish I was able to handle the disease for him. 

I don’t want him to fall into depression, or develop low self esteem. He has overcome BOTH of those situations already and i don’t want him to go back into that because he worked so fucking hard to overcome that. He’s great amazing phenomenal guy, and he isn’t less than me or anyone because of this. He's worthy of love and an affection just as much as anyone else.

Not sure what I am looking for when it comes to responses. Just some words of encouragement, I guess. Idk, maybe, some advice. I dropped everything and went to see him yesterday and we both broke down. But we both pulled it together (mostly him). I’m going to continue being the strong for him, face to face. But right now, while alone, I’ve been crying all day long, and just idk…......a mess.

What are your views on HIV criminizational laws? Do you agree with NC’s new law, their old law, or do you think disclosure should never be required regardless of viral load status? "

Seeing as how HIV disproportionately affects MSM I thought I'd try here for some enlightenment!

What are your thoughts on serosorting? Specifically, HIV+ serosorting for only other HIV+ people.  This is a strategy for HIV+ people to eliminate the risk of transmitting the virus to others, by only having (condomless) sex with others with the same status. I don't know how popular this is, or whether it is seen as reasonable.

I'm doing a research project on viral recombination and circulating recombinant strains (CRFs).  These strains happen when a person is infected with more than 1 subtype of HIV, creating a hybrid. They can be associated with faster progression to AIDS in some cases.  My report is mostly scientific but I find it will be important to understand the social aspects of it and the experiences of people living with HIV. 

Some guiding questions are:

1) If you were HIV+ (or if you are) would this be something you would want to do?
2) Is it unreasonable to ask that 2 HIV+ people should continue to use condoms despite sharing the same status? (to prevent CRFs)
3) From your experience/knowledge, is it common for 2 HIV+ people to use condoms despite sharing the same status?
4) Are you personally aware of the idea that undetectable=transmissible?  (i.e. there have been no reported cases of a virally repressed person transmitting the virus to a sexual partner, even without condoms)
5) Do you think your friends/community is aware of U=U?


Thank you so much for your help in providing an important perspective that is hard to come by in research. If I've said anything offensive to HIV+ people or gay/bisexual men I am terribly sorry, and please let me know so that I can be careful of my wording in the future. 

Thanks!

I thought the stages of grief came in order, but I’m rapidly alternating between being in denial, being frustrated, and accepting the implications of being HIV+. I don’t know how to let my emotional floodgates open properly, and I’m terrified what would happen. There’s so much going on right now. I’m graduating college next month, interviewing for jobs, and my grandma may die in a few weeks. If I start to feel, I don’t know how far I’ll fall or how long I’ll take to get up. 

I know HIV isn’t as bad as it used to be, but I’m worried about the long term health effects of the virus and medication on my health. I’m scared of being socially limited. It’s been hard making gay friends, and I feel like this is another wall.

I’m also really ashamed that I’m terrified that I won’t look the same way, and that I won’t look “healthy” because of lipodystrophy. It seems like a severe and nearly certain side effect of HIV treatment that would make it harder to meet people or hook up. Considering all HIV issues, I never thought I’d be so vain and obsess over this point, but these thoughts are running through my head constantly. 

I'm sorry if I'm being melodramatic or ignorant about anything. I'm a bit shocked myself how little I understand HIV.

There is no actual evidence or research backing it up. They are mostly half truths and exaggerations mostly taken out of some articles wrote by a blogger or these recent crop of 'know it all' writers who will write on everything under the sun from success tips to HIV. By reading those poorly researched blogs people tend to make an opinion trusting the writer, but taking their words for something as serious as HIV which can seriously affect your health and quality of life is just suicidal. Im a physician who provides medications and counseling to HIV patients and i feel that its time to set few things straight(no pun):

1. ""Just get PreP and you can go bareback even with HIV positive""

This is the most often heard advices. PreP here stands for pre exposure prophylaxis. Once a person is confirmed HIV positive (screening followed by confirmatory test), the virus is present in every secretion. The viral load may fluctuate but it never gets zero, so possibility of transmission of virus is never zero. The virus literally gets embedded in your DNA and keeps on copying itself forever. Protected sex is a rule with such person. Risking your life for few moments of bareback pleasure isn't worth it.

2. ""Its just one pill a day, nothing changes""

Sadly yes..it changes a lot. Any drug that directly affects immune system basically alters the way how body reacts to infections. Even taking aspirin over longer periods can cause complications. ART drugs are much ahead toxicity levels than aspirin. And don't forget, the treatment is for lifetime. For example We see more patients of heart complications due to the side effects of anti hypertensive drugs than actual MI. The side effects of ART drugs drastically increase after 5 yerars of treatment which includes chronic diarrhea, liver damage, anxiety, anaemia, cancer. Also consider the medical bills running into thousands of dollars from drugs and investigations.

3. "" Permanent treatment/vaccine is around the corner, so you can chances""

Its almost 40 years since HIV virus was isolated, but we haven't had much success in finding its cure. The reason is the complex structure of this virus which mutates very rapidly. There are now hundreds of various strains of HIV virus as we speak and the number is going to increase in future. Cure could be there in 5 years or may take 40. I won't put a timeline over it. 


Take-home: 

1.  Not to scare away everyone with the ghost of HIV but to educate about the irreversibility and finality of it. Its not all walk in the park kinda thing to be messed around with.

2. To clear the myths around it and promote safe and protected sexual practices. Taking these matters lightly can cause severe psychological,social and health hazards.

3. If in doubt, test it out. And repeat after 3 months. 

4. Dont take anyone's word about their status. Get them tested. 

HIV is not the monster it was 20 years before but it still deserves our attention and prevention. 
People suffering from it deserves our love care and support. But at the same time don't let your gaurd down.

I've been talking to the guy in the comments and he's almost certainly full of shit. 

He's reporting an near impossibly fast-progressing strain of HIV (initial infection to AIDS within 20 days).

This terrifying strain of HIV was then apparently met with a complete lack of curiosity by his doctor, who didn't even bother profiling it for resistance, despite such profiling being usual for even an 'ordinary' HIV infection in the US (he reports being from Colorado).

He then apparently only saw said doctor about it once a year, and *despite two opportunistic infections across three years of full-blown AIDS* it was only when he 'changed doctors' that they noticed that his HIV infection not only wasn't responding to his meds, but didn't respond to any known class of antiretroviral and was accordingly untreatable. And now he's going to die.


I mean, none of this really makes much sense, but a low-rent troll looking for something that is scary and poorly understood immediately leaps to 'super HIV bugchasing mega AIDS death', and the redditors over at /r/confession are eating his story right up (+700 upvotes with 80 comments at the time of posting).

(I'm really hoping ppl don't just freak out and react with ""How dare you even ask the question! Rot in hell!!"" It's a live and real question IMO whose time has come.)"

Just over a month ago I got a severe case of Shingles and as a result I had a STD screening, and the test for HIV came back positive. 

I’m about 20 days into my medication and I understand that my lifespan is unlikely to be unaffected but it’s still an enormous shock to my system. 

I’m also long term unemployed and and on the sick due to a complication from the Shingles called Postherptic Neuralgia. 

So generally things are feeling pretty grim at the moment and I could do with some comfort. I don’t have anyone to cuddle so plenty of cuddles and encouragement from internet strangers is better than nothing, right?

I had unprotected sex with two guys this week, one time I was topping (he also came in my mouth and I unfortunately swallowed) and the second time  we just fooled around (oral, handjob, etc) but he kept on insisting to fuck me, and although I said no, he shoved his dick into my ass. After a few seconds, I pushed him away and he came all over my butthole. 

Anyway, today I have started to get really paranoid. Both guys said they were negative, neither sleep around much. They said I should not worry, but I am just worried that they might not know they are positive or perhaps they lied.

I met up with a doctor today and he tested me, I was negative. But since you all know, it takes a while before accurate results come up. However, after hearing my story, he said that he highly doubted I was infected and that I should not worry. 

What are your opinions? Anything I can do to calm myself, since I have had several panic attacks because of this. I am afraid this will take a toll on my eating disorder and depression. I am so disappointed in myself, as I was finally heading towards a better place in life. "

I wasn’t even thinking about this until a week ago where I watched a show where someone contracts HIV. After that, I started manifesting symptoms.

Slight headache, slight sore throat, rash on the back? I don’t know if that pattern has always been there, my parents keep telling me it has. And some off and on back soreness.

Now I was told by the infectious disease guy at the hospital that by law I have to disclose i am of an uncertain HIV status for the next four months if I have sex without a condom \(not that I think this is a problem I am totally on board with it\) however do I really have to wait 4 months before I know I am HIV free? I have read several places online that within 6 weeks after PEP I should have a very good idea \(95&amp;#37;\) of whether or not I have contracted HIV. His position was that the PEP will block my ability to see if I am HIV positive until 3 months after I finished taking them so there is no point getting a check up in 2.5 months.

Long time lurker here just from browsing online. Decided to create an account to ask some advice. 

Last night, I went on a date with this guy I started speaking to on Tinder. Our conversations just texting and FaceTimeing have been great, and I super liked him in order to get him to notice me so that we’d match, because I thought he was so fucking cute. 

So, we met up at around 1am last night and just spoke on his porch. We then went on a long drive and a walk at a park. We vibe so well. He’s tall, super gorgeous in person, much moreso than his photos, and he kept saying I was adorable. 

However, toward the beginning of the date, he got super nervous and he told me that he wanted to get something off his chest right away, and told me that he is HIV+. He said his viral load is undetectable, and he’s on heavy medication. He educated me on things I already knew. But it was nice to be open and give me a place to ask questions if I wanted. He thought that I was going to drop him off home and that it wasn’t going to work out, but instead, I asked if I could hold his hand. The rest of the night was perfect and we shared such an amazing kiss watching the sun rise. We were literally out until 6am. 

My question for you bros is, do you have any advice/experience with an HIV+ partner? I really really like him a lot. But I’m a super hypochondriac, and it’s my absolute worst fear to get HIV, or even talk about it. But I felt oddly comfortable around him last night and I really like him. I know you can’t get HIV from just touching or kissing, unless you’re both bleeding and have open wounds that touch. Even then, it’s minimal. But I just want to know any good advice. 

It’s greatly appreciated.

Around a year ago he got HIV and it pretty much destroyed our relationship... I thought I had it too. Luckily I didn’t catch anything, but my ex became too bitter about it, we broke up, and I’ve been single ever since.

 u/devestaeted 's story of his ex that just resurfaced on this sub is a harrowing tale, but does make us sit down and think about how people contract the disease in the first place.

I think it does, to be honest, unless it was an accident (eg broken condom) and they took the maximum measure (PeP) to try and prevent infection but it still failed (remmeber PeP does NOT have a 100% success rate, as does Prep).

Some people think PreP is a magic bean that gives them a precedent to have 100% bareback sex, but HIV resistant strains come out and then they're sorry.

It seems like a significant (but not all) number of dudes you see on Grindr where their status is ""Negative on Prep"" = good luck convincing him to have *safe* sex with you because he doesn't see any real need to.

HIV is still a serious, life-changing disease (and it stays with you right until the day you die) irrespective of treatment option. It's not something to be taken lightly."

Yesterday, I was worried about him, and said on snapchat ""You said you usually fuck without condom, but are you sure you're not infected? I don't want you to catch anything"", then went out for shopping. When I went back, I saw he blocked me

So I googled ""How can you transmit HIV"" and saw that it's transmitted by blood, semen, etc - which is quite worrying as although we 100% did it with a condom (I always checked whether it was on, and he did not frot/wouldn't let him frot), I swallowed

A week ago, I did something I've never done before, I hooked  up with a complete stranger, also a guy.  Please forgive me for the  explicit descriptions that will follow:

We  engaged in heavy kissing, mutual oral sex(69) twice for half an hour  each time and rubbed our penises together. I noticed that he was leaking  a lot of precum, which by the way, I kept wiping away every minute or  so with my hand each time I sucked him. I know that these were not very  high risk activities.

Now here's the part  that's causing all this anxiety. After the oral sex, he began to rub  his bare, unprotected penis against my ass. Then, without warning he  momentarily ''dipped'' the head of his penis into my hole. This must  have lasted 5-6 seconds. I immediately moved away his penis with my  hand, telling him he needs to wear a condom. He proceeded to ''dip'' his  penis into my hole again, which prompted me to remove it again and  insist he wear a condom. He eventually put a condom on along with some  lube and fucked me for around 4-5 minutes. At this point he withdrew and  jerked off until he ejaculated on his own chest. There were no visible  signs of blood in or around my anus. But, I've recently learned there  can be micro tears.

I am terrified that  the dipping may have lead to HIV exposure, since during oral he was  leaking so much precum. I asked him twice about his status after we  hooked up. He just keeps saying he gets tested every three months and is  healthy. With no proof of course. He seems like a decent guy but what  worries me is that he mentioned wanting to use poppers before we had  sex(which I refused of course), and the fact he was trying to dip me  twice, I get the feeling he is very promiscuous and indulges in risky sex practices. .

I  am googling HIV risk like crazy for the past 7 days and feel like I'm losing my mind. And I won't know for sure for the next three months. There are apparently many cases of people catching the virus from one exposure. Please, anyone feel free to chime in."

Last night I kissed a guy at a club. He was a flight attendant not from here. I can speak Spanish okay but not perfectly so there were some communication barriers. 

Anyway we kissed a lot and he got a bit ""toothy"" at times - not in a disgusting way but it was a bit ""bitey"" for me. It was a bit intense at some points and I was a bit worried he would draw blood.

At some point kiss I felt like I got a weird taste in my mouth, and worried it could have been blood. I looked in the mirror at the inside of my mouth (bottom lip mostly) and tongue but I couldn't find any signs of bleeding or cuts, even minuscule ones. The weird taste was only for about 2-3 seconds.

I know HIV isn't transmitted through kissing, I have no proof that this guy is HIV positive, no proof of any blood transfer (from him or me) but it did freak me out a bit. Sometimes my gums can bleed when brushing/flossing (the dental hygienist says it's okay).

I am a young gay bro, and I have been sexually active for 2 years (I am legal, don’t worry). But I have always struggled with anxiety. And since I started having sex, this has gotten worse. I am terrified of catching HIV. I had cancer, so the tought of being sick is pretty terrifying to me. It seems like every time I have sex I start becoming extremely paranoid about catching something. I always use condoms (with the exception of one time years ago, but I have gotten test many times since then) but it does not seem to help me with my anxiety. So I’m left in a hard place: either I stop having sex (I tend to go without sex for many months at a time) which is really frustrating, or I do and start obessesing after, going to Google looking for symptoms (I know I shouldn’t, but it makes me feel a little better sometimes) and then convincing myself that I have them, which is also frustrating.

He said he never used a condom in his past relationship which is probably why he couldn't stay hard. I kept insisting on using one though but then he said that he's only ever slept with two people in his life. I was in love and horny so at that point I, like an idiot, said ""okay, duck the condoms and ever since then we've just never used them. Well, I've been piecing together some things today and I've realized four things:

1. Before we had sex he failed to mention that he used to share needles, a lot, to shoot heroin and meth with people back when he was still using.

2. One time he said he was tested for hiv when he was in rehab and that he came out negative, but another time he has also said he has never been tested in his life. I'm not sure what to believe.

3. He told me he has only slept with two people but I've since found out later that there are two other people that he's slept with that I know about and a possible third person he might have slept with that his friend was talking about when telling us a story about his ex and him having a three way. My boyfriend insisted that the story was about his ex and his new boyfriend and that I just heard things wrong but I fucking know I heard that correctly. 

4. His ex used to cheat on him rampantly, which was apparently something that my boyfriend was well aware of the whole time they were dating but he failed to mention that part before we ever had sex.

I know I have my share of blame in this too. I should've been more insistent on using condoms, I was a fucking idiot for not doing that but now, I'm super pissed at my boyfriend for not only possibly exposing me to hiv but also for the rampant lies and not being more upfront with me about his history of drug use and his past sex life. I don't know what to do besides get tested. I love him to bits but I'm pissed he potentially put me at risk.

The test specifies to read the results between 10 and 20 minutes after dropping and mixing the blood with the provided liquid.

Anyways, the results got negative, I read them after 10, 20 and 40 minutes, also, after 2 hours.

Comes the morning, I check the results, and I see both lines showing up, also the results are all stained from blood.

Anyways, I just would like some re-assurance or explanation as to why this happens, and if I should really ignore it.

He even showed me his Truvada pills to ease my worries. Honestly, this guy seemed genuine. I am negative but haven't been tested in over a year (this was my first post-test anal)... and I'm not on Prep. Going to get tested hopefully Wed to get the process re-going, then planning to continue testing to ensure all is good. Probs going to look into Prep too.

Now however we have started to get intimate. Not sex yet but still. He is on his HIV medication and I totally believe him. However I am not planning to do anything until I get a straight answer as my doctor has said even if he is on his medication and is undetectable he can still transfer it. Both the nurses in my family have said not do oral or any sort of sex as it still puts me at risk. Even though both he and a few sources I have found online have said it is not possible to transmit HIV if you are undetectable. Can anyone provide me with a straight answer?

I am 22 years old, and have been sexually active since I was 17. In the past two years, I have not been tested for HIV, which is a stupid decision, I know. 

I normally always wear a condom, when not involved in a monogamous relationship. But there are three occasions in the past two years that I am a little concerned about. 

One was at a gay bathhouse in NYC. I was topping a guy with a condom. At the last minute, I took the condom off to ejaculate and at the last possible second he put my penis back inside, where I ejaculated. 

Another event was with a local guy, who based off of his grindr profile is a frequent bottom. And probably, frequent bareback. I topped him without a condom. 

The only other time was with another local guy, who was discreet. 

In every situation I was the top. and I never noticed symptoms of acute HIV infection. but every time I get a sore throat or illness, my mind automatically goes to HIV. 

I was scared to death to get tested. but yesterday I went to the clinic and they took blood. I will receive my results in the next two days. I've never been more scared in all my life. 

I know its impossible to guess, but do you guys think I have a great cause for concern? I'm just trying to set my mind at ease for the next couple days.

About 6 weeks ago or so I had a sexual encounter with a man I was talking to on Grindr for a little bit. Now from my understanding this man was a lot older than me I am 19 and he 35. I do not mind older or think anything of it. I went to his house after talking for a little bit and performed oral sex...during he was very rude to me though and even went as far to call me a girl when I’m clearly identifying as male. Now normally I wouldn’t worry about hiv especially not through oral but the experience was terrible mid way through I stopped it and left and was scared because he seemed upset. I left and everything seemed fine. I took an hiv test about 4 weeks in and a rna test because I feared that the man being so rude would have no problem giving me anything. What do you guys think? He did not cum or anything I don’t remember tasting precum at all and his dick was quite limp so I’m hoping he couldn’t produce any body fluids lol! But seriously guys do you think I should worry my counselor told me not to because oral was rare to create hiv! Not that Hiv is so horrible but i would hate to get it from such a loser of a person. :( please input anyone! [worried](hello.com)

I'm very, very scared and anxious.I have had 2 ""risky"" encounters that may have lead to potential HIV exposure.

1) Sexual encounter on the 11th of July: Deep kissing, rough frottage, unprotected receptive and insertive oral sex, protected receptive anal sex. However, there was a moment where the was rubbing his unprotected dick against my anus. I was clenching my ass a lot as I felt uneasy because he was leaking a lot of pre-cum earlier. He then tried to insert his penis inside me and I quickly removed it with my hand within about 5 seconds. I'm not sure if there was penetration for sure because I only felt pressure before I removed his dick. Then moments later he tried again, and again I removed his dick after about 5 seconds and made him where a condom. So I'm not sure if I was poked twice or if there was actual dipping for around 10 seconds in total. 

The guy I had sex with got tested 8 days after the encounter and claimed he got a negative result. Eventually he blocked me. I got tested twice with a 4th Generation Rapid Test after this encounter, at 27 days and then 40 days. Both were negative and the doctor was convinced there was no real risk even with possible 10 second dipping. 

2) Sexual encounter on the 4th of September: Deep kissing, light frottage, receptive oral sex ( I wouldn't go down on him without a condom) and unprotected insertive oral sex and no anal sex. However, at one point his unprotected dick was leaking pre-cum and touched the outside of my anus twice. This prompted me to go to another clinic the next day, where the doctor prescribed me PEP and I took the first dose 20 hours after the encounter. 

She ran a PCR HIV test and a full panel for STDs. 

So these are the results I have to collect tomorrow morning only when the doctor is there apparently. The way the lady on the phone asked me to collect the results only when the doctor is there in a serious tone has me reeling. It's too soon for the second encounter to have lead to a positive result so it must be the first encounter.

Please help. I'm feeling so lost and scared.  "

Without getting too into the details, I've recently begun a course of PEP after a potential exposure. I want to understand something about the nature of HIV testing and how the virus develops.

Before receiving any medicine I had some blood drawn and I believe I was told that sample would not be tested on itself, but act as something of a 'baseline' to compare to in the future.

My question is-- if after a course of PEP and after being tested negative at both 4 weeks and 4 months from exposure-- whether it's possible to determine if you were genuinely infected and managed to prevent the virus from taking hold vs. having not actually been infected in the first place.

This leads onto a related question; is that initial blood sample a 'snapshot' in time? Will the virus develop in that blood sample the same way were it to have remained in the body? After 4 weeks, were that blood to contain the virus, would the virus begin to become detectable, or does blood 'die' when removed from the body?

I'd really appreciate any insight into all this to hopefully understand things better."

&gt; In 2016, gay and bisexual men accounted for 67% (26,844) of all HIV diagnoses and 82% of diagnoses among males aged 13 and older.

&gt; A much higher proportion of gay and bisexual men have HIV compared to any other group in the United States. Therefore, gay and bisexual men have an increased chance of having an HIV-positive partner.

&gt; Most gay and bisexual men get HIV from having anal sex without using condoms or taking medicines to prevent or treat HIV. Anal sex is the riskiest type of sex for getting or transmitting HIV. Receptive anal sex is 13 times as risky for getting HIV as insertive anal sex.


How do gay men cope with being the main carriers of the most deadly STD on the planet? Why do bisexual men recklessly endanger the lives of women by having sex with them after having sex with a man, exposing them to risks they wouldn’t face if they were with a straight man?

Do you agree that gay and bisexual men need to be held accountable for the majority of HIV infections? Are you taking the steps to ensure you aren’t spreading your HIV everywhere? "

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously hiv is a terrible disease that has no cure yet. Nobody will wanna come in contact with it, even though modern medicine made it no longer a death sentence, it is still up there as one of the worst diseases.

And it just happens to directly spread from our favorite thing: sex. How fucking great.

After a few searches, I have learned that apparently the odds of getting hiv from sexual contact are very low, yet they go up rapidly if certain conditions are met, however this is from an article that was back in 2014.

The way I understood hiv, like all virus, starts growing once came in contact within your body, but for it to be enough that you can detect if through blood test, it needs a couple of weeks. As of 2018 we know that if your hiv virus load is undetectable, you're relatively healthy as long as you take prescribed medicine everyday until the drug stops working, in which case you're fucked and basically faces your doom - a very, very painful and slow death.

Nobody wants that happen to them, that's for sure.

&amp;#x200B;

The risk of getting hiv lives with us everytime we have sex, but at the end of the day, the odds are fucking pointless. If you come in contact with somebody hiv positive (which means they have a high enough viral load for it to be detectable), and their blood, precum of semen successfully contacts your blood some how, you're fucked no matter what. The odds are just out of the window.

From the information I have gathered, here's a sum up of daily anti-hiv 101:

1 Oral sex without a condom is safe, as long as you don't have any issues in your mouth or throat where the precum and cum can get in contact.

2 For anal sex, always use a condom when dealing with strangers that you're not clearly sure they're hiv negative or undetectable. 

Hiv undetectable doesn't mean 'oh I mean he LOOKS like he doesn't have hiv, so it's undetectable'. It just means the viral load is low, but a person can look perfectly healthy with a high viral load in early stages of hiv. Hiv targets the immune system, and it's the other shit that attacks our body that makes hiv the vicious killer it is. The only way to know for sure is to get a blood test, and let them show you the receipt that says they're clean.

This also applies to somebody in a relationship with you. Do not perform sex without a condom with your 'long term sexual partner' unless you're COMPLETELY SURE they're clean. No relationships are worth the risk your own life, and if your partner can't understand that, maybe you need a new one. 

A ton of hiv carriers got it from their 'relationship partner', in truth, nobody knows what the person you trust and loves the most do everyday, if anything the longer you guys are in a relationship the more likely he is secretly having sex with someone else. I hate to break it to you but that's just how relationships work, you get bored of each other eventually because the chemistry (literally) of hormone ends. That's just how our body work.

3 IF the need rises, that you absolutely have to perform unsafe anal sex as a bottom with another person because the heart wants what it wants and condom ruins the fun of sex, use enough lube to make sure that you don't get injuries during his pounding. I hope this is simple enough to understand.

4 Taking PrEP is important if you're very sexually active and frequently changes your partner, it helps reducing the risk of getting hiv exceptionally. Taking pills might be annoying, but again, nothing is worth risking your own life.

5 The earlier you get tested, the better. Like any other disease, hiv is easier to control when caught early, as soon as the window phase passes. Hiv is a deadly disease, but you can still have quality life as long as you're taking the right medicines everyday to control your viral load.

Performing high risk sexual actives and not getting tested is literally regarding your own life as a joke, remember, even if you get diagnosed it's not the end of the world. Take a deep breath and think about where this is gonna go, there's always hope as long as your life continues. There maybe a cure developed within 10 years. You never know. Maybe we all die from a nuclear war in the next decade. Again, you never know the future, giving up is the worst thing you could do to yourself.

Now, what I wanted to ask is.

Throwaway account and just wanted to get the jitters and anxiety out. I don't have any gay friends so I don't feel like I have the support system to talk about this off line and in person.

Anyways, I hooked up with this guy first week of September. I told him to use a condom for anal and I saw him grab one and put it on. Then we took a break and were going to continue to do anal. I asked if he had a condom on, he grabbed one. For a few moments while he was inside, maybe 2 minutes, I had some doubts and had a feeling the second time he didn't use a condom though I had no visual confirmation. I called it quits right then and there and left. He didn't cum inside or anything. 

Paranoid in general and wanting to get a good base line, I tested negative using OraQuick (September 23).  However, last week I experienced some symptoms (4 weeks after hooking up) I would say would be the common cold. This was the same time it also became colder where I lived so I wasn't sure if it was because of weather change or someone sick with the common cold at work. October 2, sore throat but cleared up by October 3.  Still have some post nasal drip up to today (October 9). Otherwise, nothing is out of the ordinary. 

I want to take another OraQuick test but I don't think after 4 weeks it would give me that accurate of a result. Anyone been in a similar situation? I plan on getting tested again at the 3 month mark (merry Christmas to me).

He's not a bug chaser, but he certainly gets a thrill out of it.

I have mistaken his recklessness and his care-free attitude for support and acceptance. This now more than ever proves to me how much our personalities are incompatible.

I've been meeting some guys last year but haven't done any penetrations yet. I'm only into foreplay and giving blowjobs and that's about it. I had my HIV test last January this year and ended up with a negative result. But my horniness led me to playing with another guy just right before the day i got my result (but again, no penetrations but no blowjobs that time. Just a lot of licking and foreplay and dry humping.)

But after doing it, the guy went to the bathroom to wash and started coughing so hard and that made me uncomfortable. I am thinking that his horniness really just made him do what we did, and went back to his self after ""coming"" and just want to ""cough it out"". Me being an overthinker, has been thinking about this that maybe he has that, he has this,  since that day and never had any sexual play with anyone since then just to be safe.

And last month, I met my boyfriend (long distance relationship). We are so happy and we do our best all the time and we are going to meet for the first time next month (Wish us luck!). 

Recently, i got some allergy reactions too.  Aside from the itchy allergies I would normally get from chicken or dust, I would often get red spots around my body as well from time to time, and I am worried that this might be something because of what I did last January and just appearing now, maybe because I have an active lifestyle?  Already went to the doctor, and was under medication for almost 2 months now. As this became recurring (which made me more uncomfortable that this may be from HIV or anything), we did more allergy exams last week and other blood tests and we're still waiting for the results which i will get today hopefully. Doctor told me not to worry, but I do. I do not have any other symptoms of HIV tho, and it's been 9 moths now after the incident happened. 

But i just want peace of mind before I meet my boyfriend and I want to do this for myself and for him. When I called the hospital, they told me there are regular HIV test and other STD testing where it will have a series of tests.  Should I just go for the regular HIV test?

Bros, these may sound a bit shallow minded but I hope you can help me ease my mind.

The main reason why I'm looking for advice is because I'm really struggling with depression due to being HIV+. I've been having suicidal thoughts recently, and just feel hopeless overall. I barely leave my house and sleep almost all day (I am unemployed and will start a new job soon). The only times I leave my house is when I go out to drink, because drinking used to take my mind off things but now it's kind of having the opposite effect. A couple of weeks ago, I told a group of friends and family about my diagnosis, I was drunk out of my mind and had a breakdown. They were supportive, thankfully. But I had another breakdown recently (also while drunk), and I basically threatened to kill myself. I guess my friends had never been in a similar situation and didn't know how to handle it? They just kind of shrugged it off and said that I was just too drunk and to get over my disease. I haven't spoken to them ever since because I feel ashamed and embarrassed about the whole situation, but the depression keeps drilling into my head. The worst part is that there are no support groups, or suicide prevention line where I live (I tried talking to a psychologist but didn't help, and I don't want a psychiatrist to prescribe meds). I feel that talking about it would help, but it just feels weird to talk about it with my parents, you know? They would be devastated and I don't want to be a burden to them. 

I don't know guys, I just feel like I'll grow old and die alone, I haven't dated or had sex since I got the HIV diagnosis. I'm an atheist but sometimes I just lay in bed and wonder if life starts over when you die, you know? Man, it all sounds so pathetic now that I'm writing about it, but this is the closest I have to talking to someone (just put it on the internet, right? Lol) Has anyone here been through a similar situation? I think that reading about others' experiences might help and give me some ideas on how to overcome this. I do want to overcome it, there's this little part of me that wants to be happy again.

Anyway, sorry for the long post, too much stuff going through my head at the moment. I'll appreciate any advice/reply, and I'm open to questions. Thanks!"

The sexual encounter occurred on the 4th of September. There was deep kissing, light frottage, protected receptive oral sex (I wouldn't go down on him without a condom) and unprotected insertive oral sex and no anal sex. However, at one point his unprotected dick was leaking pre-cum and touched the outside of my anus twice. He also eventually ejaculated eventually on his own chest. He wiped it away with some tissues. The cum soaked tissues, 4 minutes later I accidentally stepped on with my bare feet, picked up with my hands to dispose of and then accidentally touched my eye. The pre-cum thing and cum soaked tissues prompted me to go to a clinic the next day, where the doctor prescribed me PEP and I took the first dose 20 hours after the encounter. "

Sunday night I had a regrettable encounter with a young guy.  He was grinding on me when all of a sudden he came all over my asshole.  There was no penetration, but I’m immediately pissed as seconds before I told him to knock it off.

I chew him out and inquire about his status.  He says he was tested around 6 months ago and had only been with a few guys since, no bareback.  He is a young African American male which is a bad statistic.  I convince myself the risk is relatively low since there was no penetration and I rinsed off immediately.  I do have a hemorrhoid/fissure which was not open or anything, but I decide his risk profile is low and I dismiss getting pep.

Fast forward 6 days on Saturday night, I feel awful.  All of a sudden I have chills, sweats, swollen lymph nodes.  Other than it’s less than one week after, most websites say 2, I’m convinced I’ve contracted HIV from the worst encounter of my life now (8 days after exposure).

It seems like I shouldn’t bother with a test until 2 weeks out.  Is there anything else I can do to put my mind at ease?  Am I overreacting?  I’m too old for this shit, I grew up when AIDS was still killing people, etc and should know better.

I think I’m actually bi but can’t deny I like having sex with guys.

It fucking sucks and I know it’s borderline homophobia but it’s just how i feel. Obviously straight people can get AIDS but the prevalency is so much higher among gay men that it feels like the “dirty” sexuality in my fucked up head. 

Not sure what I’m asking for, prepared for an unwelcome response to this view as it ignores all the progress we’ve made, how HIV isn’t a “death sentence” anymore, and it isnt, but it still feels that way to me. If I had HIV i’d obsess over to the point of hysteria, I’d literally rather die. Again, sorry, but it’s how I feel. And I’ve researched this topic to death so no statistic (that I’ve likely already seen) can change this perspective.

Being monogamous would obviously be one solution, but it feels so much harder to reach that point with gay men. And my mind comes up with the idea that even if I was monogamous, I can’t trust anyone and my partner might be cheating on me, or lying about his status, or unaware of his status.

I purchased a home test kit for HIV with my blood as the needed sample. 

  
My last exposure was on July 2018. It was a hookup with somebody I didn't know if poz or not. I didn't asked. I just went nuts to experience gay sex for the first time. After that, we were both sick with a flu so bad I have to get a z-pak through a doctor. Though we used condoms, I have a gum sore that I suspected to become a possible entry point. 

  
Then months later, I felt weaker. I skipped gym (which is very unusual since I workout 5 times a day), then I'm losing weight though I'm on a keto diet for quite some time. Then I googled everything about the disease and I felt shit scared, so scared of dying and not just about it but the usual social stigma. 

  
Then recently, I decided to buy the test kit. I don't want to be tested in health clinics. I'm too concerned about my privacy.  I pricked myself, bled, and put two drops of it in the cassette. The test kit looks like a pregnancy test. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then after 15 minutes. A strong red line appeared. One red line. Negative. 

I looked for the box. It said even a faint second line appears, it is considered positive. 

I looked at it again. No faint line. Only one strong line. 

I felt happy and sad at the same time. Happy that I'm not poz while sad that I really have to get this far to be not careful. 

&amp;#x200B;

Why am I saying all of this? I want others also to be inspired to get tested. Even if it's at home and you're brave enough to do the procedures, why not? Give it a try to know your status. And as I read, the sooner you get help if tested poz, the better chances of support you'll get.

I had protected anal sex about 6 weeks ago (I was the top). all went fine, we were at it for an hour until I finally came whilst inside him (with the condom still on of course). I don’t think the condom was broken or had any kind of hole in it (I definitely hope it didn’t!) he sucked me off before we fucked and we kissed throughout the whole thing. 

Halfway through, we changed the condom and this is what’s making me paranoid. I literally CANNOT remember if it was the extra condom that I had carried with me or if it was one which he had lying around. My brain fog is so bad I literally cannot remember! 

Anyway, when I pulled out of him at the end, my cum was still in the condom and didn’t look like it had leaked anywhere. 

Fast forward two weeks, and I come down with a mild soreness in my throat, some congestion and a headache which worsened in 2 days and was gone by the 4th day. I noticed during the first two nights, I would wake up in the early hours of the morning feeling damp. Not soaked or anything but a little bit sweaty. Especially my lower back and the back of my neck. (Note: the season has changed and it is now winter so the heating in my house has been cranked up).

I started panicking and was convinced I was going through seroconversion. Anyway, after the 4th day, my symptoms were gone and I was no longer waking up feeling moist. I felt fine. 

Now, it’s been 4 weeks since this occurrence and I woke up on Wednesday feeling okay. I showered in the afternoon and soon after I had dried myself, my throat felt a little sore. Later on in the day, I began having symptoms of post-nasal drip and my throat felt worse. I woke up on Thursday morning and Friday morning at around 5ish, feeling a little bit sweaty and I’ve had this annoying dry cough for 3 days now! 

Similar to most people, I’ve been googling my symptoms and have been scaring myself as sore throat and “night sweats” match with the symptoms of acute HIV infection. 

Just want to know if any of y’all have had a similar experience because I just find it weird how I’ve gotten sick again within a space of 3 weeks! I know it’s flu and cold season due to the weather being cold and the air being dry but it’s just making me paranoid! "

Do you get it’s literally because blacks are a minority and because there such a small percentage of blacks in America compared to whites that’s why it’s most likely for a black person to have it because it’s spread in that group because blacks stick to their own. 

I also read that black gay and bisexual men are more likely to have HIV from white men or Hispanic once again because of the number of blacks in America that date in their race meaning it can be spread in the group mainly.

Afterwards, I checked out his profile again - send that customary 'Thank you!' message, help with the post-act good feelings. I click in on his profile picture (him and his long-time BF, in an open relationship)  only to catch that spooky-ass Biohazard sign tattooed on his wrist. Didn't notice it before, IRL or when chatting. Their profile says Negative, and when asked he said that he worked in a lab and got it because he thought that icon is cool.   


I know that (non-swallowing, especially!) oral sex is very low rate of transmission (although, fuck, those light teeth marks down below do not make me feel better about it) , I know that law here is 100% firm on you having to tell about your status beforehand unless your doctor has given the go-ahead that you're a 0% infection chance and that even if he has it and is lying he's very likely on treatment, anyway - but something just feels \*fucking sketchy\* about all of this.

If you live anywhere in the free Western World and have internet access you have an inexhaustible wealth of information at your fingertips. I’ll give a pass to anyone living in 3rd world counties - but the rest of you have NO EXCUSE!

Having sex brings some of life’s greatest pleasures but also comes with risk. Risks can be mitigated, but never 100% eliminated, unless you are celibate your entire life. 

So, before you have sex, do the following:

1) Read. Go to CDC.gov, go to AmericanSexualHealthAssociation.org, or a thousand other sites. Get the facts, symptoms and knowledge about all types of sexual diseases. Make sure you are at reliable sites. Some Christian Church site probably isn’t going to give you accurate and unbiased information. 

2) Visit your doctor, LGBTQ center or Planned Parenthood, or NHS if outside US. 

Tell your doctor you want to be active. Women having sex with men should strongly consider getting anti pregnancy contraceptives. Men in hetro relationships should know about what the women are on and the health risks are to her, along with pregnancy risks. 

I encourage everyone to get on PREP.  Condoms fail. You may think you are in committed relationship, and they cheat. Through many organizations in US, you can get free. Through health plans and Pfizer, you can get co-pay assistance cards. NHS in many countries outside US, are starting to offer PREP. 

Also, set up your regular appointments and testing schedule. If on PREP they test your kidneys every 3 months to make sure your body is tolerating and no damage. But you should be tested for all the other STI’s as well. If you don’t do PREP, you still should be tested for other STIs regularly. 

Anyone under 26, it is recommended you get HPV vaccine if you have not already contracted the HPV virus. 

Everyone should get meningitis vaccine. I would encourage everyone, but especially anyone performing oral/anal sex get Hepatitis vaccine regime (usually 3 shots spaced out)

If you can’t, in my opinion you are not old enough and/or mature enough to have sex. You must be responsible for protecting yourself and making sure you don’t get something that can have life long or life ending consequences because you were too afraid or embarrassed to get treatment. 

If you are afraid of your parents or other people find out you have a STI, you are not ready. You need to be prepared to be an adult, admit you had sex, and need medical care. Many untreated STI have impact on sexual and overall health if left unchecked. 

ALSO, if you slept during sex Ed class or it wasn’t offered, do some research. You should first do some education on your own sex gender. Know how your own body works. If you are attracted to opposite sex, learn how their bodies work and absolutely certain you know how babies are made!

3) Play with yourself. You should to know before hand what you like and don’t like, as much as possible. You can get pretty far with just your fingers. Get some toys. Take your body for some trial runs. This also serves to help you know other things? As you rub caress your nipples/breaths or testicles, you should also check for lumps. Catching cancer early is your best chance for a cure. 

4) Hygiene. I hate to have to cover the basics, but wash your body thoroughly with soap. Use deodorant prior to going on date. Although if you are showering and then jumping straight into bed, don’t worry about it. 

If you are going to give oral sex, don’t brush your teeth within and hour prior or hour after sex. Microscopic cuts from your toothbrush can allow disease to pass in. Use Listerine mouthwash. Proven to help reduce disease. 

Don’t kiss/have sex if you or partner have open soars, bumps or unexplained rashes. I say unexplained, someone who has Psoriasis may have a bad rash, but is not contagious. 

If you are having anal sex, learn how to prepare. Again, do some research on the internet!

Trim your fingernails. Sharp nails hurt sensitive sexual glands. Don’t forget about your toenails. 

Right before you get busy, you should both wash your hands! Don’t need to introduce ‘extra’ bacterial or viral things into the mix. Takes two seconds!

Also, skip the perfume/cologne. Many people are allergic. Your clean body and pheromones will be pleasing enough. 

5) Make sure the space you are going to have sex is safe, clean and conducive to sex. Seems simple, but if don’t have to worry someone is going to walk in or something else, you will have a much better time. 

6) Are you emotionally ready? Either one of you can decide it isn’t for you. They may not be interested afterward. Are you prepared to say NO, if the other tried something you don’t want or hurts?

Have you talked about STIs ahead of time? What precautions have you each taken and what are each of your limits? Have you both learned what “consent” is? Make sure you both give consent before you get started, and check in frequently throughout sex. 

Also, if opposite sexes are involved, what are you going to do if an accidental pregnancy occurs? Will you both support baby? Adoption? Abortion. AFTER THE FACT IS NOT THE TIME!

Tell your closest confident where and whom you are going to be with and for how long. Especially if cases of hook-ups. My bestie and I have an unspoken rule. We text each other these details. Nothing else needs to be said, but there is someone who knows just in case!

7) Pornos are a lie. Don’t try to make like them or live up to those expectations! (At least until you have been around the block a few times, even then, hard to pull off.)

8) Laws. Check about the laws about sex in the country you are about to have sex. Some ultra religious based countries have arrested straight couples for kissing on the beach. Are both individuals of legal age? You may love them, but if you are 17, they are 18, even though you gave consent, your parents could charge them with abuse of a minor if they ever found out. It might be better to wait. Are you gay/lesbian/bi/trans/queer? You should check before you even travel to a country. Some countries can refuse entry to “deviants” or sentence you to death for homosexual acts. You can also be refused lodging, etc. 

9) If you can do all the above, plus some I’ve probably forgotten. Go find that other consenting adult and have the time of your life! Have the dirtiest, sexiest, most amazing time. 

But, one more thing...

10) Rape &amp; sexual assault. Even if you plan on being celibate. Female. Male. Gay. Straight. Bisexual or other. Old. Young. Rich. Poor. Religious or Non-religious. It can happen anywhere, anytime, anyplace.  

First know it is NEVER your fault. There shouldn’t be shame, so seek out the trustful person who can help you get through it. 

Seek medical care immediately. PEP vaccine can be administered within 72 hours and greatly reduces the chances of of HIV transmission. This is what they give doctors/nurses who are accidentally pricked or cut during medical procedures. 

Seek out our law enforcement. (But take heed of #8, if in certain countries). Stand up for your rights, prevent them from hurting others. "

I'm here seeking a little advice minus the disrespect and hostility. Let me explain. I created a post earlier today. My intent was to help people, but I'm getting a lot of backlash. People are being pretty rude and I'm surprised, because it wasn't the reaction I expected. My post was about PrEP and the importance of continuing to wear a condom and for some reason, that triggered a lot of people and I'm confused as to why. I would really appreciate it if someone could NICELY explain to me what I did wrong and why exactly did my post trigger so many. I'm not playing dumb here, I honestly don't know. In my post, I said 6 people who have complied with PrEP have become infected with HIV and that being on PrEP does not make you bulletproof and that condoms should still be applied for safety purposes. That's the short version of my post. I just want to know where I went wrong so I'm more careful in the future, but unfortunately, I cannot get that information from my usual sub because everyone there is being very rude and aggressive. I'm not a rude or aggressive person so I don't want to deal with all of that. I tried to do something I thought was kind and everyone is chewing my head off. I am thinking about removing the post to stop the madness, but I'm coming here first in hopes of answers. Please clue me in if you can. Thank you."

I had protected sex with a man last night. I had blisters on my lips from biting them a lot. I made out with the man and gave him oral sex although no semen touched my lips. I know that he got tested for HIV a couple of months ago and was HIV negative. I also had protected sex with him. No semen of his touched me. But I am concerned if I might get HIV from him. Is there any chance where I will catch a disease from him?

I know this might be a bit of a longer read, but I I feel a bit left alone and don’t think I can talk to about this with any of my friend yet. I would appreciate it if you could spare the time. Then again, I think it might also just be good to get this off my chest in general.

Currently I’m having a friend with benefits (I’ll call him Alex), who’s hardly ever had random hookups with strangers and almost only sex with people he knows well, being very safe all the time. Last week, he had a little HIV scare himself, as he had a friend over from another country. He thought that his (HIV positive) friend (let’s call him Kyle) was on PEP to the extent that it was undetectable, and dipped his dick into him 2-3 times during foreplay before putting on a condom. Afterwards, the Kyle explained to him that Alex misunderstood. Kyle has been on PEP for only 2 months, and that his last test a month ago showed that he wasn’t fully undetectable yet. 
Now, being scared himself Alex went to the sexual health clinic straightaway and got himself on PEP. 

Forward four days to now, Alex and I went for a dinner date and end up at his place. We were considering having sex with a condom and eventually did. Now, foolish me (I bottomed) thought it was a good idea that I liked the feeling of having him in me after he came...which resulted in him getting soft enough that the condom remained inside me after he pulled out after about 2 minutes. His dick is quite big, so I actually couldn’t reach it with my fingers and had to squat and squeeze to get it out. 

Obviously Alex and I were pissed off from the moment where we couldn’t find the condom, and we decided that it would be best for me to beseech the emergency center at the local hospital to get myself on PEP.  I’ve had a blood test taken and according to the nurse I’ll most probably get prescribed PEP, I’ll probably know more in the next few hours. 

Now, to conclude my thought process about getting infected - Afaik, people that are on PEP become undetectable after 2-3 months of treatment. Then, Alex was topping Kyle and only dipped his penis into him 2-3 times without a condom. Additionally, Alex himself is now on PEP. And now, I’ll be on PEP myself. l for the next few months. In my books, I’d say I’d have to overcome a lot of odds to be actually HIV positive myself. I don’t to panic and lose sleep over it, but at the same time I don’t think it’s wise to be too chill about it either. What are your experiences with this kind of stuff, and what do you think?"

Hi 'yall,

I'm here looking for someone to calm my nerves really.

In the first week of September I had unprotected anal sex (receiving). In the first week of November I completed a postal STD check, which included a blood sample (from the finger).

Though the result did come back positive for gonorrhoea, and I am having treatment, it came back negative for HIV.

However, I've had a sore throat for the last two weeks (not bad just itchy). I have had several cases of tonsillitis over the last 2 years, so could be that.

However, I'm getting very anxious about the possibility of contracting HIV. I have contacted my sexual partner, and they have said their last test was in July and it was all clear."

He then tried to penetrate me without a condom and I was immediately taken aback and turned off by that since we barely knew each other so I ended our brief hookup there. He told me he's STD free and on PREP but I really don't think I can trust him after trying to penetrate me without a condom because I'm most likely not the only person he's done this with. This happened about 3 weeks ago and since then I've been tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia and both came back negative. Is a HIV test necessary? I haven't showed any symptoms of an STD but just curious.

We had an amazing time together cuddling and all that I've basically never felt comfortable doing with anyone from grindr ever. He came over again today and we did some stuff. I gave him a bj and then he wanted to top me. I've basically never bottomed but stupidly enough, I didn't care since this was the first guy I've felt comfortable with from that app. I know it's ridiculous since I don't even know him. In fact, we're both in a way very discreet, not even sharing our names and stuff. And he doesn't live here anyway. He's flying back home to his state tomorrow.

When I say I bottomed, I mean that maybe an inch or two of him penetrating me, it was waaaay to painful and not to mention my brain not being able to relax because I knew I was doing something wrong since we didn't have a condom. We tried for a minute or two like that where he took the top of the penis out and in. And then I got irritated with myself for even taking such a risk, not knowing the guy like that so we stopped. He's one of those with a lot of pre-cum and honestly, I'm worried! What are the chances? Should I get PEP at the lgbt center tomorrow or am I just too worried? I don't wanna take any risks and usually I'm so good with condoms when I top. I can't believe myself! I asked him about his stats and he said he's clean but he was just so okay with doing without condom and something was off about him when he was responding to his stats. or not off, but he was so carefree about it. Like he just doesn't give a fuck. And that got me worried too. And this was in the middle of the act and that's when I just stopped.

What would you do if this was something that happened to you???"

Another date we went to the gym and had some good workout, lots of laughs etc. After working out, we were together alone and I felt that I needed to tell him about my status since my feelings for him are getting stronger. I was so scared and about to cry, I told him and he was very cool, I asked him if he knew what Undetectable is and he told me everything (U=U) , seems like he's educated about it, maybe because majored in science??? He said ""It's ok, I really want to be with you"", then asked me how I got it, etc etc, but still he didn't act bad at all.

I was previously on PREP but my prescription ran out 2 days before I hooked up with him, and I just got my refill yesterday. So I'm not sure if the PREP was fully out of my system or not by the time I hooked up with him. Probably was. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm fucking terrified. Gosh I wish I refilled my PREP on time. What is my risk? I'm reading online that since he's healthy and undetectable then by CDC guidlines he is virtually untransmittable. Is this a true statement?

 We have older teens and even college aged guys thinking they got HIV from getting a bj or having someone cum in their mouth.  They have no resources or education on High risk vs low risk activities.  No idea that a regular testing schedule is need when you are sexually activity or where to get said test.

More than 6 weeks ago, I stupidly agreed to sex without a condom. I was the top. The guy assured me he was HIV negative, and that he got tested very regularly, the last being October 2018 (we met at the end of November 2018). Before that, the last time I had sex was a month ago, and I used a condom.

3 weeks later a notice an ulcer on my foreskin. After ignoring it for a week, I went to get tested. Turns out I contracted Syphilis. I have since learnt that Syphilis greatly increases the chance of catching HIV. Due to some past problems with penicillin, the doctor put me on a 4 week course of oral antibiotics. The ulcer has since healed. I have not had sex with anyone since.

2 days ago, I woke up with a mildly sore throat, some aching muscles, a fever and some lethargy. In the days leading up to that I had been getting terrible sleep, averaging less than 5 hours a day. It is also winter where I am right now. The fever broke almost immediately, and after one sluggish day (which even then I was able to get around my daily life without much problem), I felt that I recovered fully. Today, while showering, I noticed some slight redness around my chest area. Very faint, but definitely there. Having showered in the morning as well, I am certain it was not there earlier. 

Could what I said above be symptoms of HIV seroconversion?

So he was topping and bottoming all night. While I unfortunately sat in the corner with my dick in my hand because I was suffering from some form of e.d. It wasn't nerves, maybe to much alcohol over the weekend, I don't know, but we'll get back to that. So this guy fucked/got fucked by like 10 guys that night. All raw. When I tell you this guy is nasty. Atm(ass to mouth) not just his, any guys ass. Sucked every dick. Almost all came in him. He came in a few. He had some much cum in him he kept going to the bathroom to push it out. It was a real life porn. That was Sunday. The following day I was looking at myself in the mirror when I noticed something on my penis. Didn't look right, did some googling and came to the reasonable conclusion I might have chlamydia. Went to the doctor the next day and got on some antibiotics. Now I didn't think to immediately tell this guy about the std. I didn't think to do it until yesterday. Told him, he thank me. Asked him about our plans two weeks out, no reply, as usual. He's very antisocial unless its sex, which is why he wears a mask I guess. About that, he wears a mask ever time he has sex. I know what he looks like, but no one else he has sex with does. Cut to last night. A friend I haven't seen in awhile hit me up to hang out. Now I haven't been able to get it up all week. So I didn't go over with the intention to have sex, nor did he indicate that he wanted too, as we don't always have sex when hang out. So we're over his house and after awhile he did let me know he was in the mood. [I tell him about the std.](m.imgur.com/1Muv4yA,ZXTO4ZY) I also told him about the e.d. Didn't seem worried about either. So, not thinking he can get me hard, as I haven't been able to all week, I let him try. He gets it hard! Now I know you're not supposed to have sex when you take the meds, but I didn't think it would happen and when it did, it never cross my mind to stop. I was fixed on my now working dick. Had a great orgasm. I head home. Get a text from a fb wanting to come over. Tell him the same thing, get the same reply. Hes also brings a friend. I ask did know, he knew. They were also able to get me hard. Had a great orgasm. So I tweet my night out and go to sleep. When I wake up, I see he responded, but when I try to see it, it say I'm blocked. I go into another account and go to his page. He tweeted, ""y'all be safe out here ppl knowingly spreading shit."" ???? What? Are you fucking kidding me? You fucked 10 complete fucking strangers while hiv+ positive and your gonna judge me about knowingly passing shit? The audacity! Look, I'm not gonna sit here and try to front like this lifestyle is safe. I know its not have accepted that I may face consequences for it. But I'm not naive about it either. Just by virtue of having unprotected sex im knowingly spreading around STDs. Facts! And anybody that thinks differently is either naive or a fool. But I'm also not going to judge someone for having sex while having an std in this lifestyle. I mean, that shit comes with the territory. I know most will judge us on our lifestyle choices.

I'm HIV+ for about 2 years, I'm 29, and my viral level is 0.  
I also have a very thin body, like twink, and I carry the stigma that anyone who sees me will think that I'm HIV+.  
I know this is a problem inside my head, but I can't deal with it.   
My Self steem is low sometimes, i have high and lows of it, and I'm having trouble to date someone, even if the guy likes very thin man.   
In this world where bears and gym guys have been very trending I feel very out of place with my body and my HIV status.

I know maybe a Psycologist should be a better bet for me, but I feel I just need to feel comfortable in my skin and I don't know the way to do it.  
My Sexual life is a mess, and I really think this a very import part of our lives, but even if I meet a nice guy I don't feel 100% relaxed to make sex cause of my body type.  
Maybe i need to keep away from any dating apps, cause they seem to  strengthen the feeling of my body being strange for others, cause all they want is a perfect body and a big dick. 

Even stop watching porn coulb be a good thing, cause we started to build a perfect ""body pattern"" in mind .

  
Any sugestion how to deal with this problem? 

Any of you are still trying to feel comfortable with your bodies?

I have hypogammaglobulinemia which produced false negative HIV tests leading me to believe I was able to have unprotected sex with my parter. I need help. I don’t know what to think or do. 

I’m 22 my girlfriend is 19

August 6th 2017 I met up with a Tinder girl at her apartment. We drank and I got way more drunk than I normally do. All I remember is waking up the next morning on her couch with my belt undone and my penis had the after sex / body fluid smell. At this moment I knew something wasn’t right because I always wear condoms with randoms. I also didn’t feel hungover which means I didn’t drink as much as I thought I did. I was freaked out because I thought I was drugged so I left and got a ride home from my friend. After this I couldn’t come to grips that I as a man may have been raped. I didn’t really think heterosexual rape could happen to a guy. How can a small girl take advantage of me? 

August 20th 2017 is when I believe I seroconverted. From the 20th onward till now I’ve been fatigued and had gastrointestinal issues, I have a lot of loose stools. 

October 23rd 2017 I tested negative on a 4th generation test and I was deemed conclusively negative by an infectious disease specialist because I didn’t test positive for antibodies or antigens. 

In between December 31st  and January 7th I had another negative HIV test. That is around 2 years after exposure. Around this time I was having unprotected sex with my girlfriend, including me ejaculating in her. After I started ejaculating in her she got violently for 2 days then stayed sick with a cold for a week. I believe this was her seroconversion. 

A few days ago I was tested for hypogammaglobulinemia and I have it. I do not produce enough antibodies which cause me to be susceptible to bacterial and fungal infections. This also causes HIV false negative antibody tests. I got diagnosed with hypogammaglobulinemia and HIV in the same week. The tested me for HIV in my DNA instead of antibodies and I tested positive. 

I don’t know how to tell my 19 year old girlfriend that I think I gave her HIV because I was raped and that I have hypogammaglobulinemia and it caused my HIV test to be a false negative which put her at risk. 

Our relationship is still young but I love this girl and she’s going to hate my guts. Her parents will hate my guts. She will probably avoid all contact with me. We’re both from white middle class families in USA. We’re both in the lowest risk group for HIV. This is way too much to handle I just feel like disappearing. I can understand me having HIV but why did I have to have a rare disease that made me put her at risk for HIV? I fear her parents, I’m a good person but I have so much guilt.

I had sex with a guy a month ago and we became a fwb-type of relationship except he has a lot of emotional attachment to me. We talk a lot.

I asked him for his status before meeting and he said he is negative for everything. He kept mentioning bareback and I declined that offer. I only rubbed his hole with my dick and the rest was oral. 

A few days ago, I learned that he has HIV. He posted publicly about it online years back. I was shocked when I saw that. He wrote how he doesn't like traditional medicine and all that, so I assume that he doesn't take medication for his HIV. I did some more digging and he has so many online dating profiles, having ""don't ask, don't tell"" when listing his HIV status.

I just got tested and will see the full results next week. I tested HIV- for the instant test, but that is irrelevant since we had sex a month ago and not 3+. I've been really sick for the past week and the 4 week mark has passed since when we had sex.

I've been stressing myself over my sickens because I think I got infected. It's such a weird sickness and I know that this isn't your common cold or flu. 

Should I confront this guy? How should I do it? It is illegal in my country to not disclose your HIV status before having sex. "

What do you think? Is it possible? SoTU speeches are always full of pie-in-the-sky promises (regardless of presidents), so I'm skeptical.  I work in public health.  If the federal government put a bunch of money into expanding access to PreP and evidence-based sex education, we'd for sure make a significant dent in the number of new infections, but there's bound to be a bunch of conservative resistance to those strategies.

I don’t remember having cuts or sores in my mouth as well.
3 days ago, meaning 25 days post exposure had a 4th gen test (antibodies + antigenes) which turned out negative but I don’t know if it’s too soon or can it be considered a good indicator.
Regarding symptoms, don’t have flu nor fatigue or fever. What I do have are some red spots (bubbles in my chest and back, two or three in my arms) - I do jiu-jitsu so sweat a lot and have high impact sport, additionally I have very sensitive skin and had quite aggressive acne when was young which I don’t know if can explain it.
Tried to educate myself and understand the low possibilities of HIV happening through oral transmission, still my mind says I’m positive and on the process of seroconverting. Can’t sleep or work and just want to be alone, I’m isolating myself from everybody and if I’m positive I can only think of suicide.
Just want to hear someone’s thoughts..

Straight to the point. I received a blowjob (without protection) from a sex worker August 11th. I took a Western Blot test 15 days later and it came back negative (0,11 non-reactive). The doctor said that I should take another test a few months later. So I took. Here's the dates and the results:

10/15/2018 - 0,13 non-reactive.

01/08/2019 - 0,11 non-reactive.

I forgot to mention that I sucked a lot of the person's nipple (after that blowjob contact aswell, a few days later, but only nipple sucking).

I'm just looking for some clarification here (and maybe some peace of mind). The doctor said that I should take another test February 11th, the date that completes 6 months.

&amp;#x200B;

4 weeks ago I hooked up with a guy on grindr. I usually top, but we decided I would bottom. I put a brand new condom on him which I had just bought the day before. Lots of lube. And sat on it. As it was going in I felt it break. This has never happened to me before. I made him take it out immediatly (and sure enough it was broken).

We were both a bit shocked. He said he was negative (but how can I trust someone I don't know?) and the sex stopped there.

This was a Sunday. The next day, a Monday, I went to the sexual health clinic and asked for PEP - I didn't realise you could get it from an Emergency Room so thought I had to wait till Monday. Silly as time wasted.

Anyway, I began PEP at 32hours post exposure. They also took HIV and STI tests at the appointment which came back negative.

I have just finished the months supply of PEP and am off for a follow up test tomorrow. I'm really scared! 

I hope everything is fine. I havent had sex once during the past month as too traumatised.

&amp;#x200B;

This goes to show, you can be as safe as anything, and cautious and take all the care in the world and these things can STILL happen. It's just bad luck. For starters, I normally top. Secondly, I don't often hook up with randoms. I had bought condoms day before. And I put it on myself because I was paranoid about him not doing it properly... guess you can never be completely safe!

I don't know how it works with health insurance regarding a HIV+ status when entering USA. I am scared of being discriminated by the system or something like that.

Hello guys, this is basically my first post in this channel even though ive been constantly checking it out and have been reading the stories of other gay people around the world.
So let me go straight to the point. I had sex with this guy I met from twitter after we have been texting for a year. So I went to his house, we started by watching a movie and then things escalated and we had sex. but before that, he didn't want to wear a condom until I insisted that he does which would be safer for the both of us.

We went 1 round and then I got tired but he didnt come. I didn't see him remove any condom however but before we were having sex, I saw the condom on his dick. I'm having doubts thinking he removed it durning sex. So I rested for a while when he wanted to fuck me in a missionary position but then I was tired so I told him that i was actually tired so probably some other time. By then, he already had his dick in me but after removing it, i don't really remember seeing any dick.

So, after I came back to my place, I suddenly became paranoid that I may have it since I once had an HIV/AIDS scare back in 2017. I approached him and he said he used a condom. and he didn't cum which was true because I didnt feel any cum in me. I contacted a friend of mine to ask him where I could get Pep drugs but because where I come from is homophobic and the drug is still not yet administered nationwide, its very difficult to come into contact with it unless its a rape case where they think youve come into contact with the virus. I know this sounds pathetic but has there been anyone who has been in my situation like this or is in a situation like this? Thank you."

I’ve been seeing a guy for a little over 3 months now, we’ve been exclusive, things have been pretty great. 

Before we got down to the dirty I asked the all important question, “are you clean and clear?” He told me he was and had recently been tested, hadn’t been with anyone else and had always been safe.  I was the same. 

Fast Forward 3 months and after having intercourse without protection, (stupid, maybe) he told me last night that in fact he has NEVER been tested and can’t be certain he’s clean.  Well. What a predicament that has put me in.  Baring in mind that this is 3 months later after he assured me he was tested and clear.  Now I’ve sat up all night, waiting for the clinic to open so I can call and get an appointment. 
Of course he’s adamant that he doesn’t have anything but how can he know for sure when he’s never been tested? 

I’ve really fallen for this guy and other than this we haven’t really had any issues.  Naturally as stated, I am waiting for the clinic to open so I can call and get an appointment.  But what do I do about our relationship?  Which by the way is also kind of screwed up because he isn’t out and no one knows he’s gay... 

What if.  He has given me something?  What then? 

Any advice on how to proceed would be appreciated.  Please keep the “use protection” advice for a later stage.  I’m well aware.  But given that I believed we were both tested, clean and clear and we were exclusive it seemed okay. "

yesterday i was afflicted with horniness and, unable to arrange a hookup in the traditional sense, I contacted a nearby CD escort who looked attractive.

Shortly after arriving, we were on the bed and doing general foreplay activities.  After briefly giving me a blowjob, she got on top of me and we were just kind of grinding against and feeling each other.. it was quite nice.

However, after a time, I noticed her spitting in her hand and, before I could really understand what was happening, she had pretty much just put my dick in her ass..  At this point I was too horny to protest, and fucked her for 5-10 minutes before cumming in her ass.  no protection.

this was about 12 hours ago.  I have been in a state of constant anxiety ever since.  i do not know her HIV status.  she said afterwards that she was ""totally clean"" and that she gets tested all the time.  She said she's super selective about who she does ""that"" with, and said she did it in my case, only because I looked ""super clean"" myself.

i have looked up so many statistics since this happened.  It would seem that as the top, even if she had HIV and was detectable, my risk for this single incident is below half a percent.  and yet...

i am still terrified.  should i go on PEP???  i would have to pay for the doctor and the prescription out of pocket.  i am just so confused because like... there was no communication!!  she just did it.  and i don't understand why even.  this was not something i requested : (

For context, I will be getting an HIV test next week. 

I'm a gay man who tops. I haven't gotten an HIV test in 7 years. Most if not all the time I use condoms while having sex. There were a couple of partners that I regularly had unprotected sex with but they were HIV negative. There were a probably 2-3 instances where I might've had sex with someone and didn't know their status and it was probably 5 years ago. I know I was reckless and stupid. 

Recently, I was diagnosed with an Anxiety disorder and was perscribed with Lexapro 10mg. Right before I was diagnosed, I was feeling all sorts of physical symptoms and pains and also breathing problems. Recently, I've felt random pain on the right side of my body , particularly on the right side of my chest but it seems like it's going away. Also previously had some pain in the right kidney area that went away. 

My breathing has somewhat gotten better by the day thanks to Lexapro. Recently as of today, I spotted this on my tounge Oral thrush? https://imgur.com/a/mMNJ0WT . Also recently, I did a blood test and found my White Blood Cell count is at 8.9 10E3/mcL and RBC count at 4.85 10E6/mcL and have Vitamin D deficiency at 19ng/mL (for context, I work in an office with no sunlight whatsoever 40hrs a week). 

Are all of these signs of HIV progression or AIDS?"

Apologies if this post is a little all over the place, I rarely post and I havent slept all night sick with anxiety. I know all this requires some Google research and I already have but honestly would just like to hear opinions ect.

For context: So I(24) have been seeing a man (50 and undetectable) for at least 7-8 months, it's literally only a sexual relationship, we meet up and spend the whole weekend together unless we have plans or commitments. Sometimes he will host a party sometimes it's just him and I. He is a dr of sorts and very very well known in the area, so I trust him completely but havent seen or heard from him in 3-4 weeks now.

My friend who knows this man very well; informed me yesterday that he allegedly hasn't been taking his medication, for 4 months, is smoking T every day now (not that that has anything to do with it) and has gone back to his home country. So I'm really worried. For him and for me. 

I know it's all pointless worrying until I have been tested, which I am going to do today but this sort of scare has never happened to me. I've been very f*cking lucky for someone who has been sexually active for as long as I have. I am not on prep because it's not free and I really cant afford it. Or any other medication i should be taking for that fact. 

I don't know what to think to be honest. And I guess my questions would be, what now? What are my chances of being infected (not sure if that's the appropriate word)? How do I move forward? Obviously I've deleted the apps I use but do I notify any one before I get any results?

During the first year we never used protection/condoms when having sex. (I know, dumb from our part, but I was new at everything and was just happy I was finally having sex). 

About a year in my boyfriend started getting really sick to the point he had to get hospitalized. There they found out he was HIV+ and from the state he was in, they assumed he had been infected for quite a long time. Luckily he got help just in time so it didn't evolve into AIDS. I also got tested and fortunately enough, I came out as negative.

Since then we have now always used protection, he has been taking his meds and he is now undetectable.

We both have been reading and listening that being undetectable means he basically can't transmit the virus... so a week ago we decided to start having sex without protection again, since he always felt the condoms were too uncomfortable and he has been undetectable for more than 2 years now.

This morning we had sex without protection again, this time I bottomed and everything was alright... however, after we finished and I went to the bathroom to clean myself, I noticed that I was bleeding. It wasn't much blood, but I'm worried that if with blood involved, if I might be in risk of getting infected.

We're both quite worried, but we try to stay calm with the idea it's not transmittable, even though we're not sure of that applies to when there's some blood involved during sex... also, there's no easy access to PREP or PEP in our country.

Any advise on this it's greatly appreciated."

For what it's worth, I do wear condoms while also on daily Truvada. The only time I drop the condom is if I'm only being with one person and I know he's on Truvada as well and has been tested. For me, the main benefit is the mental health. As someone who has seen therapists for hypochondria, the double protection does a wonder for my state of mind.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, I always see listed in medical handouts, online material, and reddit posts here is that one main reason to continue using condoms is because it doesn't prevent you from other STIs. However, most gay men are still very likely to pick up the other STIs if they include oral sex as part of their sex life. And I feel like oral sex is just as if not more common as anal sex. It doesn't require a partner to feel confident that they can bottom that night. Last year, I had gonorrhea twice while never having sex without a condom. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that condoms are still suggested because there is one reported case of a person getting HIV while on Truvada and in case you forgot to take some of your pills but didn't realize it. These are two good reasons. I wish these were cited more instead of playing off fear of other STIs which are still going to happen unless you cut out oral sex. "

Hey I had a hiv eposure today ( anal sex) and I have a bad feeling I got HIV. If I get a HIV NAT test which is the RNA early detection test and it comes out negative, is it safe to assume that i am HIV Negative or is the test not reliable?

I matched with this guy on bumble a couple days ago, and needless to say, we hit it off pretty quickly.

We have been texting each other constantly over the past couple days, and we even facetimed yesterday for over an hour - even though it didn't feel that wrong. I find myself thinking of him randomly throughout the day, and he admitted he has the same feelings for me. I can honestly say I've never felt like this about someone before, and I honestly don't get what he sees in me.

We live in different states, but he said he's willing to come up so we can ""hang out"" for the weekend - which I wasn't opposed to to all. I was really excited, but today he dropped a bombshell stating he's HIV+ and not undetectable right now. He mentioned he's currently on PrEP, and should be undetectable by next month.

I've honestly never thought I could be with someone who's HIV+, and despite the fact I have been crying over this for quite some time, I still want to make this work out. I know if I also go on PrEP, and we still engage in safe sex practices, the odds of it getting transmitted to me are extremely slim. There's issues with insurance (since mine sucks) but I won't bore you with those details.

Anyway, for those who are negative and with HIV+ partners, how do you make it work out? My family doesn't care that I'm gay, but they wouldn't be supportive of the fact that I'm with someone who's positive - even if I am taking prophylactic medication to decrease my changes of exposure. Sure, I don't have to tell them, but I feel it will come up sooner or later.

Everything is still in the preliminary stages, but I just want tips on how you guys make it work out. I've honestly never felt this way about someone, and the fact his positive status hasn't scared me away is telling - to me, at least."

I was recently diagnosed HIV+, and reading through some old posts on several subreddits, I noticed how much serosegregation, shame and stigma are still very much a thing.

So I just wanted to say : We are human just as much as you. We have feelings, we have hopes and dreams. And we want to be loved and live normal lives.

We may have made a mistake in the past, been raped, got cheated on, caught it during a procedure or on the job, but the fact is that we are now poz. 

So next time that you happen to meet a Poz guy on some dating app, or that this really cute boy you went on several dates with discloses his status, I only ask you to be kind and understanding. Just being able to put yourself out there again takes a huge load of courage and strength for some of us. Read about it, get some info, there are a lot of myths that are in need of debunking. There are a lot of solutions, and happy serodiscordant couples.

I am not asking you to do stuff you are not comfortable with. If HIV is something you cannot handle, you are in every right to move on. What I am asking you to do is to treat that man with respect and kindness. Do not ghost him, do not block him. Be upfront, be empathethic, and say that this cannot work for this or that reason. 

Some of us poz folks do not accept it. Some of us are angry, hopeless, and/or desperate. It is already hard to deal with that chronic illness ( which is no longer a death sentence ), please don't sprinkle salt on an open wound ! 

And PLEASE be safe to the best of your ability. Sometimes the virus will still find it's way despite all your efforts to keep it at bay, but do everything in your power to keep things under control.

Thank you for reading !"

I keep finding mixed answers about if PEP delays seroconversion or not. I took PEP 12-18 hours post exposure and relatively late at night. They told me to take it for 28 days but I guess the pharmacy added more because they gave me a 30 day supply of truvada and 60 day supply of isentress. I finished PEP April 7th and I went in for bloodwork on April 9th, one month post exposure it came back negative. I scheduled another test May 7th which would be 4 weeks post pep and 8 weeks post exposure. Could the May 7th test be considered conclusive or should I move the appointment to 6 weeks post PEP? I tried calling the health department to ask questions but no one is aware of what PEP is and proper testing guidelines or if it delays seroconversion or not.

I do not mean for my anxious self to cause people living with HIV to think I view it as “shameful” in any way. This is about my own obviously messed up interpretation of HIV transmission risk and status stigma. It’s just a disease process that’s my mind has utilized to scare and seemingly control me.

I came out a little early. I was 16. Early 30s now. After the intrusive questions and novelty of my gayness no longer motivated the family’s moralists’, I was still stuck with hearing some version of “just don’t get HIV”. An idiotic and ignorant message, but one delivered during my formative years.

Fast forward to me doing me. Condoms, yes. Obsessive checking of proper wear and application technique. Sometimes doubt left a post-coital me filling a condom with water for “leak checks”, but, hey, I can’t get HIV. 

PreP comes out. Hell yes, I’ll take that. “I still use condoms” was a fun way to break the mood. Side note: bottom here. 

Then I realize I don’t really hook up that much. So I stop the Truvada for a month. Convince my dumbass self it’s not meant for random non sexual exposures. I was basically using it as an anxiety pill. Not for sexual health.

So, a few nights ago, I decided to go out. Realize the “I want dick” feeling is strong. Grab my old bottle. Pop two Truvada pills. No idea if that’s a proper loading dose.

Go out. Meet a guy. He’s cool. Receptive anal sex occurs. Fun was had until my post-cum brain appears. Anxiety flares. Take two more Truvada pills within 10 hours of the initial dose. Grab a travel sized bottle of Crest Mouthwash and teach it to douche away the shame.

Next day, I admit to the guy I made a mistake and am anxious. He asks what he can do. He ends up getting an Oraquick. Results show negative for antibody detection. My brain thinks of the window period. I call some doctor friends. Prescriptions result. Now I’m on post exposure prophylaxis. Isentress plus Truvada.  

I don’t think it’s a remotely healthy, evidence-based, or an appropriate response, but I’m doing it.

I think HIV stigma has pushed me to consider myself less sexual than I want to be. I think I’m overly critical of my sexual mistake. 

Anybody else react or think in this manner? Or feel this way? It’s like logic, liver/kidney health, enjoyment of sexual connection are thrown to the side for a seemingly bullshit fear. 

Way too long a post.

TLDR: Medium-sized Crest mouthwash bottles aren’t too bad at douching."

I'm on PrEP (1 month now) and in a fit of horniness/confidence/newly-on-PrEP, I went out and bareback topped a guy who I found out after is HIV+. His profile listed it; I just didn't look (see: horniness/confidence/recklessness). He's undetectable and on his med regiment. He's also a pretty darn trustworthy guy I know from various classes we've taken together. 

When I read his profile after, my gut sank. I have always been incredibly paranoid about HIV (to the point where I sprinted out of 4th period English in 10th grade to get tested after having only had oral sex but worrying about a sore throat). I've been on edge since the hookup. I even took myself to the university doctor, explained the situation, and was basically sat down in a room and given the U=U talk. They also rebuffed my questions about PEP, given that (1) I'm on PrEP and take it consistently, (2) he's undetectable and follows his regiment, and (3) I topped. 

I've essentially resigned myself to celibacy until I get tested outside of the window period, but I know that's ridiculous. I figure now is a good time to reach out and ask for advice both on this specific situation (do I remain celibate? Do I tell a future hookup?) and to seek some advice on how to dispel my notions about HIV+. I rationally know sleeping with him was safer than sleeping with someone who doesn't know their status. But that rational thinking isn't winning the day right now; my anxiety and the stigma are winning. 

Would love some advice because I'd really rather not remain celibate for the next 2-3 months!"

HIV isn’t the end of the world.  Acknowledging that most people with HIV take only one pill a day for the condition, are reasonably healthy and will live an almost normal lifespan isn’t “normalizing HIV”.  It’s acknowledging that life with HIV is normal.  There have been attempts to misrepresent this, apparently out of some fear that if young folks aren’t sufficiently terrified they’ll run out and get their bussies pozzed.  They won’t.

Have any of you actually seen someone who was newly diagnosed?  No one tests positive because of a lack of fear.  They test positive because they don’t know they’re at risk, because things happen outside their control and because they make normal human mistakes.  It is incredibly shitty and counterproductive to perpetuate a narrative of doom.  You lose credibility in light of those of us who thrive.  Worse, you create the HIV misery you purport to prevent."

My counterstory:

When I was 22, I met this guy from Tinder. We hung out for a while and then got back to my place to have sex. I had already asked him on Tinder whether he was clean from STDs, he said yes, so we had sex. Protected sex. We were together for 7 months. I hadn’t gotten tested since I met him and we were having protected sex all the time. One day, I went to the dentist and when I finished, I decided to go to the healthcare center to take an STDs test since it was in the same building.

A few days later, the doctor called telling me that I tested positive for HIV. It was lunch break at work and I started crying in front of all my coworkers. I went back home and yelled at the lying piece of shit I dated and he cried saying that he didn’t want to let me know about his real HIV status so that “I don’t leave him”. I was outraged. I could’ve sued him for what he did where I live, but it wasn’t worth it. Now I’m only 24 with HIV, which has made finding dates extremely difficult, but does that justify lying to the people I see? Hell no! Does it (at least) justify not disclosing my HIV status until we meet? NO!

That guy’s story and his HIV+ bf could lead guys with HIV to avoid disclosing their status until they meet their dates in person or even worse, lie about their status. You must understand that anyone who’s HIV+ should never hide or lie about his status with anyone they plan to date/hook up with."

Let’s face the facts. No cure exist for HIV. 
If not treated, (which cost a shit load of fucking money/thousands and thousands of dollars) for the rest of your life. The carrier will die. 

Yes I said it. The person left untreated will die. Yep. I said it. Sorry for the positive people in the room. If left untreated. 

Now!!! The good news. And these are choices you will have to make if you choose to date someone who was positive that is seeking or has found treatment. They can go into undetectable mode. What this means is with proper treatment (for the rest of their life) and it cost a shit load of fucking money.... (not lying) —— assisted programs exist.... /not lying. /very expensive..... has some downsides. /not getting into these right now.... 

Anyways. They can have sex with another man.... and the ability for it to cross is extremely extremely low. 

However!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  That combination along with PREP and along with CONDOMS will make the number even lower. 

So here’s the issue.... that bath house, or that party you go too, or that mixed drink that puts you over the edge and that person chooses that’s undetectable to not tell you..... the numbers are low.... but maybe consider something like PREP.... 

But prep we don’t know the long term on that shit either? Honestly.... just be very safe. Make smart choices. Be with people that are FUCKING honest. I can’t tell you want to do, or what choices to make. 

But I know this..... reality check ok? 
If HIV is left untreated... which is extremely life altering expensive... think fucking Cadillac payments for the rest of your life expensive..... if left untreated. 

That person will die. Or spread HIV/AIDS to others.

Frankly, you'll be in a better position to have control over your sexual health if you accept that you are not owed a disclosure. You can't control what other people choose to tell you - and plenty of people who are HIV+ don't know they are infected . But you can control your own decisions about your sexual health. You should assume that any potential partner can be HIV positive without knowing it (the situation in which the infection most often spreads) - or hasn't reached the point where they trust you enough to tell you - and act accordingly. If you choose to introduce more risks in your sexual practices, own your decisions.

But I have an actual question and not my opinion so here we go gay bros.

Backstory: I am +UD and not afraid of admitting it. I take care of myself and prefer to be honest about it simply because being afraid of being turned down because of it is exhausting.

Finally met a guy yesterday that I'd been chatting with for a week or so. No sexual conversations, just learning about one another. I won't get into the specific details about the guy, just know he's a bit younger, incredibly cute, and it seems we have a solid amount of similar interests. So, we agreed to meet and get lunch just to get a feel for the vibe. Things go well, really well honestly, and I invite him to hang out at my apartment.  After a while of teaching him how to play Smash Ultimate, we unwind and I note that I'd like to kiss him but don't want to overstep his boundaries and make him uncomfortable. Lucky for me, he wants to also. We kiss for a bit but are now aware I need to get up (got distracted with enjoying learning about him that I didn't realize I was an hour late for work lol).

Here's where the boat starts to rock. As we cool off and go back to just talking while I get ready, he asks the golden question of STDs, to which I answer honestly and give a short bit of my story with it. Somewhere in here, he discloses to me that he is a ***virgin***. He's a little unnerved but he also notes that he's not well-educated at all on the subject of HIV. He says that I seem like a great guy and he enjoys how interactions. Unsurprisingly, he has a fair bit to think about, but it really does seem like his interest is still there. However, my need for advice is actually on my side of this.

I try to be very considerate of my partner, but this is new territory for me. Is it weird that I'm now uncertain about what I want with him simply because I don't know if I want put a great guy who hasn't really explored his sexuality yet at risk? I know the spiels of diminishing risk-behaviors and whatnot, but my anxiety won't let me get past the fact that this would be me, carrying something that *can* be heavy with me for possibly the rest of my life, wanting to be involved with someone who doesn't have much sexual experience at all. I don't think I should be as concerned with it as I am, but I couldn't stop thinking about the circumstances while at work.

Any advice or kind opinions are greatly appreciated. I just need a different perspective on the matter."

( could totally be lying, but then again if he didn't care why wouldn't he just ejaculate in my butt instead of asking me where to shoot his load?...) 

I kind of forgot about it. But now I'm so stressed again and can't get tested untill after my exams (after the 22nd of june, I'll go to a planned parenthood type of thing). The paranoia is killing me. I try to tell myself whatever's done is done. 

My Muslim and Arab background makes it even worse. Nobody can know. I can't even begin to imagine how I'd deal with being HIV positive with my cultural background. 


Please I know I should always protect myself. Didn't happen since. I was planning on killing myself the night of and miraculously failed.

Since there has been so many posts lately about HIV and testing positive or negative, just remember that even if someone got a negative result, they may still be positive.

When they check for HIV, they measure the amount of antibodies present. It can take up to 6 months for your body to produce enough antibodies to show a positive result. 

So that guy who said he just got test in April and showed negative, he could actually be infected and at his highest rate of transmission and not show positive until as late as October.

Take that information as you will. Just because someone is ""negative"" doesnt mean you should risk it. Just remember no matter what to always be safe. Its not worth the risk."

Some posts treat HIV+ people like the bogeyman, other posts act like HIV+ people are life's way of scaring ""regular"" gays ""straight.""

For all the advice, good, bad and wrong in the last few days, here's my advice on dealing with HIV from someone who's been positive and (now) happy for over a decade.

Think long and hard who you will tell. You don't owe the world, or anyone, an explanation, and you can't untell. You don't need to be an advocate to have value 

Don't be afraid to change a doctor. There's some nice ones and not nice ones out in the world, don't suffer for no reason

Don't neglect your ""other"" health; from weight to smoking to that ingrowing toenail you never dealt with. You're entire health doesn't need to revolve around HIV

Connect with other positive people in the community and listen to them. There's an enormous gulf between what a doctor tells you and the actual lived experiences of human beings

Re-infection isn't real. Not when you're on treatment, anyway. Don't be afraid of sex. If it's nerve wracking at first, go slow or find other HIV positive people to re-learn the ropes with. But you are entitled to an amazing sex life and there's no reason you can't have it

Treatment is more than a pill, it's acupuncture, mental health therapy, exercise, massage, self-care, etc etc. Don't neglect it

You deserve happiness, so cutting out negative people, jobs, family members, or removing yourself from bad situations is always going to be the answer, trust yourself

Sometimes love isn't worth it, and sometimes they aren't worth your love

If you're being the best version of yourself, or working towards it, you're doing things right

If you can, keep a little reserve of pills around. An extra months supply is a nice buffer to have (oh pharmacist I'm going away, next month, can you give me early?)

Imagine how you want your life to look in 1 or 5 or 10 years time, then work backwards from there

You are strong. Stronger than 99% of other people you will meet. Be strong and be fierce in your own way

You'll have sex. And better sex, than you EVER did when you were negative

And the best thing? You'll never have the anxiety of taking another HIV test again!

Happy living, my fellow HIV+ gaybros!"

For guys with HIV:

Do they all become undetectable once they get on medication?

How early do they have to get on medication to be considered undetectable? For example, if a guy just knew that he contacted HIV when he has had it for 8-12 months, can he still get on medication and be undetectable?

I read that if a guy is HIV undetectable, he can never transmit the virus, is that true? Not even by a 1% chance?

As for guys with Herpes:

If they are on medication, can they still transmit it and by how much chance?"

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;An end to the Aids epidemic could be in sight after a landmark study found men whose HIV infection was fully suppressed by antiretroviral drugs had no chance of infecting their partner.  
The success of the medicine means that if everyone with HIV were fully treated, there would be no further infections.  
Among nearly 1,000 male couples across Europe where one partner with HIV was receiving treatment to suppress the virus, there were no cases of transmission of the infection to the HIV-negative partner during sex without a condom. Although 15 men were infected with HIV during the eight-year study, DNA testing proved that was through sex with someone other than their partner who was not on treatment.  
“It’s brilliant – fantastic. This very much puts this issue to bed,” said Prof Alison Rodgers from University College London, the co-leader of the paper [published in the Lancet](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)30418-0/fulltext) medical journal. Earlier studies have also shown the treatment protects heterosexual couples where one partner has HIV.  
She added: “Our findings provide conclusive evidence for gay men that the risk of HIV transmission with suppressive ART \[antiretroviral therapy\] is zero. Our findings support the message of the [international U=U campaign](http://i-base.info/u-equals-u/) that an undetectable viral load makes HIV untransmittable.

&amp;#x200B;

Probably a timely reminder that there is still an incredible amount of stigma around people living with HIV. In light of the recent threads surrounding this issue in [r/askgaybros](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros) like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/bjhkky/guys_who_are_hiv_should_always_disclose_their/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/bisofx/i_went_on_a_date_with_a_guy_who_told_me_he_was/), in which I read a lot of people's comments stating that they would ***never*** date someone with HIV, I'm happy to see this article released today which is further reinforcing what science has been telling us for years: that people with an undetectable viral load are ***unable to transmit the virus***. 0% likelihood. So yes, it is important to disclose your status, and it is important to take this very seriously. But if you meet a guy who was diagnosed years ago, is being treated with antiretrovirals and has consistently been undetectable, your refusal to date that man is in my opinion, irrational, and only adding to the stigma that they live with every day of their lives.

I personally went through this experience where the guy I met up with from Grindr told me on date #2 about his status. I was already on PrEP, we used condoms too for a while (hello all other STIs). After a couple of weeks, we became exclusive and my doctor advised me that continuing to take PrEP was unnecessary, as the absolute strongest method of HIV prevention is being undetectable. And, guess what - here I am three years later, happily committed and living with an HIV+, undetectable man, enjoying amazing unprotected sex every day, and we're both happy &amp; healthy. And I'm literally safer than if I was sleeping around!

Happy Thursday/Friday everyone, wherever you are!"

&amp;#x200B;

From the article:

&gt;Among nearly 1,000 male couples across Europe where one partner with HIV  was receiving treatment to suppress the virus, there were **no cases** of transmission of the infection to the HIV-negative partner during sex without a condom.  
&gt;  
&gt;Although 15 men were infected with HIV during the eight-year study, **DNA  testing proved that was through sex with someone other than their**  **partner who was not on treatment**. 

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing your status and taking treatment is crucial. HIV is a manageable disease, and with proper measures it becomes akin to live with hemophilia, vitamin deficiency or asthma. 

&gt;Alex immediately began antiretroviral treatment, initially taking four pills a day, which was reduced to one pill once his viral load came down to undetectable levels several months later 

&amp;#x200B;

This can end the HIV/AIDS epidemic:

&gt; “The results provide yet one more catalyst for a universal test-and-treat strategy to provide the full benefits of antiretroviral  drugs. **This and other strategies continue to push us toward the end of  Aids**.” 

&amp;#x200B;

Use condoms. Get tested. Fight ignorance."

I will ignore the bad voices on here but hope to find some nice ones.

I am confused and need I formation... I will visit a doctor in few weeks I guess to get more info but right now am fresh out of the hospital.

I found the best man of my life... And after many years of struggle we finally are going to get married.

Today he wrote me an email...
We are in the moment living apart due to visa complications.

He said he got HIV. Is meds and undetectable.

So many thoughts boomed into my brain...

I start crying and am still crying because am worried about his health and don't wanna loose him early in life.

I know if u living healthy taking meds and r undetectable... Blabla right now am shocked... Can someone tell me clearly... Will hiv decrease... Or will I loose him early in my life?

He said he was trying to tell me many many times but always scared to tell me... So he did now. I dunno why I can't stop crying. Sorry guys for this shit...

Our relationship is complicated anyway...
I never expected this... He comes from. Africa and had tubercolosis and then while doing tests his test came back positiv then negativ and in 2016 positive.

We hadn't had anal sex yet... I swallowed 2 times his load... 
Do I need to be worried when he's undetectable?
I read it... Nooo but can someone pls say it loud...

Am just shocked... Swallow incident was 8th March on 25th I had the blood tests in hospital and 30th Mai was the operation. Though they didn't took any blood... They wouldn't not check my blood values while doing an operation or? I dunno... Was several days in hospital.

3 months after that beginning June will get tested again and then get on prep.

Am just shocked... And repeating myself... I still don't believe he would harm me and that he's telling me the truth about being undetectable.
Am of course now worried... Super worried... Less about my hiv status... I can't change it now anyway I read that the chances of getting it via swallowing is minimal and if he's undetectable it's basically not possible... True?

Am just... Am scared of loosing him early in my life... Am still madly in love with him he's still my dream man... Why my tears not stopping...?"

I dunno... I just need to get it off my chest.

My man told me he is hiv positive. I knew some stuff... But still kinda flipped out however never considered leaving him... Or maybe shocked is a better word.

So basically ... Besides the stigma in society... And testing and meds for him... His life will be as normal as mine as hiv negative... (I know nothing of that is easy but I just try to phrase it) 

So... 

If he's undetectable
If he's taking his meds
If he's regularly at a doctor and gets his testings
If he's being healthy in other aspects too like eating, gym, no smoking drugs or so...
If we presume he's not cheating on me (yadda yadda stds yadda) 

His life with me will be just fucking normal... 

So why are my thoughts in the moment running wild on possibilities... Finding information... And it kinda feels just strange like a bubble plopped... Like am still kinda anxious... 

My brain says one thing but in my guts Is still tornado going on... 

Maybe I just need to process it...

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's one of the dreadful Qs you see coming up quite often, but I would like an opinion on this if possible.

So 2 weeks ago I had protected sex with a guy from grindr (i'm bottom), he came inside the condom, although he didn't take it out immediately. I am sure that there was cum in the condom but not sure whether it leaked out. Then i gave a handjob to him and I had a plaster over the cut on my hand, it had already formed a scab but it may have came into contact with the cum. Then a week later i came down with a sore throat, cough and runny nose for a week which just got better, this got me worried.

I am currently going through some very important exams in my life, by the time it gets to 4 weeks after it happened I would be halfway through my exams, so I'm not sure whether getting tested in the middle of my exam period would be a good idea in case something happens, what do you think?

I topped him and the condom broke and we didn’t know it for at least a minute. I came inside him. Afterwards I saw that the condom had broken and he just shrugged. I told him that I am on Prep (I have taken it every day since August) and was just tested. That’s when he decided to tell me he was undetectable...

I got mad at him and he said he’d told me earlier but he certainly hadn’t. He didn’t see what the big deal was because he said undetectable people can’t transmit, which the CDC did say is true. I didn’t freak out too much because I’m on prep, I was the insertive partner, and he said he’s undetectable (there’s the whole U=U thing but who knows if he’s being truthful). With those factors in place it’s really hard to transmit but I told my doctor about it anyway. She said my factors do lower the risk but there’s still a risk and wants me to get a round of tests this week. 

I know there’s not a lot I can do at this point, and my chances of contracting it are very low to begin with (less than 1%) but the precautions my doctor want me to undertake just got me a little spooked.

Am I missing anything else? Pep isn’t an option since I’m on prep already, there wasn’t any cuts or anything on me, the exposure time wasn’t long, and it was a one-time thing with him (I dumped the guy, can’t trust him)."
bm4ug6,First anonymous/brief anal experience. Anxious about HIV,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/bm4ug6/first_anonymousbrief_anal_experience_anxious/,AnxiousG,0,5/8/2019 5:46,6,/r/askgaybros/comments/bm4ug6/first_anonymousbrief_anal_experience_anxious/,Advice,"NSFW

Hey guys. As the title says I had my first anonymous + short-lived anal experience less than 24 hours ago. Just some stuff about me, I identify as bi to my few close friends because I’ve had a few experiences with other guys, although looking back I didn’t enjoy the sex so much as I did the company. I was also never worried about diseases because I had never been with an out sexually-active person (my guys were mostly closeted non-sexually active churchy guys or a bisexual guy in a committed relationship) and I had never had anal sex or any kind of sexual contact with someone I did not know, boys or girls. I’m also fairly stupid with HIV information so I hope you can be patient with me.

So this was just a few hours ago. I don’t really know what came over drunk me but I downloaded Grindr and created an empty account and sent to ANYONE who’d want to “top” me. I quickly found someone willing, probably because I am in a large city and I didn’t have a lot of criteria. He actually seemed like a nice guy, we meet and he brings lube and condoms. Everything seemed as I expected.  We start foreplay and he proceeded to push his dick in my throat as far back as he could (with my consent, probably my idea) and he did this for a while but I gagged so much that I had to stop. Next was the main event. He put on a condom and some lube and at first he was struggling to put it inside because he said I was really tight, but when he did I felt the worst pain I have ever felt down there. Ever in my life. Like I was completely stunned. 

It must have been just one or two pumps in when I told (pleaded with) him to stop and that we should do something else. I take off his condom and go on top of him and we proceeded to do some oral work, and he rubs his dick in my butthole (no penetration but it was in the center area) without a condom. I realize that my anus was a little sticking out probably from his putting his dick in there. It felt sort of ok and I didn’t feel any sting as far as I know. I was curious and started massaging his crack but he said no. Drunk me may or may not have licked the anal juice (seriously super drunk). I ask him if he was negative and he said yes. but are people really honest about this? We finish, I leave. I thought I was mostly bored and did some acting to make him feel good, and that’s when it sort of clicked that I was probably never into it. I then proceed to delete Grindr forever.

I woke up after taking a nap for a shower and I see that my underwear is partially soaked in blood. I was still a little drunk so I didn’t worry so much about anything but the image did stick with me. 

First of all, how much risk for HIV did I put myself into by:

1) Deepthroating 
2) Rubbing penis full of pre-cum in my portruding bleeding butthole

I assume I was at risk for other STIs and I will get checked, but I’m a little worried about HIV because I did some research on some clinics here and I gather that:

a) Where I live PEP is very expensive and not covered by insurance. 
b) Asking a medical professional if I qualify for PEP also costs quite a bit of money. 
c) Also I don’t have much time to get PEP so I would  need to take a leave off work to even get a consultation
d) HIV medication is incredibly expensive as well

I appreciate you reading this and sorry if I seem really dumb or inexperienced"

Association between rectal douching and HIV and other sexually transmitted infections among men who have sex with men: a systematic review and meta-analysis

Abstract

Background: Men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV and other STIs worldwide. Rectal douching, which is commonly used by MSM in preparation for anal sex, may increase the risk of HIV and other STIs by injuring the rectal mucosa. Results from individual studies reporting associations between rectal douching and HIV and other STIs among MSM are inconsistent. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the association between rectal douching and HIV and other STIs among MSM.

Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science for studies published from January 1970 to November 2018. Studies that reported ORs and 95% CIs of associations between rectal douching and infection with HIV/STIs, or reported enough data to calculate these estimates, were included. We assessed risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. ORs were pooled using a random effects model.

Results: Twenty-eight eligible studies were identified in our review, of which 24 (20 398 participants) were included in the meta-analysis. Rectal douching was associated with increased odds of infection with HIV (OR 2.80, 95% CI 2.32 to 3.39), and any STI other than HIV (including hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and human papillomavirus) (OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.95 to 3.11) among MSM. For specific STIs, douching was associated with increased odds of viral hepatitis (HBV, HCV) (OR 3.29, 95% CI 2.79 to 3.87), and chlamydia or gonorrhoea (OR 3.25, 95% CI 2.02 to 5.23). These associations remained significant in studies that adjusted for potential confounders.

Conclusion: Rectal douching may put MSM at increased risk for infection with HIV and other STIs. Longitudinal studies are needed to clarify this association, and health education materials should inform men of the potential for increased risk of infection with rectal douching.

He's a dom and we were planning on having a BDSM session tomorrow morning. He has been very clear about prioritizing my safety and comfort and everything, and I trust that he is honest/has my best interest in mind.

That being said, I was surprised when I saw that he is HIV positive (note - it does not say undetectable, it just says positive, so I assume it is detectable) and as somebody who is not on PReP, I am a little nervous. 

It would be very very disappointing for both of us if I had to cancel because we've been talking for an extremely long time, but if my safety is at risk I absolutely will. But I want to avoid that if I'm not in immediate risk. 

So am I? If we avoid penetrative sex (which he's okay with) is that enough of a precaution? Can I even suck his dick, or does that put me in danger? I was talking to a nurse at an STD clinic a while ago who told me infections can be spread even through pre-cum, is this true of HIV? Because it's strictly BDSM, I'm confident we can still meet and have a lot to do even without anal or oral, but a) is it necessary that I avoid both of those and b) will avoiding them be enough? Or should I cancel until I get on PReP?

I plan on messaging him and talking about it before we meet regardless but I would like my questions answered first. I mean I don't even really know how to approach him about this.

Any advice is appreciated, thank you."

I was on top, used a condom, gave and received oral (no condom). Condom never broke and the guy -- according to him at least -- was on PreP and negative. I'm a bit of a hypochondriac and don't normally hook up like this so I was pretty worried about somehow catching HIV. Had no symptoms until last week and more or less forgot about the whole thing. 

Last Wednesday, I ate some Chinese food and got pretty sick. Indigestion, chills, fever, gas, exhaustion. I got a little bit sketched out because I've never really seen this before. I've gotten food poisoning in the past but those times I was vomiting, which didn't happen here. Just a ton of abdominal discomfort and a fever which has never happened in my life. Even weirder, I went outside in the cold on Saturday and the fever got way worse -- went from relatively mild to a 101. I'm much better today though. 

I went to the doctor today and she told me that I have a ton of stool still in my stomach that hasn't been evacuated yet. She said that this was causing the stomach woes but didn't really know what was causing the fever. She said it's a possibility that the fever is meant to kill of stomach bacteria/infections but wasn't 100%. 

I don't like getting a shaky medical analysis like this. I plan on getting an HIV rapid test on Friday anyway, but until then, I wanted to know if anyone has seen anything like this, can classify it, and can tell me whether it's a possible symptom of HIV. 

From what I gather HIV symptoms mostly show up between 2-4 weeks after exposure and usually are pretty intense -- 104+ fever, full body rashes, etc etc. This is unpleasant but nowhere close to that."

I used a condom and for the last minute of sex, the condom broke.

He also tells me he goes to the doctors every month for his blood pressure medication which I'm guessing he insinuated that he gets tested regularly. 

Over the weekend I started to feel the following symptoms:

-tight breathing

 • some red spots near my groin (that went away after 2 days, appeared right after I went swimming.)

-fever like symptoms after swimming (although my body temperature was at 97.1), feeling chills and some sweats. My upper torso felt like a tingling sensation through it, as if it was receiving something. 

-headache for 1/2 of the day. 

-nausua, barely eating anything Saturday evening and mid Sunday, no need to vomit though. 

-It was hard to tell but I might've had a swollen lymph node on my thigh near my groin. It was really small and didn't hurt at all.

-achey legs and feet (maybe from working out?) 

All of these symptoms lasted for only 1.5 days. 

I did have watery diarrhea for two weeks but that might've been because of the antibiotic I was taking due to the root canal treatment I did a few weeks ago. 

The diarrhea did however stop when these symptoms showed up. 

Don't worry, I'm going to get tested. I just want to know if this is all in my head or not."

I was such in a bad place about myself so I let myself lose in the hookup culture.

However, of all those hookups, I never, NEVER had anal/penetrative sex because somehow, my fear of getting HIV outweighed my curiosity. So when people ask me if I’m top or bottom, I always say I’m side.

Basically, all my sexual encounters have only been oral sex, most of which I receive the act. And on the occasional times I give oral sex, I never, NEVER let them ejaculate in my mouth. My big mistake however was that sometimes I would brush my teeth before meeting up with a hookup because I want to spook my sexual partner with bad breath. However, I don’t think I’ve ever given oral with outright bleeding elements in my mouth. I know pre-cum is another story but yeah.

Even when I was with a committed partner, who was also a side, we never did penetration or ejaculation in the mouth. Boring, I know, but it was just the way it is.

Anyway, I’m just paranoid that all my hookups are starting to catch up with me. For the past six months, I’ve had three bouts of diarrhea (which lasted a day or two) and a few instances of “flu” (mild cough, fever, sore throat, etc) that mostly lasted 2 – 3 days at most. I also had two instances of a boil, possibly by folliculitis, on my pubic area in the past six months (logical reason would be tight running gear which I use repeatedly, but yeah I don’t know).  Just this morning, I saw this purplish lesion on my arm which looked like a pimple and bled when I scratched it accidentally.

I always ask my sexual partners about their status, to which they would say they’re negative. Of course, the paranoid guy in me that all my hookups are HIV+ that’s why I never engage in risky behaviors. 

I live in a country with a low-prevalence in HIV, but has a rising rate in infections. The greater area of the city I’m in has around 12 million people. Unfortunately, I don’t have specific numbers regarding the number of cases in this area (probably thousands). 

I have suffered from health anxiety in the past. I know oral sex is considered very low risk (possibly even zero in practical cases) but my health anxiety is ruining me, making me think that I’m being punished for getting all those oral acts from guys, and occasionally, giving it back to them."

There were some lesions in my genital area which she said it was normal because the rash and blistering are generalized.

I bottomed for a guy bareback on May 13th and he came in me. My symptoms have included chills, muscle/bones aches, loss of appetite, night sweats, mild sore throat and a little bit of diarrhea/gas.

The silver lining is that I am also on PrEP: but I know that it's not 100% effective necessarily.

What really tripped me out was I looked on this guys Grindr profile and there was no HIV status in his bio. I text text him and ask and he said he was negative the last time he was tested, but I have no idea how long ago that was. (Or if he's not flat out lying)

The thing that really worries me is that I know being on PrEP if you have the virus can make the medications not work to treat HIV. So I'm really worried if I should stop taking it until I get more details. I tested negative to a 4th generation antibody test on May the 24th to renew my PrEP prescription, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything only 11 days after the potential exposure.

I'm wanting to wait a few more weeks to get tested again to make sure the result is actually accurate, but am I just crazy paranoid or am I right to be legitimately concerned.

I honestly think the stress, anxiety, and worry will cause more harm to you than HIV could.  I'm starting PrEP now. No more HIV scares for me. 

To those who are positive you guys are strong. I researched everything from trying to live and work abroad to prep to ADA, joining the military, medical costs, and of course the social stigmas, and while HIV is not a death sentence anymore, there are still some shitty barriers and ignorance that I personally in my ""preparation"" was not ready to deal with.

First off I know these kinds of questions have been asked before and I know I need to get tested to confirm. I have an appointment Wednesday but I’m terrified I’m going to test positive.

What is the risk that I could have gotten HIV from giving oral to multiple guys with just precum?  I never took a load in my mouth and I was usually the one getting sucked when I hooked up, but I would guess I gave blowjobs to at least 10 guys with some precum involved in the last 5 years. I don’t think I had bleeding cuts in my mouth, and I always avoided brushing and flossing before encounters, but in the last year or so I’ve had a sore throat and several times have had numerous sores in my mouth, and I keep thinking they could have been present when I performed oral before.

I have been getting sick every couple months for the last year or so and can’t find any reason for it. More recently, I’ve been having other random health issues come and go.  I tested last in 2017, and based on my conversation with the healthcare provider last time, took all the needed precautions when performing oral and never did anal, and didn’t think I’d need to test again.  Once I started getting sick I started researching again and have found various websites and forums that suggested otherwise, and I’ve had pretty bad anxiety/panic disorder in the past, so I can’t really even tell if I’m overreacting or not.

The CDC website which I want to trust seems to say that there’s only a risk in oral when there’s ejaculation involved, but it isn’t really that specific. I don’t really expect anybody on reddit to have better info than the CDC, but I’m so scared of my test Wednesday and I don’t know what I’m going to do if I test positive, I’m just freaking out.

how can i have sex without being afraid of spreading this disease to other?

Is that okay for me as hiv+ having sex with someone who also have the same status with me with no protection? Cause for me as mostly bottom dont like condom inside my ass

Today he told me that he had HIV, he said he got it after he was raped at a party but was being treated and his status is undetectable.

My ex and i got back together almost 8 months ago, the first thing that he told me when we got together was that he got HIV and that he was not in threatment because he was scared of going to the hospital and all that process, since he found out and until he began taking his pills more than a year passed, nowadays he has gone through 3 months of his treatment (altough he has not got tested to see if the amount of virus in his blood decreased) after 5 months of delaying the process of starting it. We decided not to have sex until he completed that and was safe for both of us. In the middle of that i found out that also he got HPV and he had to go through surgery to fix that, its been a couple of days since his surgery. 

Through all of this i've been supportive, beeing there for him and we had very serious and profound talks about both of us and this situation, we do not take it lightly, at the same time I have gone through huge changes in my life in the last months like getting the much needed mental health that i was delaying in getting and lost a ton of weight boosting my confidence and self steem.

But i can't help to notice that there is no intimacy or contact, only 2 o 3 times in 8 months, i get it if he does not feel safe to have sexual contact (even though we talked about safe sexual practices like oral sex with a condom, masturbation, etc) but even when i try to make out passionaly or something like that all i get are ""sweet kisses"" very innocent, and it's not recent its been like that since we started this, and i cant help to compare how passionate we where when we where together 5 years ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't help to feel like a piece of shit about thinking of leaving him, but i tried lots of approachs to connect physically and i notice that the lack of that is affecting the way i feel about him and our dynamics. I love the boy and he has told me that i'm the only one that he can talk to about all of this but at the same time i'm feeling like i'm quiting a lot of things about myself for him, and for him to be safe and to boost his confidence and self steem.

I don't know if i'm the right person to help him with this, and it makes me really sad because everyday that passes i feel like we are growing further apart, i want to fix this, i want to be with him but not at the expense of losing myself and i feel like i am. And i dont want to bring this up to him because i feel like this is nothing compared with what he is going through but that does not mean that i dont feel it.

First of all I'm really sorry if this questions gets asked too often and you are bothered by it. It's just that I couldnt find any answer by doing research online.

So, 3 weeks ago I gave a blowjob. My tooth was broken and it was kind of sharp. That made my tongue have a sore (that didn't bleed) but it also made my partner bleed a bit from his penis. He didn't cum in my mouth. But when we were done I spitted some blood in the sink (it was really not a lot).

So I know in general oral sex is not very dangerous, and I also know that having mouth sores increase the risk of infection. Im just wondering, is it very risky what happened to me? How likely I am to have HIV?

Because if it's indeed the case it sets a dangerous precedent. HIV might be manageable nowadays but it's still not something you'd like to catch. I get they're trying to fight the stigma but this isn't the right way, as it will freak HIV- people even more.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead, focus on studying if U=U applies to (within reason) blood exposure and if the results show that there is no risk then outlaw work- and sports-related HIV tests.

Not actually gay but I saw some posts resembling mine here and thought this would be a good place to ""ask gay bros"".

I had unprotected sex with a girl who had an IUD and who had been tested. I then had unprotected sex with her again last Friday (6/14) and ripped my frenulum during sex, but didn't realize and finished, so open wound. This is when I started freaking out about HIV.

She says I am the only person she's had sex with since end of March. Also, due to her work, she says she's been tested (4th gen) for HIV as recently as the week before we had sex last. She's the only person I've had sex with in the last 2 years.

The issue is how I've felt since we've had sex. I've been so fucking stressed about this and it's too early for a test. I've been having very mild fever symptoms and can't stop thinking about what if I have HIV. Every time I think about it I get sick to my stomach. My stomach's been hurting for the past couple days and I haven't been eating any different than usual, and I'm pooping multiple times a day and it's not diarrhea but it's coming out very smooth. I have no appetite and am forcing myself to eat. My head hurts slightly. Also I noticed some ""freckles"" on my back and I can't remember if I've always had them or if they're new. Does this look like the early stages of the HIV rash to anyone? They are flat, but I'm checking 2x a day and it always seems to be getting worse and I can't tell if I'm paranoid. Every time I feel an itch on my back I feel like it's a rash finally breaking the surface and it ends up just looking the same but I feel like it's worse.

[https://imgur.com/a/KrUjEzG](https://imgur.com/a/KrUjEzG)

I've communicated my fears to her and she says ""I can swear that I don't have HIV as many times as I want. I'm sorry you feel sick, you probably just have a cold, but if you're really concerned you need to go get tested. You probably are just getting sick. Like everyone does many times a year without it being related to HIV.""

She's right I need to get tested but I'm going on a family trip for the next week and a half so I can't get tested until after that. I just want some fucking peace of mind. I feel like I've ruined my life...just what if?

Thank you."

I asked him if he was negative beforehand and he told me yes. He’s texted me less today but I asked him again he said ‘yes I’m neg, why would I put you at risk for anything?’ Which is still kind of putting me at risk but whatever. 

When we were fooling around I tried to spread him apart and rim him but he said no so I didn’t get a look at his ass. However I felt it and I didn’t feel anything.... off, I guess.

I'll just start out saying that I'm on PReP. I'm a pretty severe hypochondriac, and I can't help but feel like I'm gonna be the statistic that caught HIV while on PReP. I had condomless sex (I was the insertive partner) with a complete stranger about a month ago. He said he was HIV negative (and not on PReP), but who really knows. Two weeks later I started to develop flu-like symptoms, such as a fever, loss of appetite, achy muscles and joints, loose stool, and a sore throat. That lasted for about 4 days, the symptoms subsided, but then came back again about a week later. I was super concerned I was seroconverting because none of my friends were sick and I had to my knowledge not been in contact with sick people (people have started getting sick with strep within the past week though, which has made me feel better, in a strange way).

 I went to the doctor for my sore throat, she said that I had strep and sent me off with some antibiotics. I told the doctor my concerns about contracting HIV on PReP, and she just laughed at me. After the appointment I could not shake the idea that I contracted HIV. I noticed a little wart on my penis the following day, and went to Planned Parenthood, where they removed it and told me I had HPV. I mentioned to the nurse there that I was concerned about seroconversion and contracting HIV, and she said that it was a definite possibility and recommended that I get an HIV rapid test. I did the test and it came back negative, but I have also heard that HIV rapid tests are only conclusive at the 3-month post-exposure marker and it has only been 1 month. 

I started taking PReP to ease my anxiety, and it obviously isn't helping. I feel like a fucking crazy person. Should I be worried, or should I just shut the hell up?

Long story short, last Wednesday night at a kind of greasy night(strip)club i ended up getting like 10-15 seconds of unprotected oral (blowjob) from someone working there, and now i'm scared absolutely shitless of having gotten some infection, more specifically HIV. I know that what i did was *really* **really** stupid, but i guess it can't be undone now. I can safely say there was no ejaculating involved.

I read somewhere that if you get an HIV-infection, some (like 50%) get cold-like symptoms during the first weeks. Sure enough, i got cold and a sore throat on Sunday morning and it's still going strong. I also read on the internet that it's practically impossible to get HIV from receiving oral, but i guess all i want is some kind of confirmation to this. I should also mention that the 10-20 seconds i received oral, was my first sexual experience during my 24 years of living, so the fact that i'm being paranoid is maybe just because i'm really really inexperienced.

Need some more unbiased opinions.

For background, I received my HIV diagnosis in 2015 and caught it very early after infection. I have been Undetectable (UD) since 2015 and have coped with everything by essentially forgetting about my status and telling no one and silently taking my pill every night in secret.

Right now, I am in a situation with my boyfriend and I know it is self-created and I am at fault. I have not seen anyone since my diagnosis in 2015 but prior to that I had a few boyfriends. I started seeing my current boyfriend in January of this year. It quickly developed into something special and now I love him deeply and care about him immensely and the feeling is mutual. I am his first serious relationship.

The problem is that I have not told him about my UD HIV over the past several months. I know this is my fault and I know I couldn't hurt him physically with it during sex because I am UD and not infectious. However, clearly this is a huge breach of trust. I had not thought about it much as I have been dismissive of my status for all these years except for taking my medicine but it has been bothering me a lot lately. I don't know what to do. I love him deeply and don't want to hurt him or cause undue stress for him. He is the greatest guy and I know I will never find another like him and it pains me to have this burden on myself and the potential to cause him huge amounts of stress as well.

Additionally, I have never told anyone and I don't want this to get out to my friends/family if I tell him and mark me as a pariah. Part of me thinks it would be a loving act to just let him go and not have him worry about this and allow him to find someone better who he wouldn't have to worry with. 

He is a very understanding, enlightened, and empathetic guy but I know this is kind of an unprecedented situation. Any thoughts or ideas on what I should do are appreciated. Or even what you would do if you were me. You can judge away, I am judging myself right now hardcore.

TL;DR - 

I have been seeing a guy for 7 months and things have been going great and we love each other a lot. 

The problem is that I haven't told him that I have Undetectable HIV (or anyone for that matter because I am ashamed) and I know this is a huge breach of trust and it's deceitful. I don't know how I should proceed. 

Moving forward - Should I tell him or let him go out of love and say nothing/allow him to move on to a better guy who he won't have to deal with this with?"

So I've compiled a few sources for information on HIV - everything an ignorant gay man might have wanted to know but was too terrified of premature death to ask.

[NHS - HIV and AIDS: what are the risks for gay men?](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/sexual-health/hiv-and-aids-what-are-the-risks-for-gay-men/) - the UK's National Health Service giving you a basic overall view of the need-to-knows

[HIV.gov HIV information centre](https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics): Goes into more details, FAQs, infection rates, methods of transmission, treatment etc etc

[Avert.org: How do you get HIV?](https://www.avert.org/hiv-transmission-prevention/how-you-get-hiv)

[Planned Parenthood: HIV and AIDS](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/stds-hiv-safer-sex/hiv-aids)

These are (to the best of my ability) all reliable sources *from experts* to answer all your HIV questions.

If anyone else has any better ones *from reliable sources*, let me know in the replies and I'll add it.

I washed it out quickly with water and we carried on later. I realise that HIV risk is essentially zero from kissing - but I can't find much information about blood in the mouth.

codqkw,False negative HIV test. I'm one of the few people who take longer than 3 months after exposure to test positive. 19 years old.,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/codqkw/false_negative_hiv_test_im_one_of_the_few_people/,RenegadeRaider99,19,8/9/2019 21:54,137,/r/askgaybros/comments/codqkw/false_negative_hiv_test_im_one_of_the_few_people/,Not a question,"I would like to apologize beforehand to anyone who may feel opinionated, or feel that I'm only making this post to misinform, or to help eradicate any fear. Furthermore, I think it's best to share my story into detail to eliminate any confusion. I was exposed to HIV March of 2018. I met an older gentleman at a hotel who I engaged in unprotected sexual activity with in exchange for money. I had responded to his post on Craigslist. Afterwards I felt shame and guilt, and a gut feeling that I had contracted something that I didn't have before the encounter. A week later I expirenced a rash on my torso. It was raised blotches and intensely itchy. I had already predicted at this point I was infected with HIV. I received my first HIV test (blood draw) 5 months later in August 2018 while I was completing a 90-day sentence in the County Jail. The results were negative. At this point I had realized my lymph nodes were swollen in my groin and neck area. I received more testing after my release. I chose to abstain from sex in fear that I would infect others. I would go to a free testing site weekly for testing where I would literally cry to the testers explaining my exposure and my symptoms and they all told me any test done 3 months after exposure is conclusive. I kept coming back negative with the Rapid 4th gen Alere Combo and the Insti test. I tested negative 1 year after exposure (March 2019) but still tested monthly afterwards. On national HIV testing day (June, 27) I had my blood drawn, from a testing truck, and received my results 2 weeks later. They were negative. My last negative test was on July 19, with the Insti test. I didn't find out about my status until recently when I had a PCR test done and they found traceable amounts of the virus in my blood. The staff at my local testing site told me I had to contact it 3 months prior to the test. I know I didn't but my story doesn't change my status. I don't know how common this is but I believe it's something that should be acknowledged."

 &gt; [Y]oung gay men experience HIV as *dystonic*— unexpected and foreign to their lives.  Because it is dystonic, young men typically shun HIV, and men under the age of thirty-five are much more likely than [older gay] men to express discomfort about relationships or sex with someone who is HIV-positive.  Seventy-nine percent of young men are “very or somewhat uncomfortable” with a long-term sexual relationship with an HIV-positive man; 89 percent feel similarly about casual sex with such a man.  What about a *nonsexual friendship* with a positive man?  Fully *40 percent* in this group describe themselves as very or somewhat uncomfortable with that possibility.  Younger men are— consciously— both unfamiliar with HIV and, by self-report, highly avoidant of it.  In contrast to this stated avoidance of HIV, 58 percent of HIV-negative younger-group men also reported unprotected anal intercourse in the twelve months prior to a CDC survey.  HIV testing levels are also low in this group and, as a result, so is proper early treatment of infection.  The CDC reports that 24 percent of otherwise healthy twenty-five to twenty-nine-year-olds progress from first diagnosis of HIV infection to clinical AIDS within twelve months.

Odets goes on to quote a 27-year-old HIV-negative gay man living in San Francisco in 2014, who describes the life of his HIV-positive friend Noah (about the same age):

&gt; He’s in pretty bad shape really—I don’t mean physically—because when you get HIV, that’s pretty much the end of your social life, especially sex.  Guys that we both know—I’ll be someplace with Noah, and they act like he isn’t there, they completely ignore him and talk to me.  It’s embarrassing, and I feel bad for him.  I’d bet he hasn’t had sex since he got it.  I see this all the time when I’m out with him, and it pisses me off.  It’s made me a lot more worried about getting it because I don’t want a life like that.  Once when I asked him about people ignoring him, he said, “It’s like turning forty—no one’s interested in you.”  People are sometimes really hostile to him—say things to him directly— and tell hm he was stupid and got what he deserved, and that kind of thing, and you know they’re doing the same things he used to do.  He closed his Grindr account because when he would tell people he was positive, he’d get all kinds of crap.  It’s that racist thing, and I think a lot of these guys think they wouldn’t be interested in anyone who was the type who would get HIV and therefore they won’t get it.  I used to have sex with much older guys—you know, in their forties or so—but I’ve stopped because I know a lot of them have HIV and I don’t trust them to be honest.  I think getting HIV is probably the worst thing that could happen to me.  I'm not worried about getting sick because I know that doesn’t happen anymore, but I’d definitely never have a boyfriend for the rest of my life.

The facts are that HIV continues to spread because the older generations of HIV+ men still choose to engage in sexual behavior with people of the younger generations while HIV+.

I’m very curious to know your opinions. You could also comment here. Some points:

* 1 - How safe do you think it is to take Prep and have bareback sex with strangers?
* 2 - A number of guys have licked my ass after fucking me or after inserting fingers. Although there was no visible shit, there sure was some, that’s some light form of scat. What do you think of scat?
* 3 - Do you personally believe the ideal form of relationship is open, you can have sex with whomever you want? Or is it better to have a closed monogamous relationship?
* 4 - The LGBT movement often promotes events where gays have easy access to parties, sex, drugs and orgies, pushing them to a hedonistic, individualistic and self-destructive lifestyle. Instead, it should concentrate on creating a social structure to stop marginalizing gays, include them in society by encouraging them to have steady partners, get married and build families. Do you agree?"

I'm a 19 year old gay guy and I approached this year the world of hookups with a very open eye about protection and safe sex, both fun but anxiety at the same time. Exactly one month ago I had a lookup with a guy that was visiting my city and I decided to give a go to it. I was the top and I both received oral sex and was the insertive partner in anal sex. Both were protected by a condom (for which I had the security of holding the empty space at the tip and making it fit right in my erected circumcised penis). After 10 seconds of quick oral sex I penetrated him and lubrificated with my saliva, for the whole thing (that was interrupted many times in order to change position and lubrificate) I felt the latex covering my penis and I didn't feel any snap or change in feeling that happens when the condom breaks, we also controlled it and it didn't have big tears or anything. Then I just nutted outside him and the thing ended up. I don't know why but 10 days after I had this irrational fear that the condom had like a tiny hole and I didn't see it and that I catched HIV or STIs', it was just my anxiety but I question u guys: am I safe? does a condom snap evidently and dramatically when it breaks (considering that any hole in a tight ass would have become a giant tear)?"

He told me he got checked within the past month and that he has nothing, but of course you have to take everything with a grain of salt. 

I went to the clinic today to get PeP and they didn't not give to me (not enough money, no scheduling, inability to share insurance [forced coming out] and inability to prove that I'm poor enough to qualify).

Anyway 2 year ago, March 5th 2017 I had unprotected sex (I know foolish) with a stranger who’s status to this day is still unknown to me. Around 5 and a half weeks later I had a terrible vomiting bug that lasted a few days. It eased off for a week or so then I got what I believe was strep throat/tonsillitis which lasted a good few days. 

I did actually get tested for HIV and hepatitis through a blood test from my vein that was taken at the doctors not a clinic.  somewhere between 2-7 month after my exposure I just can’t quite remember unfortunately, although I feel like it was closer to the 6-7 month mark and I tested negative for all. The reason for this post is because I seen a program on TV recently to do with HIV and it spoke about false negatives and how you should get tested at least twice to confirm your negative status. I have very severe anxiety and this kicked it all off again which is a pain. My question to you guys is do you think I should get tested again even after 2 and a half years? I suppose it’s worth noting I am very rarely ill, the last time I was properly sick was the 5-7 weeks after my sexual encounter, haven’t had a sickness bug since 2017! Also rather embarrassingly I haven’t had sexual intercourse since then. Another thing about HIV is  I’ve heard it can lay dormant for a decade which of course does my anxiety no good! 

So what do you guys think, worth a quick visit to the clinic for peace of mind, or do you think I’m beating myself up over nothing and letting my anxiety get the better of me, any help is greatly appreciated guys and again I’m sorry if this post isn’t suitable for this subreddit."

Our mutual friend, Eric caught HIV after his partner Tom cheated on him. It was all very emotional and horrible. It affected our entire friend group emotionally. The majority of us have cut ties with Tom. I have reached out to Tom, twice because he is a good friend of mine. I reached out both to understand why it happened but also to offer him some sort of support. I'm not condoning what he did but having HIV at 26 and losing your entire support group seems unbearable. 

My partner of 5 years knew of this that I have met up with Tom, but like I said I have known Tom since I was at university and we met up frequently for lunch. Now my partner has very bluntly said that if they (Tom and Eric) had this happen to them, how can he trust me and he doesn't trust that I'm choosing Tom's side (I'm not). To add to his suspicion, a few months back I suggested I move out and we live separately for various reasons, most of them had not much to do with him. 

He is now suggesting that I cheated, or that I'm planning too and has accused me of knowing of Tom's cheating all along because we hang out often. No matter what I say, he finds a way to twist it and make it seem like I'm being secretive or different than usual. It's all his own insecurities but it's driving me nuts. He's gone as far to demand that we both get tested to restore ""trust"". I have finally agreed to that, as ridiculous as it sounds but I'm angry that he's practically blaming me for what someone else did.

My partner had his fair share of experiences with infidelity, his parents and had his previous partner cheat on him. Regardless of all this, how do I ease his anxiety?"

I (male) had sex with a commercial sex worker (female) on July 21st 2019. It involved penetrative vaginal sex, titty fuck, and body to body massage. Also I sucked on her boobs. I wore a condom for the vaginal sex but didn't not have a condom on during the body to body massage when my dick could have come in contact with her vaginal fluids. Also I'm not sure if the condom slipped or broke during sex as it was my first time and I was very overwhelmed. The next day I became very paranoid about contracting HIV and consulted a sexologist (professionally qualified) who put me on PEP (Post exposure prophylaxis). I took the medicine for approximately 14-16 days after which I discontinued as I couldn't bear the side effects. Approximately 3 weeks after the incident I got sore throat, cold and cough which went away in a few days. A month after the incident I noticed a bit of a thrush on my tounge which was accompanied by bad breath. Also had a bit of a cold and cough during this period. I was also going through severe HIV anxiety during this period and couldn't not concentrate on my everyday tasks and work. Was very stressed out and connected everything that happened to me with HIV. After a while I started getting itchy rash like pimples on my forearms (10-15 pimples like bumps on each hand which when squeezed results in a transparent discharge). The pimples healed over time but new ones keep coming up till this day. This made me extremely paranoid and I got a HIV duo 4th gen test done on September 10th (1 month 20 days after the incident) which came back negative. Also I got an antibodies test done on September 12th (1 month 22 days after the incident) which also came back negative. When I spoke with the sexologist he told me that the results are upto 95% accurate but aren't conclusive before a period of 3 months. As I couldn't control my HIV anxiety I got a HIV 1 PCR RNA Qualitative test done on 22nd September (2 months after the incident) which again came back negative. But the incident happened in India where HIV 2 is also present but not as prevalent as HIV 1. I don't think the PCR test checks for HIV 2. But the rash like pimples still keep coming up and I got a small patch of tinea versicolor (fungal infection) on the backside of my torso. How likely is it that I have been infected by HIV? And what is the accuracy of the test results mentioned above? Should I be worried?

TL;DR (start):
I (Male, heterosexual) met a great girl whom I can emotionally connect with very well, has an “permanent problem” as said by her, I suspect it might be HIV+ based on her actions, she would not tell just yet until she’s ready and I want to be mentally prepared in case it actually is. 
TL;DR (end)

I’ve met this great girl almost a month ago and we’ve hit off really well and things are looking serious, but she has mentioned 2 weeks into our dating that she has a problem which she isn’t comfortable to broach yet. She did mention it’s a permanent issue, would affect having kids, and is generally a big dealbreaker.

We have had intimate moments from the second week but it has not gone past using our hands on each other. She would not do oral, and has disallowed me to go down on her, much less allow intercourse. She has also been very particular about me washing my hands thoroughly after I touch her bodily fluids before cleaning myself up after our intimate moments. She would remind me repeatedly not to touch myself after touching her. She would also not allow me to relubricate my fingers by putting it into my mouth after touching her inside. Once she had a cracked lip and it was bleeding, after helping her dab it dry I tried to give her a peck on the lips but she immediately pulled away.  

I have come to suspect she might be HIV+ and only she has only found out recently (she told me she found this issue out recently) . She would tell me eventually once she feels I’m more serious about her (which I am), though i feel that it should’ve been mentioned before we even initiated physical intimacy or when things are starting to look serious from both POVs. I can’t commit myself to a relationship with this hidden detail, and she wants to ensure I’m genuinely serious about her before she tells me, so that’s a tight spot. 

I have been reading quite a bit over the past week and have gotten myself familiar with viral loads, partner studies, U=U, ART, serodiscordant relationships, undetectability, PREP/PEP etc and despite what science has proven, there’s still quite a bit of anxiety within me coupled with the fact that she has yet to tell me specifically and I’m wary of respecting her comfort zone. Of course I understand that I may be entirely wrong in my suspicion, but I want to be mentally ready for it just in case it is. 

What it is like for those who are/have been in serodiscordant relationship(s)? Should I have been told earlier or let her have her own timeline to tell me? What can I do to show her my support should it be that she is HIV+? AITA if I wish not to further pursue this relationship due to her positive status if that is so?"

&amp;#x200B;

Today I had a consultation with a doctor because I was considering (and now am certain I will be) starting PrEP. Part of the consultation was educational, and he gave me a lot of new information and resources regarding HIV transmission rates, risks, and measures of protection. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of the main resources he showed me is \[this HIV risk estimator\]( [https://wwwn.cdc.gov/hivrisk/estimator.html#-\~mb|rai.stdn.stdp](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/hivrisk/estimator.html#-~mb|rai.stdn.stdp)) from the CDC. If you take anything away form this post, I hope you save this resource for yourself or anyone else who may not be well-educated about the spread of HIV.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the things I wasn't aware of at all, is that having STIs other than HIV - say Chlamydia, which is very common - increases your likelihood of contracting or spreading HIV. 

&amp;#x200B;

The receptive partner in anal sex has approximately a 1.38% chance of contracting HIV if the penetrative partner is HIV+ (not acutely - this is riskier). If one partner has another STI, this likelihood increases to around 3.5-3.7%. If both partners have an STI, which isn't uncommon, the risk increases drastically to more than 10% (the numbers on the tool haven't yet been updated to the most current research, according to my doc). The most serious situation occurs when both have an STI and the penetrative partner has \[acute HIV infection\]( [https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/prep\_gl\_patient\_factsheet\_acute\_hiv\_infection\_english.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/prep_gl_patient_factsheet_acute_hiv_infection_english.pdf) ), which is the early stage of HIV infection when someone is least likely to be aware of their positive status and may not yet even be showing symptoms. The risk in this situations is nearly a 70% chance of contracting HIV, which is terrifying.  Wearing a condom would only decrease your risk of contracting the disease back down to around 20%, whereas PrEP alone decreases the risk to 5.5%. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is all to say, I became a strong convert and advocate for PrEP today. I'd previously held out some skepticism because I thought that PrEP encouraged the spread of non-HIV STIs, and I figured that using a condom would be just as effective in preventing transmission as PrEP is; but it isn't, it's not even close."

Today I found out I'm HIV positive. Two nights ago my boyfriend revealed his own positive result, triggering my test.

We have been together for 8 years in a ""monogamous"" relationship.

I'm broken.

I didn't start living openly as a gay man until I was 24. I even didn't get sexual with a man until then. I started late, you can say. I've had around 20 partners, of which all but 2 were oral-only, 1 I had condom sex with, and the last, my boyfriend, is the only man I've been bare with.

How did this happen?

When I ""came out"", I told my Mom. She was worried about me. ""HIV is a thing, be careful."" I didn't take her advice, because I already had committed to being careful. I didn't need her advice. I'd done my research. I knew the risks. I planned on taking the least risks possible short of abstinence.

While blowjobs aren't ""safe"" from STD/STI, the risk of contracting HIV from them in comically low. There are no definate known infections from oral only. One stat I read today says the chance of a mixed status couple passing the virus from oral is 1% in a lifetime, while the chance of passing it via condom-on sex is greater!! So, I wasn't crazy to to avoid anal sex when I was single to protect myself, and even then, if I met a man who didn't know his status and expect condoms during the sex I wasn't going to have with him, well, he could go fuck off.

While I dated, I gave out blowjobs. When I hooked up, I gave out blowjobs. The first guy I had feelings took my virginity with a condom on. We didn't work out. The next time I had feelings, I used a condom again. Until we became boyfriends, got tested, and chose to be monogamous and bare.

I swear to you bros... I've kept up my side of this bargain.

Over the years, I've been incidentally tested again. In 2014 and 2015 I had an infection that appeared to be like Ghonorreah. Test returned negative and the antibiotics cleared it up, so we never looked harder. In 2017 I got a life insurance policy and had an HIV test. Negative. Didn't even sweat it, because why should I worry? Most of the last 8 years, though, I've been uninsured. Regular testing wasn't cost effective, especially when I saw no risk.

Not gonna lie, recently, our relationship hasn't been going great. I'm advancing my life, he is still stuck not further from where he was 8 years ago. This has caused tension... about money, about life goals, about next steps. I want a kid, to live out of country, to save up for retirement. He spends freely, so we never have extra, accrued a bunch of debt so he can't help pay for the bigger place we rent or the nicer things we should be affording at this stage. I feel he doesn't have enthusiasm for my goals, and his are non-existent. I wasn't sure where we were going. But I didn't think we had lost that covenant.

I'm gonna fess up. I have been struggling with a sleep disorder. That causes weight gain. I got the sleep disorder under control earlier this year and I've lost half of what I gained since we met, but I am still not the sexy man he got with 8 years ago. A while ago has stopped complimenting me and also stopped having sex with me. I can't blame him, I guess. But I wanted and craved someone to validate me. I joined a snapchat group of ""daddies and boys"" so my ""dad bod"" could be complimented. I wanted and needed someone to say I was cute/hot, even when I didn't feel that way. I will admit it: it was an emotional cheating. Yes, he found out. In turn, I made my situation worse, I suspect.

And tbh, if he had cheated, why was it without a condom? Did he not love me enough, even in our unhappiness, to protect me and himself? He swears he didn't cheat though. What if the first initial test was a false negative? He hasn't been tested since, even though I have. Could he have had it for 8 years?

I hate how attitudes around HIV have changed.

8 years ago, I'd say over half of gay porn included condoms. Some of us wouldn't watch condomless porn. I shook my head and expressed frustration with my boyfriend as I watched a generation of gaybies indifferent to the virus grow up. I watched as every porn company forwent the ""unsexy"" putting on of condoms and started to glorify condomless sex because their men were on PrEP. I've observed conversations online and in person how men who are on PrEP will otherwise throw caution to the wind. A friend says he lies to his partners about being on PrEP ""so they go bare"", and I'm like ""and what if they're lying too?"" Infections are skyrocketing among gay men again, and its because so many don't fear it. Because PrEP made us have a false sense of security.

I don't care if it isn't a death sentance anymore. I feared it. And somehow, I have it now.

I'm scared.

For one, I don't know how far along my infection is. I've researched so much about it in the last day. If its fresh in me, then I can hope to be undetectable in a few months of treatment. But what if I've had it for years? What if he has? What if it's progressed past the point it can be treated into undetectable status? The doctors say our tests to find out how advanced (or not) the virus is will take a goddamned month to complete. Over a month! A month of not knowing how fucked you are...

Also, I question what is next for me? Will I be able to adopt with HIV, or am never gonna raise a kid? Is it safe to live in another country when you have such a health problem that requires such important treatment? Are my dreams of running for political office smashed by the shame of the illness? I know they say its not a death sentence, but if this has been in me for a few years, it could be at the point where it could be.

And what about my bf and I?

He is being sweeter and nicer to me than he has for years. I want to interpret that as kindness and empathy but all I see in it is guilt. I've asked him, ""how did this happen to us?"" He swears he has been loyal. But I know for an absolute fact I have been physically only been with him and condomless only with him. I know this. So how the fuck?

And what if I decide that he had to give this to me? Do I assume he cheated? Do I pass judgement on us without proof?

And should I? If he told me tonight ""I cheated"" should I kick his ass to the curb?

I mean, I'm a marked man now. My dating pool just instantly shrunk immensely. I don't care if a guy PrEP &amp; an undetectable positive man are basically no danger to each other, that doesn't mean most men won't touch me now. So should I stay with this boyfriend, who I pretty much know infected me, who I very likely believe cheated on me, just because he is the best I can now get? I don't know if I have the strength to suffer through this alone, or if its better to forgive him and have a friend and partner to go through the journey together. Am I stuck with him, because I need him more than not?

I don't know. I don't know enough and won't for months. I don't know how my heart will handle this. I don't know if my body will. I'm so scared. So lost. So sad. So angry. So disappointed that all the sex I abstained from couldn't protect me from the only one who I chose to trust.

I'm ranting. I'm venting. I don't know what I expect to come from this post. But can I leave you with this, bros:

Get tested.

Even if you're in a relationship.

Regularly.

There were times in the last 8 years I was dirt poor, but it was $49 yesterday to seal my fate. $49 is worth it. Would've been.

It is not wrong to be tested, regularly, even if you're in a relationship, I now know. If he can't respect your desire to KYS, he doesn't deserve you. 

It is not wrong to be on PrEP, even in a relationship. Taking a pill daily sucks. I expect I'll be taking 5 or more 3x a day now. That sucks more. Who cares if you trust him? It takes one mistake. One misjudgement. One ""lets try a threeway"". One night too drunk to say no. One man to deny you that no, and too much shame to get PeP. Just fucking protect yourself.

And wear a fucking condom with people you don't absolutely trust.

And stop glorifying this condomless shit. Porn should have condoms. Erotica should celebrate protecting yourself. You should find the rubber as hot as not.

And maybe, for all us positive guys out there, get educated on your risk with us. In case I end up single, I still want and deserve love one day. I won't lie to you about my status. And I won't be risky, I promise. And know I wasn't nasty or careless and that I didn't do this to myself. I loved a man, and chose to trust him.

Have me in your thoughts, please.

And get tested."

I recent read a thread that got a lot of attention and I was a bit unsatisfied with the way PrEP was portrayed.

There's in question:
https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/dgpt2k/the_raw_unfiltered_thoughts_of_a_day_1_of_hiv/

PrEP is vital to the fight against this HIV/AIDS It can not be made to be seen as a vessel in which wolves wear as sheep's clothing. 

There will be men who tell you they are on PrEP and are not. This is why YOU should be on PrEP. Protect yourself! 

I know this individual is having a difficult time in their relationship and I sympathize. If his boyfriend cheated and infected him that is totally unacceptable. That's what a shitty person does. 

But, this is not a common occurrence. This didn't happen to OP because his boyfriend thought his other relations were on PrEP. This happened because his boyfriend WASN'T. He wanted sex outside of the relationship and didn't want to get caught. Taking PrEP would put his fidelity in question. 


PrEP is a tool to protect YOURSELF not a tool for others to protect you.


TL;DR
PrEP is amazing. It does more to stop new infections  than it could possibly do to create more. OP's situation sucks but it is not PrEP's fault. 

Take PrEP

Use condoms

Trust yourself before others"

I just want to share a story; I just recently moved to Berlin for my job. One thing that really caught my eye on Grindr was that there were a LOT of open relationships (almost every second guy) and a lot of HIV+ guys (I think it's great, that it's not taboo anymore and people are transparent about it). I also heard about all those sex parties, naked dancing to 'Schlager' and so on. I don't condemn this lifestyle, I just don't participate. But there was one cute guy on Tinder, we matched and we met at his place. We talked a lot and then started kissing. Then he stopped and told me in a calm manner that he's HIV+ and undetectable, that was a powerful and respectful move. We continued kissing, I was still feeling comfortable. But we didn't go any futher and honestly I can never imagine myself having sex with an HIV+ guy. Even if he's undetectable. I know, it's irrational, because the risk is higher with someone who assumes he's negative, without really testing. But I cannot. To neurotic. I don't know. I don't stigmatise HIV people, I respect them and treat them as everybody else, besides the one fact, that I could never have sex with them."

And I totally agree with the move. 

1. 16 year olds relationships rarely last. 
2. If you’re in a relationship that’s likely doomed to fail, you shouldn’t be dating someone with a lifetime disease
3. Even with prep as well as the fact the boyfriend may have that low low viral load... I feel like at 16 that’s kind of not the way? 

I’m aware of how low the risk is on prep if the bf has the non existent viral load but that doesn’t do anything to ease my mind. I couldn’t imagine what it would be like from the parents POV.

I am currently going through some unnecessary HIV Anxiety and would like assistance from anyone who has had this too.

I have been speaking with someone long distance and recently gotten serious now that we live closer together, before we talked I had a one night stand with a girl who is known to 'sleep around', this gave me HIV anxiety. I have not had symptoms and I got tested at 6 weeks and then again at 14 weeks (the latest test was a full medical for a Visa which included a HIV test - 4th gen). These tests were both negative, and i usually accept these results. However when I get closer to hanging out, my worries come back, i am scared the tests were wrong/inaccurate and i could pass it on.

​

How can I stop these worries/intrusive thoughts? How can I just accept these results?

Part of me thinks I just get very anxious because I really like them, alot of the time I'm happy but I hate having anxiety at the back of my mind ruining the good times

Thanks!"

I  meet this guy 3 years ago and hit it off but stuff didn’t workout and he was seeing other people and he got a boyfriend who he was in a relationship for about 7 months and we would talk but he would always go back to him  or someone else and he kept hurting me but I was in a haze and kept in contact with him .

Fast word to 2 months ago he had broken up with his boyfriend again  and he texted me and caught up , then he turned the conversation sexual and I was about hesitant at first but went with it.

I proceeded to ask the regular questions about his status and stuff , such as if he ever had gotten tested or what the deal was , his attitude quickly changed as he began to accuse me of making him feel bad saying he felt as if I was accusing him of sleeping Around with everyone . 

The conversation quickly died but we later talked  some days later but not in a sexual way and he then told me he went back with his ex which was not surprising at all . 
  
Two weeks ago he has again broken up with his bf and we start taking and meeting up and  we end up having sex . I had a condom on but as I pulled out I noticed it looked a bit loose on the top , he  took it off as soon as I pulled out without saying anything and he went home . Well I am looking for the condom and can’t find it or anything.

I message him as I start having a panic attack and is worsened when a good friend told me his ex boyfriend  has been rumored to be positive , I convinced my self to go the hospital and I’m explain and they start taking my vitals and I see the doctor and he says I’m going to the given 3 different pills and received 3 or 4 shots , and I finally start feeling better and I check out and I am given my prescriptions for isentres and truvada with a two days supply as I will then need it for about a month ,.

Well he still hasn’t answered and I wanted to fill the prescription and since I don’t have insurance and don’t qualify for anything I feel doomed as it’s close to 3k and I don’t know what to do . I tried looking for resources but there isn’t any near me than can do anything to help . 

I haven’t been able to sleep knowing that I might become infected  and feeling stupid and shitty for sleeping with him and he has now blocked me leading me to believe he might of been positive . 

I really don’t know what I’m hoping to accomplish by doing this post maybe someone can lead me in the right path or am I just overreacting."

I've had sex with a few partners since then as well, but always either oral only, or anal with a condom.

I've only ever barebacked in an LTR so I'm kind of freaking out right now.

Assuming he wasn't lying, and we are both negative, what actually are the chances I could contract HIV or any other STD from barebacking him? I also bred him I don't know if that makes a difference.

I’m really worried about this thing that happened, maybe 10 to 12 days ago. I had agreed to meet-up someone on Grindr (I was really horny at the time and needed to release some stress). He said I could come into his room (he was staying at a hotel) and said I could fuck him (which made me very excited). 

I knocked onto his and he came out and pulled me inside. I was shocked by what I saw. I saw other two guys in the bed, him excluded. He sucked me first and asked me to go into the shower. I haven’t had any condom or lubricant inside my pocket, but he made the soap as a lubricant to enter his hole inside my penis. I banged him. Then he told me to go to the bed. I was wary at this point for it may seem to become an orgy (which I didn’t plan) but I’m really horny, and needed a release so I didn’t care for a moment. The other two guys joined. The other guy sucked me until I cummed, also he tried to insert my penis into his hole but I didn’t have the energy to grind him so he withdrew. 

Days later, I’m noticing that when I pee, there is a burning sensation. I surfed through internet about it and came up with STD/STI’s specifically pointing about Gonorrhea. I haven’t had some discharge by that time, but lo and behold after few more days, I saw one and really got worried sick. Long story short, I came to the doctor yesterday and treated it with antibiotics. She gave me 1 cefixime and 2 azithromycin, only to be take in that very day. Today, no more pus cells or discharge coming out of the tip of my penis. Also, the burning sensation while urinating is now gone. 

Now I was wondering about HIV. It really scares me. Being in a third world country, many had died having it and that what’s really stressing me out lately. I can’t properly sleep (Just like after I knew about my suspected Gonorrhea) 

Can you get HIV if you are an Insertive and did not use condom that time?

And also, Can you get HIV and Gonorrhea ( or any other STD’s) at the same time?

Please enlighten me. 

PS. There are no exchange of body fluids happened about my recent sexual contact, just unprotected anal sex. I am an Insertive or what you call a Top. Refer to my story above for my sexual encounter. It’s the first time I didn’t used a condom and bingo, I got a Gonorrhea to take home."

I’m just scared when I lose my virginity if my boyfriend will have any diseases? How common is it to contract  hiv without hookups? I’m becoming a doctor so that would be harsh on my career. If I ever have sex I want to take it slow, is it offensive if I just ask him if he is positive? Do I explicitly say it? Or implicitly ask him?"

We also makeout and he drop his saliva into my

He was talking about living with HIV and he said if you have it you have to be very careful with your health because you can get sick extremely easy and you shouldn't even go out with wet hair because you'll get sick. Doesn't AIDS do that? And you get AIDS if you have HIV and don't treat it for a while. Yet he was talking about HIV.

Hey bros ! 😊

About 4 weeks ago, I’ve hooked up with a guy, and long story short the condom completely broke, but I noticed it only at the end when I pulled out, since the room was extremely dark.

While I was not very concerned at first, the more he was telling me about his sexual practices, the more anxious I grew : I decided to go to the ER (which you have to do in my country to get the post-exposure prophylaxis), where the MD prescribed me the treatment.

The guy seems to have been offended by my questions regarding his status and is not responding to me anymore: I don’t have any idea what his HIV status is and/or if he is on PrEP / treatment (if he’s HIV+).

So I have been taking this PEP for the last 4 weeks, which is basically the medication you should take when you’re HIV+, that can lower de chances of getting infected with HIV, provided you start taking it within hours (best in the 4 hours following the exposure, and until 36/48/72 hours following the exposure, depending on what the health authorities in your country advise.

I’ve already had one blood test right after, and I’ll get one at the end of the treatment, and another one two months after the second one (again, that’s how it is where I live) : only the results of the last one will tell me whether I’m HIV+ or HIV-. In the meantime, I’ve decided not to have sex (even though I only have protected sex anyway).

I’m aware that after getting contaminated (seroconversion phase), the viral load is extremely high in the following weeks, making you even more likely to pass HIV.

I’m especially talking about unprotected oral sex, which is a very unlikely way to pass HIV, but could still be, especially when you’re at the very contagious stage.

**So, my question is: while PEP is supposed to prevent to help you prevent getting infected by HIV, do you guys know whether it also prevent you from passing HIV?**

I’ve gone through quite a lot of resources, but I still haven’t found the answer I was looking for…

I insist on the fact that I won’t have sex anyway (and certainly not unprotected), since I don’t want to put anybody at risk, but the question is still bothering me.

Also, I know I probably should have been on PeEP, and I’ll be if I’m still HIV- after the last blood test I’m supposed to have.

Thank you guys very much !"

I had no problems with that, I like this guy A LOT and sex is something I can wait for, I figured he just needed some other type of support in the meantime. 

For very unrelated reasons we broke for a month at the end of this past August, and got back together in October. Now we're getting way more frisky as he's been on treatment consistently and is more comfortable. 

It's great, that dude's got some magic fingers lemme tell you. But we haven't fully done the deed as I notice whenever I touch his dick, he tends to go limp and I can kind of feel his body language change and tense up, so I ease off and we continue foreplay and then snuggle and sleep. 

I'm ok with this currently, but I have a hunch he's maybe feeling insecure or self conscious about sex since finding out and going all the way kind of makes him freak out?

I would really like to talk to him about it, and let him know hey dude it's A-okay with me. We can take it at whatever pace is comfortable for both of us and keeps us both safe but just unsure how to broach the subject.

e4hw2y,It's World Aids Day. Here's some advice on living and thriving with HIV,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/e4hw2y/its_world_aids_day_heres_some_advice_on_living/,HFR27,1,12/1/2019 6:11,45,/r/askgaybros/comments/e4hw2y/its_world_aids_day_heres_some_advice_on_living/,Not a question,"1 December is World Aids Day. It can be confronting to see all those images from the 80s and memories of those who died. We're in a different world now, yet many people still avoid being tested or stigmatise others living with HIV. So I'm (re)posting my updated advice on living and thriving with HIV from someone who's been positive and (now) happy for over a decade.

Think long and hard who you will tell. You don't owe the world, or anyone, an explanation, and you can't untell. You don't need to be a flag waving advocate to have value. 

Don't be afraid to change doctor. There's some nice ones and not nice ones out in the world, don't suffer for no reason. 

When new and better pills come out think about changing. Upgrading your treatment is your right, and it can have significant benefits long term. 

Don't get hung up on the numbers. Viral loads can fluctuate from time to time. It's totally normal and you're still undetectable. Anything under 2,000 copies is fine. 

Don't neglect your ""other"" health; from weight to smoking to that ingrowing toenail you never dealt with. You're entire health doesn't revolve around HIV. 

Connect with other positive people in the community and listen to them. There's an enormous gulf between what a doctor tells you and the actual lived experiences of human beings. 

Re-infection isn't real. Not when you're on treatment, anyway. Don't be afraid of sex. If it's nerve wracking at first, go slow or find other HIV positive people to re-learn the ropes with. But you are entitled to an amazing sex life and there's no reason you can't have it. 

Undetectable = untransmittable. There's never been a transmission from an undetectable person. It's a fact. And it's safer than PrEP. 

Treatment is more than a pill, it's acupuncture, mental health therapy, exercise, massage, self-care, etc etc. Don't neglect it or think the semi annual visits to the clinic are all you need to do to take care of yourself. 

You deserve happiness, so cutting out negative people, jobs, family members, or removing yourself from bad situations is always going to be the answer, trust yourself. 

Sometimes love isn't worth it, and sometimes they aren't worth your love. 

If you're being the best version of yourself, or working towards it, you're doing things right. 

If you can, keep a little reserve of pills around. An extra months supply is a nice buffer to have (oh pharmacist I'm going away, next month, can you give me early?). 

Imagine how you want your life to look in 1 or 5 or 10 years time, then work backwards from there. 

You are strong. Stronger than 99% of other people you will meet. Be strong and be fierce in your own way. 

You'll have sex. And better sex, than you EVER did when you were negative. 

And the best thing? You'll never have the anxiety of taking another HIV test again!

Happy living, my fellow HIV+ gaybros!"

So i (16M) has unprotected piv sex for about 10 seconds, then i put a condom on with a girl (16F)

About 2 weeks after this i started getting mild flu like symptoms which could easily be caused my stressing about the fact that i might have caught something, but i still had unprotected sex so i was still at risk.

About 3 weeks after the exposure i had tested negative via a rapid test at planned parenthood, and yeaterday i tested negative at 86 days after exposure via oraquick.

I was wondering if i can rule my negative results as conclusive or is further testing required?"

I'm sure that you guys get this type of thing often and it probably gets to a certain point where many of you are tired of this type of post interfering with your community. I had protected, short receptive anal with a MTF pre-op trans sex worker. I got ejaculate in my eye though.

I went for PEP at a hospital in NYC where I received an initial HIV test upon arrival, one at the end of the PEP regiment (which I strictly adhered to) and once more an estimated 1.5-2 months after the completion of PEP. It was at this point that all tests came back negative and they infectious diseases department said that I was good to go and HIV free. Anxiety is definitely becoming a problem for me because I read that PEP can delay seroconversion and a confirmatory test at 6 months is recommended by a few other sources. NYC and NY state run a policy where the third and final test is confirmation that you do not have HIV. I'm still nervous. I have not had any other high sexual encounters.

 I never had any acute infection symptoms as far as I'm aware until I had a single lymph node swell (7 months after incident) in my neck with no other symptoms. The swelled lymph node has gone down significantly over the course of a couple days - but I really just need to know for anyone who may have experience if that 1.5-2 month period after completing PEP and still being negative is a confirmatory indicator. Granted, this is 7 months after the incident. Any insight will help. Thank you and I apologize ahead of time for this type of post."

So im a 23 year old bi guy who had never done anything with another guy. I've had limited sexual encounters with girls, always protected and have tested negative for STDs.

&amp;#x200B;

Around 2 months ago I started talking to this guy and things have gone well. We started going on dates, seeing each other multiple times a week, staying over at each others houses, cooking and drinking with each other and doing everything except from actual anal sex. At around the one month mark we got carried away and things got heated and he directed my junk towards his trunk. Now we had no condom available and even though i was tentative at start, he assured me he was HIV-, is on PrEP and that he hasnt had sex with anyone during the time he has known me. He even showed me a text message from the sexual health clinic dated 2 weeks prior saying he was negative.  Also showed me the PrEP tablets.

&amp;#x200B;

Probably stupidly, I then agreed to proceed since up until that point things were going well and i knew it wasn't just a hook up with a random stranger. I felt like i could trust him so i did. The worry starts with me having flu like symptoms (fever, sore throat, runny nose etc) about 8 days after intercourse. I have a swollen lymph node on one side of my neck and multiple mouth sores. At first i figured it was just a standard flu but i do recall me having a couple of scrapes around my junk due to bad shaving. Then i found out that he was active on grindr the whole time meaning he could have possibly lied about having other sexual partners. He also went abroad about a week prior to us having sex. Then i started googling stuff and the results have freaked me out about me possibly contracting HIV. Im honestly freaking out and its been around 13 days since the first time we had sex. The flu has passed but i still have mouth sores and a swollen lymph node. I would greatly appreciate it if someone can point me in the right direction."

I’m not him. Well maybe a little lately. So, yeah I’ve been sleeping around a little, you know experimenting with people and kinks and whatnot. Well Friday after talking to this guy on Grindr for a few days (maybe 3-4) we decided we go for drinks.  He had mentioned the night before we were going out for drinks that he was undetectable. That’s cool w me, I have friends and family who are. I didn’t think much of it, I suppose. Somewhere trendy on king st. (hate the idea of it). If you knew me king st. is not my preferred area. Well he messages me saying he’s got a few bottles of wine at his house instead and just to come there. Two things about me: I usually wanna grab a beer in a public atmosphere w someone from Grindr or scruff to just chit chat a little, make sure their not crazy (no science behind this) and two I’m a pushover who doesn’t really speak up (stranger or friend). 
So I went over. He was weird. Definitely not what I had imagined through the pictures and everything. Not to say I’m some gorge sexy beast denying everyone. But was not my thing. We talked for what felt like forever and I just wanted to leave, y’know? When you just can’t be the same room as this guy. Why am I here kinda scenario?! So I had sex w him (felt like I couldn’t just leave, again, people pleasing). I wore a condom. I topped he bottomed. It was alright. I left. 
Where I’m from is cold like most others right now. We’re in the beginning of winter. But Sunday I woke up w a cough and sore throat. I’m sus. I get colds all the time. However, idk the back of my head is going a mile minute thinking the worst. I feel awful for thinking it could possibly be HIV infection instead of just the flu. Everyone around me is catching flu right now, but my mind is running to worst case scenarios. I’m getting a rapid HIV test and praying (I’m an atheist) for the best. Never in my sexual life have I felt this panicked. I haven’t slept w anyone since him just out sheer fright of putting someone else the fear I’m currently going through"

They quickly drew blood and sent it out for a confirmatory test and said the results would come back tonight. When i got the diagnosis from the rapid test i was defeated and went through so many emotions of literally grief. I was grieving my own life. The clinic told me that the test is 99% accurate. I have a boyfriend who has been loyal to me (as i to him but had ONE hook up during a break we had for roughly three weeks where i received oral, i told the clinician this and they said ""well relationships aren't air tight and if the hookup guy had open sores in his mouth he could have transmitted it during that encounter"". I began researching the illness and was able to find a lot of supportive people on subs like this one and was beginning to come to terms with my new lifestyle. I walked into the clinic tonight ready to have the official diagnosis and it turned out the test was a false positive, the confirmatory test proved i was negative. I cried. 

I know hiv is not a death sentence and now realize just how manageable it is from the research i was doing. I will now forever be someone who actively changes the stigma of hiv and aids. I also want to add i hope this wasn't insensitive to those who do have the illness, I just am so much more aware of the lifestyle and learned a lot going through this. If anyone is wondering why I tested false positive I did mention to the clinician that literally two weeks before getting tested I got the flu vaccine which causes the body to create antibodies which may have triggered the positive on the rapid screening test. I really wanted to get this off my chest... get tested know your partners status if they're hiv positive ask them if they are undetectable, know your status and your future sexual partners'."

1. How long after HIV infection did someone progress to AIDS in the 1980s? Is there a way they may not have known for years they had HIV/AIDS until they’re on their deathbed?

2. How quickly did someone typically die from AIDS in the 80s? Would a disease such as pneumonia be the main cause of someone passing so suddenly? Thanks."

The following week, I began to have a mild throat and ear pain and chest pain and stomach pain (the stomach pain probably came from my horrible anxiety, because I couldn’t eat). 

A month later, when I brushed the papillae slightly they went down and so did the raised bumps in the back of my throat (lingual tonsil, maybe) went down too. Now, I only experience a sore throat sometimes or earache when I come in contact with cold air. 

Note: I work outside in the cold, so maybe it’s a different infection that caused the bumps and other symptoms. Also, I developed a crack on the side of my lip the same week I developed the bumps on tongue, but I had a crack on the side of my lip years ago because I have very bad chapped lips, and the crack on the side of my lip went away as well.

I need a piece of advice over here. Please halp

I discovered I was HIV+ on July 2018. My ex-boyfriend at the time was having some extra credits if you know what I mean and after we broke up I went to get some testing after feeling ill for a bit and then there was that. Damn, it still boggles me.

I dated a guy since, who was very helpful concerning this issue, but who ended up being really toxic and predatorial, taking advantage of the facts;
1 being there for me when I most needed, since we discovered it togheter 
2 being the only person who knew
3 being an asshole

One year later and a few months of therapy in between I got to break up with him and I’m feeling great ever since. And so came Peter..

I met this guy some weeks ago and we’ve been talking and hanging out. He is great, charming, nice smile, cute accent, hilarious, and shit. 
I’m falling for him. And so is he. 

I literally forgot how it was nice to be treated so nicely. He is amazing. 
However, he doesn’t know (yet) about my status. 

We don’t live in the same city. I’m on vacations on his town and I’ll leave in 10 days. We haven’t had sex yet, we met like 4 times to have dinner or grab a beer. We’ll meet in my city one month after I left since he’ll go there on a business trip. 

He already mentioned seeing me or either staying at my place (after my invitation). 

Well, we still have 10 more days to go and we’ll most likely have sex. I haven’t had sex with anyone after the previous relationship (or with someone who didn’t know about me) so I’m having mixed feelings about this. 

I would rather loose him than have sex and “come out” later to him to have him feeling I betrayed his trust somehow, so that’s not an issue. 

I would just like to know how to approach this, how to mention this. So far only my best friend knows it, it won’t get to my city because we live some states apart, it’s all a matter of handling this well. 

He is amazing, I feel like he would be startled, a little sad for me being in this situation but I feel he wouldn’t “mind”. He’s from a rural area, so there’s also that, but he seems like a very gentle guy. He even brought Pose up when we were talking series we saw recently. Not ignorant about history, you see.. 

How should I? When should I? Now, next month? Should I? I can see us together, or at least trying to, given the distance. 

How to approach this, bros? Thanks"

Hi everyone. I’m a sexual active young gay man. I admit I have been careless with multiple partners and have engaged in unprotected sex with a handful of guys in the last month. I’m nervous I contracted hiv. Usually, I don’t let these fears consume me but this is the first time I’ve shown any symptoms. Typically I poop every couple of days. However, over this last month I have had diarrhea nearly every day, often multiple times a day. 

Additionally, I recently tested positive for gonorrhea and chlamydia. They also tested me for hiv and I came back negative. The test was a finger prick. However, the questionable encounters happened 15-33 days before I was tested so I doubt a finger prick test will actually be able to tell if I have hiv. Am I wrong? 

During the time in question, I was taking prep irregularly and inconsistently. I’d often just take it when I remembered or after a sexual encounter. I am currently on it regularly. 

What would you say the chances are that I have hiv? Is there anything I can do to be more conclusive or do I just play the waiting game?"

I've read multiple different times upwards of 5 days.

I travelled South Africa in November - we rented an Air BNB in Cape Town and the house had maids working. I was sunburnt and my skin was peeling, so when I took a shower that night i rubbed myself hard with the towel. After the shower I put on a white tshirt. When I went to bed and took of the shirt, I saw blood spots on my shirt. I believe I scratched a spot on my back as I have quite bad back acne. The blood was from the inside of my shirt, and I checked the towel and found blood on it. I believe there was blood on more than one towel (unless I wasn't thinking straight!)

It is quite a stereotype that the Maids have AIDS/HIV. My worry is that the blood I found on the towel could have been from them from when they were doing the laundry before we arrived.

If the blood was from a HIV+ maid, could this blood have got into my bleeding spots and cause me to contract HIV? I do not believe I have had any symptoms, but ive also read not everyone has symptoms.

I’m a black Transman who is attractive and in shape. I’ve been on Grindr and Jack’d for a long second and its be just aight. Random hookups are plentiful but finding a FWB has been difficult. I only sleep with black gay/bi men and most are either dl or disinterested in anything consistent.

My issue is that I met a guy who has expressed a desire for FWB but he is HIV positive. Although I’ve been on Prep for a minute I still don’t feel comfortable sleeping with someone I know is positive. It’s like I’ve heard the statistics about HIV prevalence in the gay community but having someone actually say they are positive is making me question if hooking up with him is worth it. Idk how to explain it, but knowing he is positive is messing with my anxiety in ways that not knowing wouldn’t. Intellectually I know that Prep and condoms means I’m protected really well but emotionally I’m still scared. My feelings are also complicated by the fact that I’ve had two different men lie to me about their status. I don’t know what to do.

I know the stigma and I don’t want to contribute to it but at the same time its scary to sleep with someone I 100% know has an STI. I don’t want to make long term permanent decisions on temporary feelings. 

Has anyone here had sero-discordant relationship? How did you manage you anxiety and you are negative and they aren’t? Are you still negative?"

In June 2018, I met a guy on a hookup app that resulted in me giving him fellatio in a public washroom. He seemed clean, so I went ahead with it, and blew him until he ejaculated in my mouth. I spat out his cum. 

Fast forward to a week later, and got an iffy stomach, fever, and a white tongue. It went away in a few days but I didn’t think too much about it. 

Since Jan 2019, I had stomach problems again. Some mornings I have super soft poop, and some days I’m constipated. But it wasn’t enough to worry me. 

I’ve also had a dull pain in my leg that comes and goes since then. 

 Over the last 2-3 days, I’ve been having random muscle pain and joint pain, near my elbows and and biceps, and also my legs. 

After googling my symptoms I can’t help but think this has to do with me contracting HIV. Do you think this may be true?

It was pretty fun, but the condom was really tight and a huge hassle to deal with, so we both(mistakenly) decided not to bother and just do away with it. I came in him on the night(he wanted me to, don't worry, still a bad idea). Immediately after we went for a shower and he douched a bit to try and wash it out, we thought it might reduce risk. Well, the morning after he erupted with these weird spots on his body. We kinda just rubbed it off at the time, but eventually it got *much* worse over a couple weeks. He went to the doctor and found out he had this thing called ""Erythema Multiforme"" which is essentially a skin condition that is caused by an infection of some sort...the most common one being herpes. So we both kinda chalked it up to that, and the doctor said not to worry at all and it should go away. Boyfriend said he's had coldsores in the past so it was definitely a possibility that it was just a weird reaction to that, at an extremely bad time. 

However, he started getting a bit more concerned because the spots weren't going away as quickly or easily as the doctor said they would. So he went to a different one and also got some blood tests at the same time. That was yesterday, and today he got a call from his doctor and essentially his doctor said that he should come in and have a talk with the doctor about the blood tests...and that's scaring me because it sounds like it's going to be bad news. I feel absolutely terrible for him because there's this possibility that *literally* our first time ever could possibly damage his life forever if it's HIV or anything permanent...it just breaks my heart and I can't imagine how scared he is now. Neither of us have had any sexual contact with anyone else, so we definitely haven't got/given each other anything we may have got from someone else. If anyone could shed some light on this...maybe clear my head a bit and give me more information on this I'd be really grateful. I'm just scared, I guess. I want to give him a hug."

At the time, I took the gen4 HIV test 25 days after the initial exposure and results came back negative in a day. Told myself I'd wait an extra 2-3 weeks to restest and make sure, then get on PrEP once I get a conclusive result. 

It's been 2 weeks since that test and I'm gearing up to go back for another test. I'd be lying if I said I still wasn't a bit nervous. I've heard with the new test, it's pretty much 99% chance of accuracy at 28 days. I was at 25, so I'd imagine (and hope) the test would be pretty much be accurate enough, but I want the reassurance before I start downing these prep pills."

I downloaded Grindr for the first time this semester and got especially carried away this past month - I almost always play safe, but I slipped up a few times after I went on Grindr tipsy. I'm really stressing out about all the dumb decisions I made earlier this month and figured I'd ask for advice/help/guidance here.

I'm super worried about three hookups that all happened about a week or two ago:

1) I hooked up with another guy at my school. All we did was make out and swap head, and I swallowed after he said he was neg. I guess I thought because he was also a college student at a fairly competitive school, the odds of him having HIV were low? There's definitely a lot flawed with that logic but that was what went through my head at the time.

For the second guy, I bottomed - during the hookup the condom broke, but he didn't cum, and he said he was neg and on PReP, and just been tested earlier this month.

The third hookup, I bottomed again, but this time with no condom - the hookup was happening really fast. While he was topping me, I started getting really paranoid so I stopped it and left, and he didn't cum.

It's been two weeks since all of that, and I've felt a few very very light aches in my arms (which could just be because I sleep in weird positions sometimes?), my forehead has been a little warm the past couple days, and I've been a little lightheaded on and off. I'm really stressing over if this is just my persistent cold I've had all semester or early HIV symptoms or coronavirus incubating - I don't know. I'm freaking out a lot, and if I test positive I'm afraid it'll ruin career opportunities for me in the future. Help? Advice? What's the earliest I can use a home test and have it be accurate, and where can I get home test kits?"

I'm 29M, not a smoker or drinker. I'm on Escitolopram for Depression. No other co-morbidities.

My exposure was about 102 days ago. I recently tested negative twice using Oraquick but I'm not entirely convinced I'm negative. Would it be worth the COVID risk at this moment to go in for a Rapid HIV finger prick test or would I just be duplicating the Oraquick"

I’m having trouble securing testing in Salt Lake City. 

I’m trying to get the Alere Determine™ HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab Combo test because it has a 4 week exposure window and my current exposure is greater than 4 weeks but less than 3 months and I’m eager to get my results. 

The Utah AIDS Foundation has suspended testing and Planned Parenthood told me they don’t have this specific test. 

I called the Salt Lake County Health Department and left a message, but they haven’t gotten back to me. 

I don’t have a primary care physician. 

Does any one know of any other resources I can use to get this specific test ASAP? 

Thank you very much for your help."

In a few months I will be turning 43. Over a year ago I left my partner of over 15 yr. I took some time to find me and I’m ready to date again. 

So I was on tinder and matched with a guy that actually responded back and we have been talking ever sense. That’s about all we can do since we are quarantined. Plus he works in healthcare so is ever more important now to keep the distance. 

So a little back story, when I got HIV, it was another time. Literally, not to many people know of my hiv status and I keep everyone at a distance. I don’t really don’t have close friends. That’s mainly cause of my ex. It’s been one big secret so when it comes to dating it scares the ever living shit out of me. 

So we have a lot of similarities and we talked about meeting when all of this is over. Well today he said he want to cut ties. Which I found off, since we haven’t met or even dated. To be honest the more I chat and talk with him, I actually starting to like him. 

One thing with me, I rather prefer an honest answer then a sugar coated one. So I ask him, what’s up, Im a big boy and I need to know why. I won’t get mad, I just need to know the reason why to have closure. 

He pretty much said he is liking me more and more that we talk but he’s scared because he is HIV POSITIVE. I came clean and told him I was undetectable also and not to shut me out. 

So where do I go for here. If it doesn’t work is it still hard to date with HIV as it was 16 yr ago. Any thoughts and advice would be helpful cause I know how this guy is feeling. I’m scared shitless also. Will a 16 yr abusive relationship all that I will have the rest of my life."

I am extremely honored because I am actually the first person he has come out to.  Over the last few days I recalled a conversation we had a year ago.  He has symptoms of an autoimmune disorder.  He always seems to be sick with colds, routinely has mouth ulcers, and recently has developed some psoriasis.  We spoke about it once and he was like ""oh when you said autoimmune I thought you meant AIDS"", and I brushed it off.  I was thinking maybe lupus, and honestly since he never put much effort into girls, I figured he hadn't had a lot of sexual contact.  In this new context I am a bit worried.  The thing is, he is from a country where homosexuality only became legal in 2018, and he has been with men.  I did a bit of research and his country has the 3rd worst AIDS/HIV epidemic.  I plan to tell him to get tested, but I'm not sure how to frame it.  So my question is this: in America, if you are dating as a gay man, how often do you get tested?  Is it normal to ask a partner to see ""papers"" certifying a recent clean test?  Any other advice on dating as a gay man in America, or how to support him?"

Needed a place to express what i’m feeling.

I am 17 and a senior in high school, late February of this year some college kids from a state university were throwing a bonfire at the beach. My friends convinced me to go and off we went . I wasn’t good emotionally due to family problems so I tried to drown it all away with the help of alcohol ( extremely stupid on my part I know). As the night went on I met this guy from the college, we began to make out and things escalated. I was so out of my senses I could hardly walk, causing me to fall and trip over countless times. You could probably guess what happens next, I tried to fight him off but I had no strength, all he would say to me is  “It’s okay i’m clean”
  
 All I could remember is him only inserting his tip and pulling out afterwards. Few days later I experienced a really bad sore throat, ear pain, and mild fever. I didn’t think much of it and just thought it was an ear infection. I tried my best to forget about the events, but this past week i’ve been nothing but a paranoid mess. I’ve searched up symptoms and they matched the ones I had. I saw a CDC document that confirms there is only a 1.48% to contract HIV through bottoming, but this didn’t my mind to ease. I’m going to my Dr next Monday  and i will be asking for a test. I really have no one to blame but myself. I have done something so stupid and i’ll never be able to take it back. I still have a sense of hope that everything will be fine, but my anxiety takes over. I never thought I would be in this situation and that my first time would go like this.

 Really  hoping the test won’t come out on my family’s medical bill and i’ll get a negative result. Writing this down has made a me feel a bit better and thank you for reading this far. Any feedback is welcome, thanks bro’s. :,)"

I had protected with and I was the top. We did blowjobs (no cum) and rimming. The person claims is clean. I came in the condom which verified the condom was still good (the person put on the condom).

Day 1: Next day I felt a tingling in my lip and i figured something is for sure wrong

Day 2: Tingling went away but muscles feel tense and hurt and goes away quickly

Went to 3 major hospitals. (2 didn't know what is PEP and the third said only for rape victims)

Day 3: My throat is stiff, doesn't hurt to swallow at all. tiny bit of random chill. sweat more than usual but not too much at night.

Day 4: Throat got a lot stiffer, i checked the glands at a doctor and said they are fine. night sweats happens during my sleep only based on armpit smell. 

Day 5: Throat continued to get even stiffer and now i started to feel weaker and a headaches are taking over. No chills though.

Other symptoms: I lost food appetite, can't get hard

At this point I'm at full panic, doctor said we can't test for HIV yet wait 2 weeks at least, but they took urine sample for common STDs. Those don't feel feel like a flu, Guys I really need your advice here and experience!"

And even before that it was probably late February the last time I had.

But this morning I got a call from an ‘Unknown ID’ caller. Iffy so I just let it go to voicemail. I checked my voicemail and it was a woman asking if I could ring back on a number. I googled the number and nothing came up. I thought it might be a scam but it seemed pretty elaborate so I chanced it and rang back.

The lady that answered the phone seemed so so nice, like a comforting Aunty. She said that they would like to schedule me in for a Sexual Wellness Test. I was a bit shocked to say the least, I’ve had one boyfriend of 6 months and have slept with 3 people in total so I don’t exactly get around a lot. 

Then she said possibly the worst thing I could’ve heard. The sexual illness that you’ve come into contact with is HIV. I nearly passed out. Today I’d started a new project at my work, was planning on relaxing and studying for an exam this evening. Life was pretty good. 

Instead I’m imagining the worst possible news again and again. I know the only person I could’ve got it from. It was the first time I’d ever bottomed. I asked to use a condom but they just brushed it off. I feel like such a fucking idiot, it’s completely my fault if the news is bad.

I know it’s not the end of the world. But at 19 it sure as shit feels like the end of my world. So now I’m just sat. Shell shocked. The pizza I was planning to have for lunch is burnt and cold and I’m trying to come up with a reason to tell my parents why I need to leave for a few hours in the middle of a pandemic. 

I’m sure what I want from this post. I just wanted to put it words and process my how I’m feeling. I’ve got so much anger at the person that could’ve possibly given it to me.

TL; DR, at the bottom.

First off I’d like to thank each and every person that reached out via PM or left a supportive comment. I’m still reading them and will try to respond to as many as I humanly can.

The last 48 have been possibly the most tumultuous and stressful of my life. In all honesty I spent most of the day after I found out in a zombie eque state. I didn’t have anybody in real life I wanted to talk through it with but there was some solid advice given in the comments that I really took to heart.

So yesterday morning I made some excuses about needing a blood test for an unrelated issue and started driving to the hospital. To all the people concerned it was a scam, I did phone the front desk of the hospital and check that there was a dedicated clinic and that I had an appointment there. It took a good 45 minutes to get there and park up and that entire time I’ll admit, I had a sad playlist I made on and tried to sift through my feelings (unsuccessfully). 

It was a hospital I’d never been to and I was (apparently) visibly anxious about where to go because someone on the door that was directing people came over and asked me if I was okay. I very awkwardly explained to the 6’2 bald bouncer looking sweetheart that I was there for a sexual health check and he directed me to reception where between the social distancing guidelines and the slightly hearing impaired receptionist meant I had to basically yell that I needed directions to the sexual health clinic. 

I’ll spare you the angst I felt waiting around but I got into a room with a nurse who explained that they would do a rapid test first then a full test if that came back positive because it had been over 8 week since the exposure. I got the finger prick but because my hands were so cold she had to prick a second finger. We made some small talk while she sent the test away. She was so understanding and the perfect balance of professional and caring.

Then another nurse came into the room and asked to speak with Denise (the lady with me). When she came back in I already knew. But hearing the words drove it home.

“The rapid test came back positive”

Anything past that was completely drowned out. My blood froze in my veins. I just sat there. She was incredibly comforting, talked me through the stats on false positives and explained that if I it was true it wasn’t the end of my life. That after a little while it wouldn’t even be a blip on my radar. She asked if I wanted a full STD panel as well, this was after a good amount of me sat in stunned silence just absorbing. I just went along with it. There was a different nurse that offered me something to eat or drink. Then another one that explained how I would do the swabs and urine samples. Then another one to take the blood sample. The another one asking if I wanted information on Hep A/B vaccines or HPV. Then another one... the whirlwind just continued. 

Every single person I dealt with was the epitome of what makes a good healthcare professional. 

I was offered literature, websites, numbers to call, people to reach out to.

The drive home I couldn’t bear to have anything but the silence and gravity of the situation to keep me company. The nurses advised at least including someone at my home in on the situation for support but I couldn’t even begin to articulate how any of this came to pass. Honestly I couldn’t even explain it to myself. People say don’t beat yourself up but while I resented the person that gave it to me (I spoke to him and I wish I hadn’t.), I knew that I played a major part, made a stupid mistake and now I was paying the hefty price. 

Honestly my memory of the evening is patchy. I felt as if I was watching my life through a one way mirror unable to interact. I felt shallow having bullshit conversations about what to have for tea or what to do with the lovely weather that was coming tomorrow. I kept the facade in place, probably more to keep myself together in honesty. I played some games online with my friends. More existing than partaking. I just kept telling myself. You have HIV. You have HIV. You have HI... I wrote out a list of my biggest fears and then things that could help calm them alongside that. 

I went to sleep. Truthfully I didn’t lie awake worrying. I think my body needed time to shut down and escape. That brings us to today. I dragged myself out of bed. Ran through the entire previous day. Start to finish. Down to the colour of the pins the nurses wore. Every step of the way hoping that the illusion would shatter and I’d be able to point to the piece that made this an elaborate nightmare instead of truth. I thought about bailing on work. I thought about bailing on my life and just leaving in my car. My perspective had shifted so dramatically so quickly. But I logged into my work computer, joined the calls I was meant to. Was a good employee. I made meaningless small talk with people I couldn’t decide if I liked or hated.

A call from ‘Unknown Number’ dragged me closer back to present. I answered it. My voice betraying me and tightening. 

The first words out of her mouth was something I fully expected to hear 

“I’m sorry” 

What followed however will stay with me as long as I live.

“The rapid test was incorrect. We’ve run your blood and the test is negative. You do not have HIV” 

That was the first time during all this that I actually cried. The lurching from one extreme to the other had finally cracked me. They told me that it would be possibly another two weeks before the full panel came back. She could’ve told me the winning lottery numbers and it wouldn’t have even registered.

So here we are. I’m HIV negative. In theory, nothing in my life has changed. Realistically my outlook will never be the same. 

It may seem stupid but I got a random number generator up (1 to 70, same odds I had), picked a completely meaningless number and pressed generate again and again and again. I never actually hit on the number I chose.

I’m sure at some point I’ll be able to even stomach the idea of sex and when that day comes there will be some many precautions I’ll look like a knight in chain mail armour. The lessons I’ve learned are seared into my brain and honestly I hope it stays that way. The rollercoaster I’ve felt is one I hope never to ride again. Despite all this, even at my absolute lowest; the stories I heard from people on here, the love and support from the community have given me my faith that had the odds gone the other way I could’ve made it through. Not immediately, but with time.

I know this is excessively long and yet I feel I’ve missed out so much information and feelings. But I wanted to have a document of how I felt. How every heartbeat seemed to last forever. So that if I ever feel the need to ‘risk it’ or get lost in the heat of the moment all I have to do is read this post. I will try to respond to all the PM’s but right now I’m going to enjoy every god damn breath. It’s cliche, oversaid and complete tripe but everything seems brighter and more real again. A massive props to anyone that made it this far, god knows how. I know I’m just a meaningless 19 year old on the internet but I hope this post gives so insight to the process both mentally and in terms of what actually happens.

All I have to remember this by is the two pricks on my finger, the needle mark on my arm, the uncertainty I felt, and these posts. But that’s more than enough.

TL;DR:

Rapid test came back positive. 
Evaluated my entire life.
Full test came back negative.

I'm not usually in to hook ups... have only done anything with 5 or 6 guys, but a couple months ago (few weeks before lockdown) I met up with a dude from Grindr.

About 20 minutes in he said ""you know I'm poz, right?"", which kind of surprised me -- to be fair, it was listed as one of his Tribes or whatever, but I guess I didn't notice until afterwards. 

He said he's non-viral/has been taking treatments for a while -- seemed like a trustworthy guy, but I know I shouldn't just take his word on it.

He didn't end up cumming and eventually just left, but I gave him unprotected oral for at least 30 minutes (ass included). He also tried topping me (with a condom) for about 10 minutes before we gave up since it wasn't gonna work.

I've done some reading and it seems like transmission rates are super low, but I've had super swollen lymph glands in my neck/armpits for about a month now, which seems to be the most common symptom. Have also been super sore in general, but that's probably due to being cooped up.

Now isn't really the best time to go get tested -- not even sure if my GP's office is taking physical appointments yet -- but would it make sense to get tested when possible? Would I be showing more symptoms by now if I had anything?

I do not know the guys status, although if he did have HIV it would be in the acute stages as he was tested in January and was negative (apparently).

I had been taking Prep for 30 days from the 14th of March till the 14th of April, however, I then missed doses. The next dose I took was on the 18th of April. So 3-4 days of missed doses 😔 I then took prep for 3 days after the exposure ( I didn’t realise that I was supposed to continue for 28 days). 

I guess my question is - will the 30 days of constant prep with no missed doses still have afforded me protection for the sexual incident despite missing 3 pills prior to it occurring? And is 3 days of prep after the oral intercourse sufficient? I’ve read that 2 days can be enough? 
I then must have missed 5 or 6 days and then continued taking the rest of my prep until finishing the bottle on the 14th may. 

I appreciate that oral transmission is very low, but it I still possible. 
Since the incident I’ve had a sore throat, multiple occasions of night sweats, swollen lymph nodes in my armpit, pain in my groin. a rash on my stomach that resolved after a few days, and most recently a series of 7 boils that appears on my lower leg. 

I took an at home test kit (3rd generation) on the 17th May (one month after exposure) which returned a negative result - is that reliable? Or does prep affect the results.

I was wondering, since I know there is prevention medicine for HIV, how long you can live if you catch HIV early nowadays.

Can you live to a normal live expectancy (if you stay healthy)?

Any information concerning what scientists are doing to research and prevent HIV/AIDS?

(A very specific question) What field of science do people go into to help research and prevent/cure HIV?

The last question I’m not expecting anyone to know it’s just there because I’m doing Chemistry and Biology I’m school and if I could help the fight against HIV/AIDS through work in later life I would be immensely proud and happy to dedicate work to it.

I don't want to sound dumb because of course you could catch STDs when you have unprotected sex and etc. but as I think about it, it makes sense since uncut dicks still has a foreskin (which is ""closed"") and it could get whatever microscopic to stay there longer than when you're cut.

I started dating him and everything was amazing, all that lovey dovey things, the i miss you and wanna see you etc.. two weeks in and his test came up positive and directly started taking his medicine ( we haven'thad sex as he had doubts about his status). Ever since then, he started getting moody which is understandable, but he also became less and less affectionate,  like barely kissing me, barely flirting, all that wanna see you and miss you and wanna hug you went away. So could that be a side effect of all of this? I don't wanna bring it up as the whole HIV topic is still sensitive to him and I'm lost as I don't know if he doesn't like me the same anymore or if it is just a side effect"

I downloaded Grindr for the first time this semester and got especially carried away this past month - I almost always play safe, but I slipped up a few times after I went on Grindr tipsy. I'm really stressing out about all the dumb decisions I made earlier this month and figured I'd ask for advice/help/guidance here.

I'm super worried about three hookups that all happened about a week or two ago:

1) I hooked up with another guy at my school. All we did was make out and swap head, and I swallowed after he said he was neg. I guess I thought because he was also a college student at a fairly competitive school, the odds of him having HIV were low? There's definitely a lot flawed with that logic but that was what went through my head at the time.

For the second guy, I bottomed - during the hookup the condom broke, but he didn't cum, and he said he was neg and on PReP, and just been tested earlier this month.

The third hookup, I bottomed again, but this time with no condom - the hookup was happening really fast. While he was topping me, I started getting really paranoid so I stopped it and left, and he didn't cum.

It's been two weeks since all of that, and I've felt a few very very light aches in my arms (which could just be because I sleep in weird positions sometimes?), my forehead has been a little warm the past couple days, and I've been a little lightheaded on and off. I'm really stressing over if this is just my persistent cold I've had all semester or early HIV symptoms or coronavirus incubating - I don't know. I'm freaking out a lot, and if I test positive I'm afraid it'll ruin career opportunities for me in the future. Help? Advice? What's the earliest I can use a home test and have it be accurate, and where can I get home test kits?"

I’m studying to be a doctor myself and I know his chances are good since he contracted it very recently. There are so many people out there who are HIV+ but they’re living normal lives, setting and meeting goals and spending time with their loved ones. I told him to not panic, just focus on himself and not to focus on how much time he has left but I can’t help myself from overthinking and being so mad at him. 

I have no idea how well our country is at handling HIV+ patients. It’s not a new illness like COVID 19 so I’m pretty sure they’ve gotten cases before but the stigma around the disease is so prevalent and I’m so scared for him. I can’t even go and meet him because our city has imposed a lockdown and I’ve got no reason to step out to excuse myself from my family."

On 2/28 I had my regular 3 month check up. My results came back reactive for the 4th gen and then neg for antibodies for HIV 1/2 and negative for RNA. Still uneasy with the result I asked my doctor to have a second test done. 

On 3/9 I got re tested with the same result reactive for 4th gen and then negative for antibodies and negative for RNA. My doctor said he felt even more comfortable with my negative diagnosis. 

Ever since, I’ve been taking PreP as prescribed, not engaging in any sex (the quarantine helps) and doing a bunch of research. Seems like I’m in the clear but the reactive results in the 4th gen tests puzzle me. According to what I’ve read false positives can be due to other autoimmune diseases something as simple as celiac desease or as severe as cancer. Also the fact that I’m on PrEP might affect the results.

I asked my doctor and he said he’s not sure why the reactive results. Have any of you had any experience with this reactive results? I’m due for another check up on May but I’m just wondering.

So I was on tinder and matched with a guy that actually responded back and we have been talking ever sense. That’s about all we can do since we are quarantined. Plus he works in healthcare so is ever more important now to keep the distance. 

So a little back story, when I got HIV, it was another time. Literally, not to many people know of my hiv status and I keep everyone at a distance. I don’t really don’t have close friends. That’s mainly cause of my ex. It’s been one big secret so when it comes to dating it scares the ever living shit out of me. 

So we have a lot of similarities and we talked about meeting when all of this is over. Well today he said he want to cut ties. Which I found off, since we haven’t met or even dated. To be honest the more I chat and talk with him, I actually starting to like him. 

One thing with me, I rather prefer an honest answer then a sugar coated one. So I ask him, what’s up, Im a big boy and I need to know why. I won’t get mad, I just need to know the reason why to have closure. 

He pretty much said he is liking me more and more that we talk but he’s scared because he is HIV POSITIVE. I came clean and told him I was undetectable also and not to shut me out. 

So where do I go for here. If it doesn’t work is it still hard to date with HIV as it was 16 yr ago. Any thoughts and advice would be helpful cause I know how this guy is feeling. I’m scared shitless also. Will a 16 yr abusive relationship all that I will have the rest of my life."

He always seems to be sick with colds, routinely has mouth ulcers, and recently has developed some psoriasis.

Needed a place to express what i’m feeling.

I am 17 and a senior in high school, late February of this year some college kids from a state university were throwing a bonfire at the beach. My friends convinced me to go and off we went . I wasn’t good emotionally due to family problems so I tried to drown it all away with the help of alcohol ( extremely stupid on my part I know). As the night went on I met this guy from the college, we began to make out and things escalated. I was so out of my senses I could hardly walk, causing me to fall and trip over countless times. You could probably guess what happens next, I tried to fight him off but I had no strength, all he would say to me is  “It’s okay i’m clean”
  
 All I could remember is him only inserting his tip and pulling out afterwards. Few days later I experienced a really bad sore throat, ear pain, and mild fever. I didn’t think much of it and just thought it was an ear infection. I tried my best to forget about the events, but this past week i’ve been nothing but a paranoid mess. I’ve searched up symptoms and they matched the ones I had. I saw a CDC document that confirms there is only a 1.48% to contract HIV through bottoming, but this didn’t my mind to ease. I’m going to my Dr next Monday  and i will be asking for a test. I really have no one to blame but myself. I have done something so stupid and i’ll never be able to take it back. I still have a sense of hope that everything will be fine, but my anxiety takes over. I never thought I would be in this situation and that my first time would go like this.

I had protected with and I was the top. We did blowjobs (no cum) and rimming. The person claims is clean. I came in the condom which verified the condom was still good (the person put on the condom).

Day 1: Next day I felt a tingling in my lip and i figured something is for sure wrong

Day 2: Tingling went away but muscles feel tense and hurt and goes away quickly

Went to 3 major hospitals. (2 didn't know what is PEP and the third said only for rape victims)

Day 3: My throat is stiff, doesn't hurt to swallow at all. tiny bit of random chill. sweat more than usual but not too much at night.

Day 4: Throat got a lot stiffer, i checked the glands at a doctor and said they are fine. night sweats happens during my sleep only based on armpit smell. 

Day 5: Throat continued to get even stiffer and now i started to feel weaker and a headaches are taking over. No chills though.

Other symptoms: I lost food appetite, can't get hard

At this point I'm at full panic, doctor said we can't test for HIV yet wait 2 weeks at least, but they took urine sample for common STDs. Those don't feel feel like a flu, Guys I really need your advice here and experience!"

And even before that it was probably late February the last time I had.

But this morning I got a call from an ‘Unknown ID’ caller. Iffy so I just let it go to voicemail. I checked my voicemail and it was a woman asking if I could ring back on a number. I googled the number and nothing came up. I thought it might be a scam but it seemed pretty elaborate so I chanced it and rang back.

The lady that answered the phone seemed so so nice, like a comforting Aunty. She said that they would like to schedule me in for a Sexual Wellness Test. I was a bit shocked to say the least, I’ve had one boyfriend of 6 months and have slept with 3 people in total so I don’t exactly get around a lot. 

Then she said possibly the worst thing I could’ve heard. The sexual illness that you’ve come into contact with is HIV. I nearly passed out. Today I’d started a new project at my work, was planning on relaxing and studying for an exam this evening. Life was pretty good. 

Instead I’m imagining the worst possible news again and again. I know the only person I could’ve got it from. It was the first time I’d ever bottomed. I asked to use a condom but they just brushed it off. I feel like such a fucking idiot, it’s completely my fault if the news is bad.

I know it’s not the end of the world. But at 19 it sure as shit feels like the end of my world. So now I’m just sat. Shell shocked. The pizza I was planning to have for lunch is burnt and cold and I’m trying to come up with a reason to tell my parents why I need to leave for a few hours in the middle of a pandemic. 

I’m sure what I want from this post. I just wanted to put it words and process my how I’m feeling. I’ve got so much anger at the person that could’ve possibly given it to me.

TL; DR, at the bottom.

First off I’d like to thank each and every person that reached out via PM or left a supportive comment. I’m still reading them and will try to respond to as many as I humanly can.

The last 48 have been possibly the most tumultuous and stressful of my life. In all honesty I spent most of the day after I found out in a zombie eque state. I didn’t have anybody in real life I wanted to talk through it with but there was some solid advice given in the comments that I really took to heart.

So yesterday morning I made some excuses about needing a blood test for an unrelated issue and started driving to the hospital. To all the people concerned it was a scam, I did phone the front desk of the hospital and check that there was a dedicated clinic and that I had an appointment there. It took a good 45 minutes to get there and park up and that entire time I’ll admit, I had a sad playlist I made on and tried to sift through my feelings (unsuccessfully). 

It was a hospital I’d never been to and I was (apparently) visibly anxious about where to go because someone on the door that was directing people came over and asked me if I was okay. I very awkwardly explained to the 6’2 bald bouncer looking sweetheart that I was there for a sexual health check and he directed me to reception where between the social distancing guidelines and the slightly hearing impaired receptionist meant I had to basically yell that I needed directions to the sexual health clinic. 

I’ll spare you the angst I felt waiting around but I got into a room with a nurse who explained that they would do a rapid test first then a full test if that came back positive because it had been over 8 week since the exposure. I got the finger prick but because my hands were so cold she had to prick a second finger. We made some small talk while she sent the test away. She was so understanding and the perfect balance of professional and caring.

Then another nurse came into the room and asked to speak with Denise (the lady with me). When she came back in I already knew. But hearing the words drove it home.

“The rapid test came back positive”

Anything past that was completely drowned out. My blood froze in my veins. I just sat there. She was incredibly comforting, talked me through the stats on false positives and explained that if I it was true it wasn’t the end of my life. That after a little while it wouldn’t even be a blip on my radar. She asked if I wanted a full STD panel as well, this was after a good amount of me sat in stunned silence just absorbing. I just went along with it. There was a different nurse that offered me something to eat or drink. Then another one that explained how I would do the swabs and urine samples. Then another one to take the blood sample. The another one asking if I wanted information on Hep A/B vaccines or HPV. Then another one... the whirlwind just continued. 

Every single person I dealt with was the epitome of what makes a good healthcare professional. 

I was offered literature, websites, numbers to call, people to reach out to.

The drive home I couldn’t bear to have anything but the silence and gravity of the situation to keep me company. The nurses advised at least including someone at my home in on the situation for support but I couldn’t even begin to articulate how any of this came to pass. Honestly I couldn’t even explain it to myself. People say don’t beat yourself up but while I resented the person that gave it to me (I spoke to him and I wish I hadn’t.), I knew that I played a major part, made a stupid mistake and now I was paying the hefty price. 

Honestly my memory of the evening is patchy. I felt as if I was watching my life through a one way mirror unable to interact. I felt shallow having bullshit conversations about what to have for tea or what to do with the lovely weather that was coming tomorrow. I kept the facade in place, probably more to keep myself together in honesty. I played some games online with my friends. More existing than partaking. I just kept telling myself. You have HIV. You have HIV. You have HI... I wrote out a list of my biggest fears and then things that could help calm them alongside that. 

I went to sleep. Truthfully I didn’t lie awake worrying. I think my body needed time to shut down and escape. That brings us to today. I dragged myself out of bed. Ran through the entire previous day. Start to finish. Down to the colour of the pins the nurses wore. Every step of the way hoping that the illusion would shatter and I’d be able to point to the piece that made this an elaborate nightmare instead of truth. I thought about bailing on work. I thought about bailing on my life and just leaving in my car. My perspective had shifted so dramatically so quickly. But I logged into my work computer, joined the calls I was meant to. Was a good employee. I made meaningless small talk with people I couldn’t decide if I liked or hated.

A call from ‘Unknown Number’ dragged me closer back to present. I answered it. My voice betraying me and tightening. 

The first words out of her mouth was something I fully expected to hear 

“I’m sorry” 

What followed however will stay with me as long as I live.

“The rapid test was incorrect. We’ve run your blood and the test is negative. You do not have HIV” 

That was the first time during all this that I actually cried. The lurching from one extreme to the other had finally cracked me. They told me that it would be possibly another two weeks before the full panel came back. She could’ve told me the winning lottery numbers and it wouldn’t have even registered.

So here we are. I’m HIV negative. In theory, nothing in my life has changed. Realistically my outlook will never be the same. 

It may seem stupid but I got a random number generator up (1 to 70, same odds I had), picked a completely meaningless number and pressed generate again and again and again. I never actually hit on the number I chose.

I’m sure at some point I’ll be able to even stomach the idea of sex and when that day comes there will be some many precautions I’ll look like a knight in chain mail armour. The lessons I’ve learned are seared into my brain and honestly I hope it stays that way. The rollercoaster I’ve felt is one I hope never to ride again. Despite all this, even at my absolute lowest; the stories I heard from people on here, the love and support from the community have given me my faith that had the odds gone the other way I could’ve made it through. Not immediately, but with time.

I know this is excessively long and yet I feel I’ve missed out so much information and feelings. But I wanted to have a document of how I felt. How every heartbeat seemed to last forever. So that if I ever feel the need to ‘risk it’ or get lost in the heat of the moment all I have to do is read this post. I will try to respond to all the PM’s but right now I’m going to enjoy every god damn breath. It’s cliche, oversaid and complete tripe but everything seems brighter and more real again. A massive props to anyone that made it this far, god knows how. I know I’m just a meaningless 19 year old on the internet but I hope this post gives so insight to the process both mentally and in terms of what actually happens.

All I have to remember this by is the two pricks on my finger, the needle mark on my arm, the uncertainty I felt, and these posts. But that’s more than enough.

TL;DR:

Rapid test came back positive. 
Evaluated my entire life.
Full test came back negative. 
My evaluation stands.
I would say it’s worth a read to get the full context"

I'm not usually in to hook ups... have only done anything with 5 or 6 guys, but a couple months ago (few weeks before lockdown) I met up with a dude from Grindr.

About 20 minutes in he said ""you know I'm poz, right?"", which kind of surprised me -- to be fair, it was listed as one of his Tribes or whatever, but I guess I didn't notice until afterwards. 

He said he's non-viral/has been taking treatments for a while -- seemed like a trustworthy guy, but I know I shouldn't just take his word on it.

He didn't end up cumming and eventually just left, but I gave him unprotected oral for at least 30 minutes (ass included). He also tried topping me (with a condom) for about 10 minutes before we gave up since it wasn't gonna work.

I've done some reading and it seems like transmission rates are super low, but I've had super swollen lymph glands in my neck/armpits for about a month now, which seems to be the most common symptom. Have also been super sore in general, but that's probably due to being cooped up.

Now isn't really the best time to go get tested -- not even sure if my GP's office is taking physical appointments yet -- but would it make sense to get tested when possible? Would I be showing more symptoms by now if I had anything?

I do not know the guys status, although if he did have HIV it would be in the acute stages as he was tested in January and was negative (apparently).

I had been taking Prep for 30 days from the 14th of March till the 14th of April, however, I then missed doses. The next dose I took was on the 18th of April. So 3-4 days of missed doses 😔 I then took prep for 3 days after the exposure ( I didn’t realise that I was supposed to continue for 28 days). 

I guess my question is - will the 30 days of constant prep with no missed doses still have afforded me protection for the sexual incident despite missing 3 pills prior to it occurring? And is 3 days of prep after the oral intercourse sufficient? I’ve read that 2 days can be enough? 
I then must have missed 5 or 6 days and then continued taking the rest of my prep until finishing the bottle on the 14th may. 

I appreciate that oral transmission is very low, but it I still possible. 
Since the incident I’ve had a sore throat, multiple occasions of night sweats, swollen lymph nodes in my armpit, pain in my groin. a rash on my stomach that resolved after a few days, and most recently a series of 7 boils that appears on my lower leg. 

I took an at home test kit (3rd generation) on the 17th May (one month after exposure) which returned a negative result - is that reliable? Or does prep affect the results.

About 5 months ago I had a risky encounter with a trans escort, incertive anal sex without a condom. 

Last night after weeks of anxiety and feeling that I have some swollen lymph nodes on my neck I went out and bought an Oraquick oral HIV test. I did the test exactly as the instructions described and got a negative test result. 

Initially I was relieved until I read that the test has a 1/10 chance of giving you a false negative result. Now I feel anxious that the test didnt work properly.

I don't know what would cause a false negative nor do I know the likelihood that I got a false negative when you consider how many months its been since the potential exposure. Either way I plan on testing again in 3 months. If anybody here could give me some insight or ease my mind I would appreciate it!! 

Thanks!!"

I kinda brushed it off since he knows his status and is undetectable so he couldn't have transmitted it anyway. I mean it's unlikely he's not taking his meds unless he wants to get AIDs and die so that's a pretty big incentive. I know there's always a risk that somebody's lying, but technically the risk is bigger with someone who doesn't know their status and therefore potentially could have a high virus load due to lack of treatment.

Basically I slept with a guy Friday night and we ended up having anal unprotected sex. He seemed pretty nice and genuine, and he told me he was on Prep and gets tested for STD's every 3 months. He then logged into his lab test website and showed results from March, and everything was negative. There were also other health test results he took that show he's a pretty health-responsible person. There were also creatine or something levels that he said has to get checked because Prep can mess with them. He also took me to his bathroom and opened a drawer to show a huge bag full of used home hiv tests. He seemed pretty good with his health, and said he recently got tested again about the day before we had sex. He said they give results usually within 24 hours, so since I was scared we could wait until the results came back to have anal sex. He really made me feel relieved so I basically said let's do it. I never do unprotected anal with a stranger but things happen, and I caved. Now it's Monday morning and I'm paranoid if I should go to the ER to ask for PEP or something, I'm just really scared.

I was so shocked and he basically tell me not to worry because he is on medication for 6 months now, while he didn’t check for the viral load, he claimed that his cd4 level is already quite high (450) so he assumed that his medication worked and (hopefully) become undetectable. Also he said that all of his exes are fine because he always play it safe (using condom). Fyi, all the sex lasted for around 25-30 minutes, didnt have a rough sex, i used lubricant and the condoms didnt seem to break, i also ejaculated inside the condom (my biggest regret😵)

Although i felt completely fine in the first 2 months, i started to have this weird symptoms after he told me that his cd4 got worsen (around 100) on November because he skipped the medication for 3 days. Later in December, I got a swollen cheek tissue around my lower right wisdom tooth, and a month later i got stomach problems (fatigue/bloating) that persist until now. On around April, i got the same swollen cheek tissue and some ulcers on my lower left wisdom tooth. And just last week i had this itchiness all over my body, especially during the cold nights which i never had before (no visible rash). All these unusual symptoms gave a anxiety, i always googled about hiv everytime i feel there’s something wrong with my body. The symptoms dont appear like the usual 2-3 weeks after infection, but still it freaks me out, because i never had those before, like ever, especially my ongoing stomach problems. I also dont seem to have any fever and just had one mild night sweat. 

I know its easier to just get a test and be done with it, but im super scared if it turns out positive. I wouldnt able to deal with all the medicine and telling my parents would be a nightmare. Any of you guys have experienced hiv anxiety that turned out negative/positive?"

-feb 20th i hooked up with a guy from bumble. we made out a little bit which led to me going down on him. i didn’t swallow or anything and then we started doing anal (he’s a top) he wore a condom and it didn’t break or anything but there was some pain while having sex. he took it off and came on my face. i texted him during all this and he says he hasn’t been tested but has never had sex with another guy.

-march 1st i found another guy on bumble, i blew him for like 30 seconds before penetration with a condom. (he lasted 5 minutes) and came in the condom. he says he has been tested and is terrified of hiv and i was his first guy as well.

-april 9th i hung out with my ex boyfriend and we went to the park and made out and there was some biting but no gaping holes or any bleeding of any sort. hours later we went to his house and i performed oral on him which i swallowed (i regret it now). two days after i swallowed him i got cold sores on my lips and a fever. (i get cold sores sometimes on my lips and so does my mom, i’m guessing i inherited it from her) he also says he has been tested multiple times for hiv and herpes.

I'm here because my best friend, a gay man, on Tuesday received notification from a blood donation center that his blood was reactive to the HIV test. He immediately got retested and is waiting for his results which should come today. I've been talking to him nonstop, doing everything in my power to assure he isn't alone right now. He lives with his parents currently, and his mom is aware of everything that is going on as well. I have a very good relationship with her as well as him, and both of us are doing everything we can in our power to help him. 

The issue is that he has been in hospitalized for suicide and psychotic depression 3 times in the past already, and has explicitly told me that even if I try and get him institutionalized, he's already been through it, knows exactly what to say to get out of the hospitals, and it will only waste resources and prolong the inevitable. That he will kill himself, no matter what. 

This all stems from him being rejected by the gay community through his life, due to being a bit overweight and also probably from being a bit eccentric. What he always says is that romance is a basic human need that he has been deprived of for too long, and that he can't bear the pain of living life as long as he is still deprived of it. That the HIV+ status will be the final nail in the coffin for him and that he already feels he has so little chance of ever finding love that this feels insurmountable. I feel like I've tried everything I could in the past 5 years of our friendship to give him a new perspective and to help him and nothing I say or do matters at this point. I can't seem to make him see his own value, and it's killing me to know that he doesn't have any hope left. I know this is a lot, and I'm basically out of options but I just decided to throw this out there in the chances that anyone might have a deeper insight on this process and anything I could do still to help him.

Taking advantage of a young guy putting his health at risk is awful, but the guy was ugly af, smelly, desperate and I was nice enough to blow him and spend 15 minutes with him (he was disgusting).

I am 24 years old, and a top. I was in a relationship about a year ago, in which I had sex 3 times with no condom. (more times with condom, of course). I trusted him, and he told me his testing was up to date. Since then, our relationship has fallen apart, and I have learned second hand of some undesirable characteristics of him that I was kept from before. It turns out he is a drug user, and is not shy about having unprotected sex with multiple guys. (he's always the bottom). And now, I am being a hypochondriac. 

I have always believed that HIV is transmitted quite easily through unprotected sex. But I've seen many articles citing studies that it's actually very difficult to transmit, and if you put a number on the risk, it would amount to much less than 1% per exposure, especially for the insertive partner.  

I am aware that certain factors raise the risk, such as recent infection, open sores, viral load, etc. 

I am going to the clinic to be tested when I get home (currently traveling). But, I'm becoming absolutely miserable with worry.  

I have never showed any symptoms of HIV. (And I'm aware not every infection produces symptoms). One time, I thought for sure I had all the symptoms of HIV, so I went to the clinic and tested positive for strep throat instead. In all 3 exposures, I don't recall any blood or open sores, and plenty of lube was used. 

If you don't mind entertaining my thread, I would like to ask what your assessment of my risk would be. I remember seeing another sites statistics, that claimed half of all gay men who are currently college aged will have HIV by the time they are 50. Is there truth to that?  If so, how then could others claim the rate of transmission is so low? Are guys really having bareback sex with so many guys? Or is it just easier than they say to transmit?   


Please forgive my ignorance and annoyance. Since those exposures, I have not had sex without a condom. And I am much less trusting nowadays after that incident. 

Thank you so much for your time."

One day her boyfriend came to visit and they talked about how they do anal sometimes but always with a condom because they don't want to get AIDS. I asked her, if her and her bf were monogamous and tested negative, then why would she think she'd catch HIV/AIDS from doing anal? 

Her answer was: ""don't the juices from the penis and the anus mix together and create AIDS?"""

I'm sure it's nothing since this was oral sex, with 5-6 days of prep prior, and a self-reporting HIV negative person, so the odds should favour me NOT getting infected, but I'm still curious. Is it possible for the virus to replicate and cause symptoms in just 4-5 days? Given that this was oral, if actual viral load/intake affects the severity of the initial symptoms (like how apparently a bigger viral load of coronavirus makes your symptoms worse), surely my viral intake would have been lower than if this was bareback anal.

Side question but also would you say 4 weeks is enough time to leave before taking a test? I've ordered a test kit and was going to wait 4 weeks to try it (it also tests for chlamydia and other STDs but they're not my main concern rn), since they say 4-6 weeks post-exposure is when you'd be likely to get a good result."

I'm really not one to post, but I just wanted some advice from the community on how to progress forward with my life. 

I've only recently gotten into the gay scene, and I hooked up with a guy from Grindr. Honestly I didn't know much about STIs at all, and the whole excitement overtook me and we ended up having a lot of sex, all BB. A few days later I came down with a really bad fever, sore throat, night sweats, raised glands, effectively every symptom of acute hiv infection apart from a rash. This prompted me to ask the guy I hooked up with to get a 4th Gen HIV test. It came back positive. Now at this point I was distraught. I know HIV isn't as bad as it used to be, but I guess I was overcome by emotion.Due to it being a Saturday, he was asked to come in on Monday to confirmation, so I was left assuming I were positive for the weekend.

Long story short, it was a false positive, and later down the line I've had many many many tests, all negative (latest being 8 weeks post sex). From this I like to think I've learnt, I'm on the prep scheme, and I'll always use protection from here on in. But I have a really bad issue with constant testing, I'll still order HIV tests thinking I'm positive from any small sign of illness, or feeling. Furthermore I've developed some really awful trust issue as the guy who I slept with has been a compulsive liar about who he's slept with, if he used protection, a lot about his sexual life. Perhaps because he says how much he cares about me and how he would want a relationship and more sex. Although, I've told him I'm not having sex until I'm over this hurdle.

How would you advice I go forward from stopping this weekly compulsive testing, and what I would assume anexity driven symptoms (such as numbness or mucus). As well as if my trust issues are founded or not. From what I can tell the guy does genuinely care about me for more then just sex.

I know a lot of this must sound pedantic, but for me it's very real and would appreciate the advice! 

Cheers for reading guys!

**Please get on PrEP to prevent HIV transmission in our community.**

I've recently learned a lot about HIV. Things I wish I would've been taught by a Gay big bro, by my Doctor, or by a sex ed class. Things I strongly encourage you to learn, like, for example, that a positive top is 10x more likely to pass HIV to a negative bottom than a positive bottom is to pass HIV to a negative top, or that HIV transmission from oral is extremely unlikely, and more. Another thing I've learned is that a man on PrEP is taking care of himself and his partners, a lot like how a mask-wearer is preventing CoViD-19.

**Here are 14 reasons I could think of that you should be on PrEP, or Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis, to help prevent the spread of HIV among our community.**

\+++

# 1 PrEP is nearly 100% effective in preventing HIV infection following exposure

While there are some (3 or so documented) possible cases of men getting HIV after starting PrEP, overall, men who take PrEP and avoid taking injectable drugs while sharing needles are almost guaranteed to not contract HIV when exposed if they are consistent with PrEP.

# 2 It can be cheap or free.

USA here. Our healthcare system sucks. That said, for most people on conventional insurance, PrEP is discounted with insurance enough that a ""co-pay card"" from its maker Gilead will make it free. In most socialized healthcare countries, PrEP is the cost of a lunch per month. Summer 2021 should see a generic option for Truvada as well, which will be much more affordable for the uninsured. Finally, many local HIV prevention organizations will help LGTBQ men pay for PrEP.

# 3 It helps stop the spread of other STIs too*

Doctors who will monitor your PrEP regimine generally use your PrEP checkups to also monitor you for other common STDs/STIs and your overall sexual health. This means that they'll catch other things before you spread them--especially since some STDs/STIs can be asymptomatic.

*Huge disclaimer: PrEP itself doesn't prevent other STDs/STIs, only HIV, but your Doctor's management of your sexual health will.*

# 4 HIV takes a while to show itself on lab tests; doesn't mean a negative test means the person is negative

HIV doesn't immediately show up in lab tests after an exposure. In fact, it can take between 2 and 12 weeks and up to six months! Depending on the time between an exposure and a recent HIV test, someone could get a negative result and a few weeks later the infection takes hold with the person thinking they are negative until thier next test.

# 5 ""Clean"" or ""Disease Free"" and other Self-reported status is really meaningless.

The idea of choosing your partners based on their status is referred to as ""serosorting."" Serosorting fails when someone claiming to be of a certain status is not. Relying on another's self-reported status is unreliable at best.

A person tested 3 months ago with no recent sexual partners is minimal risk. Meanwhile, a person tested on the same day but with one recent sexual partner has some risk. And a third person tested on the same day but who has had 30 sexual partners is a much greater risk. All will self-report that they are ""clean, last tested 3 months ago."" Combined with the point about HIV's delayed infection following exposure, who knows if anyone is really ever ""clean""?

Merely asking a potential partner if they are ""clean"" is useless in determining your risk with them.

# 6 You can get HIV the first time you have sex.

My boyfriend--the catalyst for my self-education into HIV in fact--was diagnosed with HIV. He had penetrative sex (anal sex) with three men, his first with whom he did not use a condom, his second with whom he did, and me. Since I don't have HIV, he strongly believes his first time having sex was the day he got HIV.

# 7 Condoms work. Period. Until that one time they don't

Condoms work. You should use them. PrEP does not prevent other STDs/STIs, but condoms do. Yet sometimes condoms fail. They sometimes break, especially if they are older; and people who are not regularly having sex and/or are recently out of a relationship may be more likely to use an expired condom. Also, some condoms are too small for bigger guys and some condoms are too big for smaller guys and condom effectiveness requires the right sized condom. These are reasons condoms can fail.

# 8 ""In the Moment"" we make bad choices

So what if them condom fails or is too tight? You're in the heat of the moment. ""Just finish."" This is the second point where serosorting fails, by the way, ""in the heat of the moment.""

Speaking of ""in the heat of the moment,"" sometimes an opportunity arises that you didn't plan for. You're at your friends house party drunk and miles from your condoms and lube and you meet a guy and one things leads to another and you both run off to the garage for a quickie. We are gay men, we are sexual, and sometimes spontaneous stuff wants to happen. PrEP can protect you even in those moments.

And ""in the moment"" applies to monogamous couples too. Hey, we are humans. Especially gay humans! My boyfriend and I have had a moment or two where things went little too far with a friend. It was hot stuff each time, never resulting in penetration, but could've, perhaps. And we aren't unique. You don't plan for it to happen, but in the heat of the moment, it might!

# 9 ""Stealthing"" is a thing.

""Stealthing"" happens when an insertive partner (top) discreetly removes a condom that the receptive partner (bottom) requested that be worn, especially during a hookup. They may or may not finish inside, finishing on the partner's back, for example, so to hide their misdeeds, but whether they come in or out of their partner, they will still leave behind bodily fluids that could infect their partner, sometimes without the bottom knowing they were just exposed.

# 10 And so is rape/sexual assault.

While some people consider ""stealthing"" to be a form of rape or sexual assault, there is also more overt rape or sexual assault that PrEP can at least protect you from an HIV transmission from. Whether it be a date rape, or a violent rape, or a partner not respecting the limits of their bottom, it happens. And if it's happening, it's unlikely that a condom will be worn or that both parties check each other's status before it starts.

# 11 Cheating happens in monogamous relationships.

When I first learned my boyfriend had HIV, I suspected he cheated--I now believe he didn't. We do, however, have friends who got HIV from monogamous partners. On a totally different note, my Mom was given herpes from my cheating Father (a fact I wish I didn't know). This can and does happen.  And I'm not just referring to your partner cheating on you, but also you cheating on your partner. You trust each other with your hearts, but mistakes happen. Protect yourself (and protect them) at least from a lifelong infection of HIV.

# 12 It takes a while to start PrEP, and longer to begin being protected by it

You shouldn't wait until you need it, because by then it will be too late. Getting PrEP isn't as easy as going to your drug store.

First you need to get an appointment with a PrEP-friendly Doctor. My main Doctor doesn't want to manage it because he isn't knowledgeable in it, so I see a different doctor for my sexual health. This can take a few days to a few weeks to get an appointment. Then most doctors will require you complete STD/STI testing before you start PrEP. This can take another week. Many USA insurance policies may require you get special clearance to take PrEP, which can cause another days to weeks delay. Then, once you finally have PrEP, you need to take it daily for seven days to have the shield against HIV be fully deployed in your body.

When I was coming out, I did it pretty quickly. I went from ""I'm going to go into this gay chat room"" to making out, dicks out, in my truck with a guy in six days. It takes more than six days to start PrEP. So even if you are not sexually active right now because of the Pandemic or because you aren't dating or whatever, now is the best time to start PrEP, so that when the moment comes, you can enjoy it!

# 13 HIV+ Stigma is Real--and stupid--but real

I'll be honest with you all, knowing what I know now, if I had the option to have sex with a Undetectable HIV+ (U=U) person over a ""clean"" person, I'd take the U=U person in a heartbeat! I trust they are taking care of themselves far more than I trust a ""clean"" person is, because its life and death for a positive person!

But most people still hold the HIV stigma. They assume the positive person got it because they were generally irresponsible, or a slut, or a whore. Yet, in fact, a lot of people get it because someone they trusted didn't know they had it, or because someone lied to them, or because one ""in the heat of moment"" moment turned out to be the wrong time to take a risk.

You don't want the stigma to dog your sex life. On the flip side, be part of the solution to the stigma, please!

# 14 You're Looking Out for Our LGTBQ future by taking PrEP

Finally, just like we are wearing masks to look out for others, taking PrEP is looking out for our community. Transmission is higher now than it has been since the 1980's and its because we both have let our guard down and because we aren't teaching our LGTBQ youth how to truly protect themselves from it while also letting our media, especially gay porn, go back to glorifying bare sex. Take PrEP today to prevent the need for it tomorrow.

# Notes:

* I am not a doctor. Just an average gay bro.
* This is my throwaway because I don't want to broadcast my bf's or my mom's business.
* My partner and I are still together, and in fact, since the third month after his diagnosis are better than ever. He is now undetectable.
* For PrEP, I took Truvada from October until this month, and started Descovy this month.
* Gilead Sciences, the makers of both PrEP's, are absolutely trash people. They price gouge, they are being sued by the US for anti-competitive practices and for violating patents co-owned by the US Government including on parts of the PrEP formula, and just suck as people. I  do hate that I'm enriching them by getting PrEP, but until an alternate option exists this will have to do!

However, I’ve never heard of accidental HIV transmission while on PrEP. This is surprising to me, as most people I talk to on grindr and people online tend to be dismissive when it comes to other infections and diseases, and will just bareback while on PrEP.

In September of 2018 I had this hook up with a random guy on Grindr. We met at his place and then we fucked. Without. Condom. I know it was stupid and irresponsible, but at the moment I didn’t care cause I wasn't on my best and I felt so numb about everything. Even tho he was superkind, and cause I was young and didn’t have much experience on sex (and he knew it), he was always like “it's okay if you don't want to do it” and when I got nervous and started shaking cz I was literally a virgin, he told me that everything was going to be fine and blah blah blah. He did cum inside of me, and then I knew I fucked up and realized I forgot to ask him to put protection. He knew I was a virgen and maybe that’s why he didn’t put any condom???? But anyway, when I got home I immediately freaked out cause of the risks of getting HIV. I asked him (several times) after and he told me that he was clear and that he tested regularly. I wasn’t 100% sure but I was too scared of reaching help so I decided to believe him. I

After that we texted each other sometimes, he was so nice and seemed like he was telling the truth. In one of this conversations he told Ithat he was clear and he got tested and that I should get tested too cause he didn’t believe that I didn’t have any other encounters with other people (even tho I didn’t) This year (in January or February I don’t remember) we hooked up again (this time with a condom, I’m not that dumb). I asked him again if he was clear and he told me that he was and that I shouldn’t worry.

I’ve never experienced any symptoms but I know that there’s people that are asymptomatic. I’m too afraid of telling my mother about this and I tried to call the only medical center that has the quick test but no one ever answers me. 


I always freak out about the possibility of having HIV (cause I’m too anxious on every aspect of my life) and then totally forget about it for months and the freak out again, and when I actually have the balls to get tested, there’s any possibility because of corona. 

For a anxious and depressed person like me this is shit. Please use a condom."

After a breakup with an ex in Oct 2018, I received a false positive result for HIV, leading to doing a second controlled test which returned a negative - it was explained this can sometimes happen

I then got a follow-up test in March 2019 after meeting my current partner and it again returned false positives for HIV and a comment was made that some people can just return these

The phone call today made me think of this as the nurse I spoke to hadn’t heard of this before being a regular thing, and after a bit of a Google (I know, I’m sorry!) this isn’t a typical continued thing unless someone has an autoimmune disease like lupus

Does anyone have any more information on this? I wouldn’t be distraught if it did turn out to be HIV and perhaps the second tests were false negatives, but is there anything else in a persons body that could possibly return constant false positives?

I will query this more at my actual screening next Friday obviously but wondered in the meantime if anyone had some knowledge :)"

I went in for blood draws for non-STD testing reasons, but part of the screening included an HIV test (paid clinical trial). The center called me this morning to inform me that I had tested positive...

We are dealing with an adjustment we had never planned for, but mostly we are dealing with confusion. My husband is the most loyal person I know, and I cannot imagine he has cheated and he has assured me he hasn’t, and I have not either. We’re trying to just move forward with not knowing, and I’m doing ok with it, but he is having a hard time letting go of being unsure where it came from.

Some possible scenarios: - I was active with multiple partners before we met. It is possible/likely, I had partners right up before meeting which means I was tested less than 6 months after other activity. I usually wore condoms, but I have been known to get caught up in the mood and forgo a condom - I was in grad school when we met in a sciences research lab. There were occasional glass breaks and I do recall one time a colleague cut themself quite badly. I probably helped clean them up/care for them without gloves because we didn’t really have training and I just acted. - Other cuts/accidents in lab that I’ve forgotten about that might have exposed me.

We cannot recall anything recent, particularly with covid keeping us home. So I’m left to worry that I may have had this working through me for almost 6 years now without any symptoms.

We are obviously moving quickly on getting an appointment with a specialist, and learning more about where my health is at right now, but just hoping to hear any thoughts on the likely scenarios above or other possibilities. Until someone tells me otherwise, my impression is that we will be able to continue a long happy life together, so in that regard I am doing ok with the news. It has just been an unexpected shock."

HSV infections are a major driver of the HIV epidemic, with over 400,000 new HIV infections each year attributable to genital HSV2. So it’s not easy to say HIV is serious but HSV is negligible. Some of the people who died from AIDS related illnesses only got HIV because of a prior genital HSV2 infection (around 30%).

Basically, the presence of the herpes virus increases the risk of contracting HIV in the event of unprotected sex (since herpes inflames the mucous membranes and makes them more susceptible to exposure to HIV).

That’s not fair are felons above the law like our elitists such as Dr. Fauci and Bill Gates? Was I just a peasant in his eyes ?

Yet I’m on the anti depressants and waiting months for them to work and they don’t do shit. I’m being told I’m depressed by BigPharm WHEN REALLY I AM NOT.

Basically went to meet with someone, topped, had a condom break. I got PEP within 72 hours and anxiety was running high. The whole month went by took my pills every morning and was still afraid of the worst happening even tho all odds and statistics  were really stacked in my favor. In the end, I got tested at 30 days and everything was fine. 

You see a lot of freak out posts here but never the end result. If you think you were exposed from anal sex, go to a doctor and ask about PEP.  I see from some posts that say some doctors dont know what it is, if thats the case go to the Emergency Room but I recommend the clinic before the ER because if youre not literally dying youll probably have to wait. A doctor or clinic can get you in and out faster. Remember you have 72 hours to decide if you want it, if not you may spend the rest of your life wondering what if I had gone and got it, just do it. Also if the worst happens with todays medication, its treatable and your life expectancy doesnt change. 

PEP can cost you thousands without insurance or bad insurance. So get the [Gilead coupon](https://www.gileadadvancingaccess.com/financial-support/) from their website and go to [myviivcard.com](https://myviivcard.com) for the other medicine (I added the links). With both youll likely walk out without having to pay a dime. Sign up before you go to the docotor/ ER or do it in the waiting room and itll save you some time. It takes like 3 minutes to sign up for each program and its worth it.

If you gave/ received oral, stop freaking out unless you literally gave head after walking out of a dentist checkup, or you had oral surgery (root canal, wisdom tooth/teeth) recently. Your risk is low and no doctor will give you PEP. Just get tested around 1-2 weeks for other STIs. If you think youre at risk, check out the CDCs website, it tells you the risk if you had sex with someone that wasnt treated and the transmission rate of that act. It definitely helps put your mind at ease.

Last thing: if you get it theres a couple things to remember. The most important is the time you start it. You have a 72 hour window, some countries say 48, 36 and 24 hours. Look it up if your not sure. Failures are linked to re exposure, that means if you took the time to get it, you should abstain from sex until its done, especially hookups. Other failures are linked to not adhering to dosage, meaning you dont take every pill. Set an alarm, do whatever to make sure that you take each pill because most medical reports show after missing 2 doses its no longer effective. 

I learned my lesson from this and was offered PrEP which I am now on. I just have to do the 3 month follow up. Again, I just wanted to post this for people freaking out over possible exposures. If youre reading this beforehand, get PrEP use condoms be safe and educate yourself.  If youre reading this after unprotected sex, its not the end of the world. Go to a doctor, get PEP and learn from it. PrEP will be affordable after Sept 2020 because Gileads patent is up so generic versions will drive the price to affordable amounts for anyone not on PrEP but wants to go on it.

If I missed anything feel free to comment and add it in. The purpose of this post is just to help anyone in the future."

I'm not out with them. I discovered a few days ago I'm HIV+ and might have been for a while. I was living abroad for a time, I think I got it there.

I'm beginning to accept that. I've already spoken to my doctor, I know it can be treated and I can have a normal life, I have a friend whom I can speak to. I haven't developed any symptoms yet, which is a good sign. I'm contacting people I've hooked up with in the last year to make sure they get tested.

The problem is my parents. I don't know how they might react. Aside from the whole gay son thing (which I think wouldn't be a problem), I've been lying to them for years. I don't know if they suspect something, but I know they see me as a quiet studious responsible guy, definetly not someone who would go around and fuck random people (I don't think they believe I'm still virgin). I don't know how they could react to seeing this image of their son shattered like that, also knowing that he's now there is no going back for him.

Before you say it, I know that HIV now is not the same as 20 years ago, and that with the right treatment I can live normally with no AIDS. I'm gathering information about living with HIV+ people and about therapy so I can ease the process with them, but I'm still freaking out. I'm afraid it might be too much for them. I'm definetly more worried about them than about my future.

LONG STORY: hello, all my life I was practicing super safe sex and test periodically (every 3 months) for hiv and all my tests were negative...3 weeks ago I was having some oral sex with this man when he asked me if he can top me...I agreed..... He brought a ton of lube I almost filled my anus with lube and his penis was completely covered with lube too....after several trials he managed to put it in ( no condoms were available) and because of this much lube I barely felt his dick inside...then exactly after 3 min or even less I told him that I don't like the feeling..so he took it out and cummed on his hands. From this day I call him everyday to ask him if he's clean and he tells me that he's indeed clean but I have trust issues.



After this incident, I wake up every morning to look to my symptoms but actually absolutely no symptoms showed up on me.



So today (after 18 days) I decided to do the PCR or the RNA hiv test and the results will be available this Saturday...and I'm super afraid and anxious although I have no symptoms at all.

I was HIV positive (preliminary results), it was rather jarring but I was fairly calm through the whole experience. I had gone to my friend Michelle's house to disclose the news to her first (most understanding ally and friend every) and she was amazing about the whole thing even came over later that night to get a little fucked up, because why not? 

But, then I told my friend Rick.... This was a mistake. He is roughly the same age (30) and very hetero.... At first he was fine and then he started with ""well I think we shared a drink a few weeks ago, do you think I could have gotten it?"" to which I educated him that there is no way that could happen from us merely ""sharing"" a drink. 

I've been planning an Autumn dinner party at my house (this coming weekend). I had been texting him all weekend asking if he was coming, and I figured that he was being his usual absent self, but yesterday he text me ""I don't mean to ignore. I'm honestly scared that I somehow got HIV too. That's where my focus has been"". I reassured him that sharing or sipping off of the same drink is not a way to transmit the disease, I also sent him links to websites backing this information. He told me he went and got tested and is waiting for the results. 

I'm not upset that he went to go get tested. I'm upset that he blatantly ignored me, refuses to believe any information I gave him, refused to talk to me about it first before making me feel like I had fucked him in the ass myself. He's always been a fairly ""off"" kind of friend. He disappeared  2 years ago when I got sober (2 years sober until July), because I didn't party or drink anymore. I've always been the one to lend a hand or help him whenever he needs it without asking for anything in return. 

I guess why I'm posting is because I don't know if I should consider him a friend or just cut the connection all together. I just feel like I'm being an asshole, but he is too."

Hello!
A friend had protected sex with CSW, had dry cough for 4-5 days after 3 weeks. Oral thrush intermittently. And sore throat, almost for 3 months!
He had three tests after 100 days of contact 
HIV-1 RNA PCR
4th generation Elisa and 
Rapid TRIDOT test
All were negative 
After 4 months had maculopapular non-itchy rash both forearms, which went off on its own after 10 days.
Then had diarrhea for 4 weeks 
Intermittent oral thrush is still on.
 His 6 months 4th generation hiv test was also negative. Does he need any other tests?"

I was diagnosed with HIV at 22. Was in a longterm relationship at the time. *(And to clarify, every boyfriend I've had has started and left our relationships negative. 1 pill a day guys. It's not as complicated as some of you make it seem)* 

Not knowing anything other than gay fear and stigma at the time, I was pretty horrified. But after speaking with my HIV doctor, having my partner speak with my HIV doctor, and doing research, I calmed down. I got used to taking my pill. And life continued. Then, I decided to tell a friend about it.

Now, this wasn't my best friend in the world, but he was a close online buddy I would occasionally hang with IRL too. We'd talk everyday for a few months, then go silent for a few because of life, but there was never any bad blood between us. Not until I decided to share my status with him. 

The moment I told him he went quiet. I must've typed about 6 paragraphs explaining my thoughts, feelings, and just ramblings on everything. I was just unloading, which we did with one another whenever we spoke, and I got a message back saying ""can we stop talking about this, it makes me uncomfortable."" 

That kinda... irked me? Oh, the thing I've been grappling with for months on end is making YOU uncomfortable? Okay. I didn't react with anger or frustration though, I simply asked him why, and his response was one that a lot of ignorant people have. ""Because I always think I might have it."" 

I followed up with ""when did you last get tested.""

His response. ""Oh, a few years ago."" 

Me: ""Why don't you get tested."" 

Him ""Because I might have it, but I probably don't so it's fine.""

This made my blood boil. Someone who has HIV and is undetectable is not going to give you HIV. Someone who doesn't have a clue what their status is can give you HIV. I tried to explain this to him but he didn't want to hear it. I can't remember how mad I got, (because I got it from someone who didn't know their status, so I may have lashed out a little) but it ended with him saying something along the lines of ""I don't think I can handle speaking with you anymore. Bye."" And off he went, blocking me from everything.

Just because you don't know it doesn't mean you don't have it. And if you get a result that's positive, you'll get on the medication you need and never put anyone at risk again.

So I know this question gets asked a lot, but I was wondering if anyone could give me some insight please.
I am on PreP, so effective HIV prevention tool correct? The issue is that when I last engaged in a sexual encounter I don’t recall if I had been consistent in taking it. 

What happened I think is this:

I gave an unknown guy a blow job on Friday 18th September. He didn’t ejaculate in my mouth.
I believe I had taken a pill at least 3-4 times in the 7 days prior to this. I also on the night took a pill 2hrs before the encounter, and then another 10 minutes before the encounter (guess drunk me figured take two just in case?). 
Since then I haven’t missed any. 
On 2nd of October I gave another guy a Blowjob but again no within the mouth. Was on PreP.

Do you guys think I’m safe? It’s coming up to a month with the first dude so I can get tested soon but I’m worried. I can help poke an prod my body looking for stuff. It seems like the lymph nodes seem to be bigger and are painful in my groin. I’m also very tired a lot of the time.

Would you guys use condoms for a BJ? It just seems so awkward to suggest that.

Any help would be greatly appreciated."

To me, it's like telling someone afraid of flying in a plane that planes are the safest mode of transportation. You can hold a lecture about it, show the statistical proofs and you'd probably still end up with a deadly afraid person. To me, I don't want to be the last generation to receive this disease, and with some of the luck that I have in my life I'd catch before I get PrEP.  

I did some oral stuff 6 days ago, and now I have a slight throat ace. Never mind the ongoing *fucking* pandemic, the seasonal colds. Instead, my mind thinks it's HIV.

I met a guy, thought he was attractive. After chatting for a few days we met up. I'm negative, not on prep. He told me he was negative and on prep. While messing around (him straddling me) he kept trying to force my dick in him without a condom. He was successful 2 times but I kept pulling it out. I constantly asked him about condoms but he said he didn't have any and that he was negative and on prep. I didn't actually top him because I wasn't going to without protection. I found it weird that he didn't have condoms and in just meeting me for the first time that he would be so trusting to force me dick in him. 

I met up with him a second time with condoms this time. I asked him again about his status, he told me he was negative and on prep but he kept the prep at his job because he doesn't want anyone to find it. Mind you, he lives alone. My instincts were now on high alert because I found out that he also was 5 years older than he told me initially. 

I asked him to send me a pic of the prep bottle when he got to work. He didn't. He met up with me and showed me the pills. When I googled they were biktarvy which isn't for hiv prevention but treatment. When confronted about it he got visibly nervous and agitated and asked me to leave his car because I was stressing him out. 

I got tested 2 weeks after the exposure and I'm negative. While I didn't top him per say, my penis was still in him raw for 3 seconds or less. The dishonesty could have had catastrophic effects. Now I'm grappling with whether or not to report him to the authorities (I'm in Florida). Things like this can damage someone's health. He blatantly lied and put me in harm's way. 

What are your thoughts?"

I have been having panic attacks and health anxiety for 10 days because I have done oral sex with a guy. I didn’t ejaculated in his mouth but I had a lot of pre-cum and I washed my teeth 2 hours before sex. Here is the story of what happened;

In my first date, we walked together and kissed me (closed mouth). Then we talked, he said “I broke up with my boyfriend because I was cheated”. Then I was like ok, but then he went to his dorm and I wait him like 1 hour. Then after that he came to my dorm and he wanted to give me blowjob and I first asked that whether he had STD or not. He said “no” and asked me back and I said “no”. Anyways, when he arrived at my dorm, he wanted to do sex with me but I said let’s watch movie. Then we are watching movie, his face was like but I was expecting sex. So due to my failure, we started touching then started to do some oral sex. He was the one mostly giving me the bj. I gave him a little bit because he was smelling really bad. We did a little 69. Then touching and kissing again. Then when he got his room, I said “ was it good?” He said yes it was. But then he blocked when I woke up.

What I am suspicious about is;
1-) I done an oral sex (and brushed my teeth 2 hours ago) with a white college student, so am I in the high risk category ?

*Not sure about whether there was open wounds or not.

*I give him a little bj and both of us didn’t ejaculated (but I am suspicious about pre-cum even though he was not as massive as me)

2-)He blocked me on Snapchat after things done, I suspect about three things;
   *Was he trying to transmit me the HIV?
   *Was it because of my awkward behavior when I was dating him?
   *His intention was hookup but he tried to do that under “dating”?

3-)If it was a hookup, he maybe doing the same thing to other people, so he might have slept with an HIV+ person

4-)After 7 days I had swollen tonsils, but now they are getting normal, is it a HIV symptom?

I went to doctor and she get tested after 3 months, but I am so worried and having a lot of panic attacks due to this. Also a lot of exam anxiety and having problems to concentrate. What should I do to calm down? How possible to get HIV from this person?"

It may sound silly but I have some possible thrush in my mouth, and loose stool. When you google thrush HIV is very prevalent in the results. I had a cold last week (2 others in the house had it too) Sinus congestion, runny nose, sneezing, sinus headache.

I slept with my trans (MtF) friend I’ve met at uni and now I’m scared of contracting HIV. We got a bit a drunk and slept together but only had protected anal (I was top) and she then gave me a blowjob with no condom, I didn’t ejaculate due to being fairly drunk. I don’t wanna be offensive and ask her if she is safe from HIV but a week after I got a pretty bad flu (it’s getting cold in my country) and at first I thought it was coronavirus so I went and got tested for that. Came back negative. After that I’ve had no other symptoms, except for a small bump above my tooth crown :/  there was no noticeable blood involved and we are both fairly clean except the drinking that night, I only topped with condom and received unprotected oral with no ejaculation.

1) is this a high risk situation? 

2) I was thinking of getting a rapid HIV test this Monday, do u think 4 weeks after exposure is enough? If not I know they do tests that take 3 days to get results from lab, would this be better instead?

I just want to know if anyone has been through this and come out positive so I can use the remaining 20 days to mentally prepare myself for the rest of my life . 

It was such an unfortunate string of bad decisions. Having lots of coffee before drinking that led me to seriously underestimate how drunk I was, that led me to that point. In bed with a stranger. Having unprotected sex . Unconscious for most of it . And then being the eternal optimist I thought said stranger would eventually agree to do the self test so I wasted 2.5 days calling him and begging him to meet me for the test. 

In hindsight I should have gone straight to hospital the morning after .

What are the odds
-both sex workers have hiv
-while me catching hiv from a 1 night stand
-both sex workers having hvp
-catching it from a 1 night stand

Also I am 28, and relatively healthy I heard that hvp has a very high chance of not turning chronic right?

TL;DR: I just contracted an STI from my boyfriend, after having sex with him for the past two months. He just told me he'd had unprotected sex with a stranger shortly before he met me, and has not been tested since. I freaked out about HIV. How can I forgive him for this breach of trust?

Full story:

I'm a ""formerly straight"" man (top), early 30s. After being curious for a while, I recently realized/confirmed that I am bisexual. For most of my life until my current partner (bottom, early 20s), I have only dated/slept with women. The world of gay sex, and the gay community in general, is still very new to me. I just had an HIV scare, due to risky behavior on his part, and it has left me furious with him, because I feel like he put me at risk by being careless and dishonest. (We both got tested today. His was a rapid test, and, thank God, it was negative.)

As someone who has not spent his life in the gay community, like he has, I am hoping for some perspective here - I am having a really hard time getting into his head and trying to understand how he could have let this happen, and I was hoping some people who have been in either his position or mine can help me understand. I am crazy about him, and have very deep feelings for him, so this really hurts.

I met him at the end of August. About a week before we met, he'd been on vacation in another country. We clicked instantly, and had great chemistry. Since we first met up, we've been seeing each other every weekend. After about a month, we became an official couple, but even before that, we both confirmed that neither of us was seeing other people after we met each other.

We had anal sex for the first time sometime around the end of September or beginning of October, and have been having sex every weekend since then, every time without protection. Stupid, I know - I didn't ask him for his detailed history or testing. We'd been dating a few weeks, I thought I knew his character, and I had developed trust for him. Early this week, I developed symptoms of an STI, most likely gonorrhea or chlamydia (currently waiting on test results, but the doctor told me from visual examination &amp; symptoms that it looks like one of those two). I asked my boyfriend if he had been tested since his last partner before me, and he said no. Uh oh. Even worse, he said the person before me had been a stranger, a drunken one-night stand during his vacation, with no protection, AND he hadn't asked the guy if he'd been tested. Jesus Christ.

At this point, I'm sure you know why I was furious. After some research, I realize now that HIV in the gay community it's not what it was in the 80s/90s, but it's still such a risk, and EVERY gay man knows this. The gay men I've been close to in my life, mostly older family members, all have countless friends who died from AIDS. It's so heartbreaking. I met one of them, my uncle's friend, who had had AIDS for years, and then all of a sudden, he just dropped dead a week after I met him and was hanging out with him. That is the only gay community I am familiar with, my friends &amp; family in their 50s and 60s. So, in my mind, having bareback anal with a stranger is like playing Russian roulette. I always thought it was a huge taboo, and for good reason. I always thought it's so dangerous that you just *don't do it,* unless you are monogamous.

My immediate reaction was to imagine myself in his situation, in which case I would have NEVER done what he did. Never, in my previous hetero sex life, would I ever have had condomless sex with some random girl from a bar, without even asking about her history or testing. Say I got drunk and made a stupid mistake, though - I would have woken up the next morning, said ""oh shit!,"" and then gotten tested *immediately.* Furthermore, no way in hell would I have had unprotected with a new partner before getting my test results, or without even telling them ""I had unprotected sex with a stranger a few weeks ago, are you comfortable with that?"" Now, add in the heightened risk of HIV with bareback anal sex, and I was livid that he would be so reckless, not only with himself, but with ME. Again - it's not so much the fact that he gave me chlamydia or whatever that bothers me. It's the fact that he put me - and himself - at risk for HIV.

By no means have I been perfect - I've had oral sex with strangers without knowing their history, and then hooked up with new partners without getting tested. This isn't smart, either. But penetration is a whole other ball game. I've also made plenty of mistakes in my life, and done stupid, reckless things. But I just cannot for the life of me understand this. The closest thing I've done, which I can try and compare his behavior to, is some drunk driving in my early 20s, which was fucking idiotic and dangerous, but at least with that, I had the illusion, however foolish, that I was in control, since I was the one driving the car. Having raw sex with a random hookup seems more like voluntarily driving down a highway with a bunch of drunk drivers on the road. You can't even fool yourself into thinking that you're controlling the risk. It's a complete roll of the dice.

So: trying to put myself in his head, I was thinking that he knew he was at risk for HIV, and then had unprotected sex with me, essentially saying ""fuck it"" to the risk of passing it on to me. After talking to him about it, though, it genuinely seems like this wasn't the case - it seems like this was a matter of some major naivety and poor thinking on his part, rather than poor morals or being cavalier with my health. Let me explain - and I'll say now that, knowing his character in every other way, I have no reason to doubt that he's being honest about this thoughts and intentions, and not just trying to cover his ass. He's an exceptionally kind, gentle, and caring person, which is why this was all so shocking to me. It might also be worth mentioning that he grew up in another country, in a rural area, until he moved here as a teenager, so maybe the sex education there wasn't the same, but that hardly seems like an excuse.

Immediately, after I told him I had caught something, he was extremely apologetic and embarrassed. This was all via text. He said he was sorry repeatedly, and said that he literally didn't think about it, because he didn't have any symptoms, and hadn't been sleeping around - this was a one-off hookup after not being with anyone else for a while. He said he didn't hook up a lot, it was just a one-time thing. He is NOT on PrEP, by the way. He said that for the past couple years, he usually didn't have sex with strangers, and usually asks about their history, but for whatever reason (alcohol), didn't ask this time. He said he hadn't been worried about the risk with him because it was just one person one time, and the guy ""looked healthy."" I could tell he felt really terrible about this. He said he'd immediately get an appointment to get tested.

Now, I can totally understand making a drunken mistake. Like I said, I've made a lot of terrible drunken mistakes. But what I just could not wrap my head around was his lack of concern AFTER making this mistake. Somehow, in his head, this didn't amount to enough of a risk to be concerned after the fact. He said it had been hard to get tested after getting home, because of limited time, and he thought he was okay since he didn't have any symptoms. I kept asking him and trying to figure out what he was thinking by sleeping with me, and he said he just WASN'T thinking. It's not that in the back of his mind, he knew he had risky sex and hadn't been tested, and set that thought aside in order to have sex with me, but rather, that thought wasn't even in the back of his mind, or anywhere else in his mind. He had been so unconcerned by his hookup that, at the point when we were sleeping together, it didn't even register.

Again - it's very clear to me that he feels TERRIBLE. He feels so bad about scaring me with this, bad about giving me an infection, and bad about his choice and lack of thinking. I really do not believe that this was a case of him being careless with his knowledge that he might be at risk - rather, this was a case of him SOMEHOW being so incredibly foolish as to feel sure that he wasn't at risk. I still just cannot understand his thought process, here - or lack of thought process. He's not 13 years old. How does an adult who's been sexually active in the gay community in this country for the past decade, seriously think that if you don't have any symptoms, and it was only ""one time,"" you're fine, nothing to worry about?

So - please help me. Help me see his perspective. Help me forgive him. Help me understand how he could have been so foolish about this. Am I blowing it out of proportion? Has HIV gone down so much in the gay community that people just aren't worried about it anymore? As an outsider in the gay world, is my fear of HIV, and the risks of unprotected anal sex, out of proportion? Is it not this big, scary boogeyman that it seems like to me? Can any of you put yourself in his shoes and help me understand? Thank you so much.


EDIT- after seeing the first few comments, let me clarify that yes, of course I am an idiot, I am painfully aware of the many ways I behaved stupidly and immaturely in this situation. This is obviously not my finest hour, and I blame myself and my carelessness for the situation I'm in. I'm not pardoning myself; I'm differentiating putting myself at risk- which is what I did- and putting someone else at risk too, which is what he did. That's what I am struggling with. Thanks."

So recently I've been bicurious a lot and decided to get on grindr, I've been on it for a while but didn't really met any interesting people or boys who I was attracted too. Fast forward some weeks and I actually went on a date twice but with two different people, in the same week (call me a slut...). Both dates were really hot and experimenting was definitely a lot of fun. But for some reason I can't help myself thinking about HIV and how I might've put myself at risk. Definitely because grindr is a really fucking weird place.

To give an exampe what went down on the dates to get a better view I'll list the sexual actions below:

Date 1: Got a blowjob, kissing, jerked eachother off, rubbing dicks together, body humping and I fingered his hole. He also placed by dick between his cheeks so I might've touched his hole with my head but never went inside. We both came. I don't recall his sperm touching my dick.

Date 2: Got a blowjob, kissing, jerked eachother off, rubbing dicks together, body humping. I only came.

Partners were 18 and 20 years old which, I feel like would be a reduced risk since less sex partners? I know date 1 was against STDS but didn't really ask date 2 (he was really nice and shy so I assume so, doesn't make sense I know...) I know I should've asked and maybe start wearing condoms through all interactions.

I brought condoms with me incase I was going to top for the first time but my dick never went inside.

Now I'm being incredibly scared, what would my chances be I contracted it? I know there's a big stigma around HIV but nontheless I'm fucking scared. I will get tested but I read that I have to wait some weeks for HIV to become detectable."

I had a horrible reaction to that drug immediately, pheirphal nuerotherapy, burning sensation on my chest, nausea, diarrhea, back pain and joint pain! I was freaking out.

So on the 25th  day after exposure I got tested because I was losing my mind. It was a 4th gen test and came back negative. But I was reading that the drugs prolly suppressed my antibodies or Antigens! So I’m back to freak out!

After I finished meds, I had blurred vision a little and saw floaters, Idk if it stress or symptoms

32 day I took a Finger prick hiv1 &amp; 2 test negative 


46th day I took another finger prick hiv 1 &amp; 2 came back negative. (They told me these test start back at 3 weeks) that’s what the man said 

But ever since I finished taking all the medicine. One day I was very fatigued, and now I’m getting joint and muscle aches. Not severe but they are there. Occasionally burning sensation on back sometime. And tingle in feet every now and then.slight sharp headaches that 1 like 2 seconds

I’m going taking another 4th Gen test Monday! Wish me luck I am terrified. I’ve been so stressed indulge in over drinking a lot and drugs/ coke. Which I know was wrong. Stupid mistake I made. I’m sure it’s gonna end bad but I just needed to vent  thank you"

I've been battling porn addiction and regular porn just wouldn't do it anymore for me. I started watching a bunch of different porn categories, including gay blowjobs. Whenever I got horny, I would reach for porn, different type of fetishes in straight porn ( like foot fetish which I didn't have before porn addiction ) and gay porn.

My friend came over 4 days ago. He turned on porn and one thing led to another and we gave each other handjobs and blowjobs.

This made me sure that I am not gay. It wasnt a bad experience, but I regretted it immediately after I came and post-nut clarity came in. I realized I only did it because of being super horny due to watching porn and being a teen + having 0 contact with other people and 0 relationships and being lonely for 13 months since my last big breakup.

I just regret it so much. I shouldn't have done it. But, one thing that bothers me more is HIV. Could I have gotten it from giving and recieving a blowjob? I asked him before we had oral, and he told me he never had any type of sex with another person before this. I wouldn't be surprised, as he isn't the most charming or hot guy and he claims he is straight ( this was just experimenting for him ) and he can't pull girls easily.

Should I worry about getting HIV? I am not worrying about other STDs because even if I get them, I can cure them. I am worried about HIV so much though. I can't even sleep properly. I wish I could get back in time and never do that."

so i had a risk contact about 6 weeks ago. I don't know the status of the contact. She says no. (she's a trans) 1 week after contact i got a very light non itching rash on the torso. I got tested negative 2 weeks after. The doctor said i should come back 3 months after. I did shave that area before contact so i'd like to attribute it to that. But the rash just doesn't go away. I have no other symptoms. No fever or anything. Just a very tiny ulcer in the gum 1 week after which did go away. The rash is becoming less. It's in the right area of the torso and very light. Just red spots. 

I now noticed that when i take a cold shower it expands over the whole torso and near the left shoulder. Becomes more red also. Spots. Non itching. I also got red spots on the back but not anywhere else on the body. This could be a reaction to cold showers in general. But what worries me is that it is assymetric on the torso and it only shows up in some spots. My question is if anyone who went trough this noticed a reaction like that with showers? 

I think it's a virus after all and lower temperatures might weaken the immun system temporarily or something like that."

&amp;#x200B;

Hi guys, recently I had a sexual encounter in which I lost my virginity. I wasn't really in the right mind to have the sexual encounter, since I was drunk and high, but it happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

From what I remember, he did use a condom, I was just too tight for him to penetrate me until the end of the encounter. When he did penetrate me, he didn't last more than 2 minutes (I estimate) but when I tossed the condom I noticed a small tear and I just became really paranoid and so I got PEP about 24ish hours after the encounter. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been taking Truvada and Isentress as prescribed, with the latter being twice daily and the former being once daily. I'm just in a really dark place right now because I have accidentally missed Isentress being on time, usually taking it within an hour or two. But today I completely forgot to take my first dose and I just took it. Am I going to be okay? I'm so scared and I don't have any gay friends or anyone to talk about this with because I'm just so ashamed of the situation in general. I feel really alone and scared. I don't even know why I'm posting this. I guess I just want to know if these missed doses will mean something, if anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

Im going to sleep in about 5 hours, can I take today's second dose then? Im open to all ideas. Thanks guys."

I’m going to open up entirely here because I want you guys to get the full story. I do think I could have HIV, but I want you guys to know everything, and I’d love some advice. 

Long story short, I was raised in a very conservative Christian atmosphere, and was told that having any sort of feelings for the same sex was like the worst evil ever. I’m 21, btw. I tried to fight urges I’d been experiencing since I was 16, but at 21, I finally gave into them and accepted that I am bisexual. This is where I did something admittedly dumb; I met strangers on here to give blowjobs to. It was only three, and I got proof of HIV negative from two of them, and only went so far as blowjobs. I didn’t swallow, I didn’t put my mouth on anything after it... um... finished. None of that. From what I’ve researched, the chances I got anything from oral are like... astronomically low to nonexistent. But I have been having some flu like symptoms recently (which could also be attributed to lack of sleep due to my exams), and a bit of a rash on my armpits (which could be due to the stress of possibly having HIV along with exams). 

Unfortunately, I can’t get tested right now... because I’m back home. My family doesn’t know I’m bi, and they monitor my activities closely when I’m home. They would become suspicious quickly. Additionally, I’m terrified of having it, because they may kick me out and/or cut me off of the funds they still have been gracious enough to send my way. I can’t ask them to help me pay for HIV treatment, and I’m honestly not sure I can even tell them, because they would hate me. I know I didn’t act in the smartest way, believe me, but I got caught up in college freedom and just got impulsive like a fucking moron, which I know I shouldn’t have.

A FWB of mine just told me that he'd hooked up with a stranger the other day.

Stranger came in condom and they parted ways.

The problem is that me and FWB hooked up the very next day. FWB didn't tell me until after but I'm now concerned as we don't know Stranger's HIV status. Obviously I'm mad at FWB for not telling me after and won't be seeing him again - I advised him to speak to a clinic about being put on PEP.

My concern is basically that I've been infected. Me and FWB only engaged in oral and ass play, but I do have a cut on my gum and he came in my mouth. If FWB gets a baseline test done when he goes to get PEP and comes out negative, is there any chance at all that I've been infected? Since the virus hasn't had time to replicate?

After some time he got more aggressive (biting, pulling my hair, forced deepthroating). I didn’t think too much about it, as I am fine with a little bit of rougher sex. After that he pushed up my legs and tried to fuck me (bareback). When I stud up, he pushed me down again and laid on me, while trying to get into me. I pushed him to the side and while bending down to put on my clothes he tried again. All of his attempts for anal were unsuccessful. His penis stayed out of my butt the whole time

He didn’t manage to have anal sex with me. But I guess, I am safe to assume, this is not the first time he forced bareback sex on someone or is into unprotected sex.

Since he deep throathed me, I was wondering if there is a realistic risk to contract HIV from deep throating and precum? He didn’t cum at all, but I am sure precum was involved.

Thanks for your help."
kc32pi,Do you think HIV+ undetectable people should disclose their status?,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/kc32pi/do_you_think_hiv_undetectable_people_should/,Jerisstiss,1,12/12/2020 19:13,79,/r/askgaybros/comments/kc32pi/do_you_think_hiv_undetectable_people_should/,NaN,"I came across this passage recently. What do you think?(I need to do my own research here, and, of course, you technically should be on PrEP):

""Here’s an important fact that everyone always forgets: Meta analysis of regimen compliance studies has shown that 43% of HIV patients on HAART have had less than a 95% rate of compliance since their last test which determined they were undetectable. And, 29% of patients had less than a 90% compliance rate since their last test which showed undetectable. I’m a sense, the study showed that being labeled undetectable actually has a negative impact on HAART compliance. Also, 95% compliance is a high bar. Of those with between 90% and 95% compliance, over 80% believed they had been fully compliant.

Now, combine that with these statistics: “Among patients with baseline undetectable viral loads, close to 0% had virological failure with &gt;95% rates of compliance, while close to 41% had virological failure with &lt;95% rates of compliance.”

So, here’s the takeaway: Hard data shows that even if someone tested undetectable during their last test, there is a 43% chance that they were &lt;95% compliant since then and a 41% chance that those who were non-compliant had virological failure. Thus, there’s around a 17% chance that the person telling you they are undetectable, actually IS NOT UNDETECTABLE ANYMORE.

So, yes, I think it is important to disclose your status even if you are undetectable, since while the risk of transmission while you are undetectable is negligible, the risk that your status has changed since your last test is 17%. Even if you believe you were fully compliant since then, the study also shows that patients are overwhelmingly bad at actually determining if that was true. Ethically speaking, you should let the other person determine their own risk tolerance. Don’t make that judgement for them."""

He offered me some water, and we started chatting, and he made a remark about having HIV(we were talking about how the recent Australian attempt at a COVID vaccine led to false positive HIV test results, and he joked about how the researchers were lucky they didn't have more guys like him in their trial).

I directly asked him if he was poz, and he said yes. I said that I was sorry but I wasn't comfortable having sex with him. He started talking about U=U, and I mentioned that I was on PrEP and used condoms, anyway. It was not about the almost nonexistent health issue. He said that I was a serophobe. I apologized for not asking for his HIV test results(I didn't want to cause conflict by mentioning what was either a not updated profile or a straight up lie.), and I left.

AITA?

I understand that this place is not to get medical advice but you guys have been amazing in the past so I wanted to ask you again.  


\* 8th &amp; 9th/11/2020 Exposure - Unprotected, top anal sex. (2 people)

  
\* 14/12/2020 - Go see a doctor who said to come back after 3 weeks and gave me precaution Teevir medication incase I was positive.

  
\* 19/11/2020 Test for bacteria from a Urethre Swap  - Result ""few"" Gram-Positive Cocci (normal bacteria)  
Prescribed multiple anti-biotics (Azithromycin 4x250 take at once and Augmentin 1g take 2 times per day for 1 week.

  
\*03/12/2020 -  Medication finished tested for VDRL (first) - Non-REactive, Anti HIV (CLIA) - Negative, HBsAg - Negative and Anti HCV - Negative. Was told to come back the following week for a second HIV test as it was just under the 28-day testing window. (was given more Teevir just in case)  


\*10/12/2020 - Got second Anti-HIV (CLIA) test, which also shown negative and the doctor has advised me that I shouldn't keep taking the medication anymore, but I would need to go back in 3 months to be 100% sure. 

  
\*15/12/2020 - I found a small lump in my testicle and I had some shape pains for 3-4 days, so I went to get checked, ultrasound shown it was a cyst maybe caused by infection so they took a swap once again of my Urethra. This time it came back;

PNM - Rare, Gram-Positive Cocci - Moderate, Gram-Negative Diplococci - Rare, Gram-positive Bacilli - Rare.

So this shows that I have no tested positive for my bacteria found in my Urethra. I was then given a shot of Rocephin (worst pain I have ever felt, still can't wait properly today), Fluconazole 200mg, Doxycycline 100mg for 2 weeks and azithromycin 5 days.  


I have been told to go back in 2 weeks to get retested for everything, as he said that the Hep and syphilis was tested too early, so the tests were useless (i thought it was still quite accurate for these). He also said the HIV test would need to be repeated as 32 days isn't clear. (I thought it was 95% accurate after 28 days).   


I guess the reason for this post is, I am really worried once again, especially considering I have new found bacteria in my Urethra, and why it was still there after the antibiotics I have taken the first time.  


Is it possible that the Teevir I was taken, has made the test a false negative for HIV?, and the bacteria that I have are resistant to the antibiotics that they gave to me originally. Also, Hepatitis B and C, and Syphilis is 4 weeks to early to catch these infections?  


I also shown some symptoms such as a soar throat and a cough 2 weeks after exposure and they remained for around 1 week (nothing serious) but now they have completely gone.  


Sorry for the long post, I just hope maybe there is someone out there that can tell me the reason for these new bacterias and if the testing is accurate that has been done so far.  


Thanks for your time guys.

Have you noticed it or do you disagree? How so? Or Why?

Hello homosexual brethren!

For the last couple of weeks I have been voraciously consuming any kind of information on the HIV pandemic and it’s effects on the LGBT+ community whose zeitgeist believe to still be sending ripples into the ways we all have chosen to respectively defined our view of gay culture. I’m working on a project examining the effects that the COVID 19 pandemic has had on drug use within the LGBT+ community using the HIV pandemic as a point of reference in hopes of bringing to light a issue that seems to be growing with hope to cultivate support and empathy through community. I’d love to hear anything you guys would like to share on your experience living life as a gay man. 

I joke that I got my ugly phase out of the way in high school and it’s the only reason I haven’t killed myself  which is a glimpse at my morbid sense of humor and a defense mechanism that gets triggered when I feel uncomfortable that I use to “level the playing field” when I feel embarrassed, less than, or like I want to leave but I don’t want to be rude. It stems from a stupid about of catholic guilt I can’t seem to let go of and an overall low self esteem around feeling like no mater how hard I try I will never be good enough because my worth is 100% tied to my looks and that if a guy actually got to know me they would bail as soon as they realize that I’m kinda neurotic, a hot head, obsessive compulsive, and as my ex put it “obsessed with complaining no one is at your pity party when you never sent out invitations cause you know you deserve being alone” which... 
is fair. 
What’s that one Princess Nokia Quote, “rather eat by myself than dine with bologna”? Lol I digress...

Point I’m trying to make through all this talking about myself is that I tend to make a lot of self destructive decisions in attempt to find community or someone who wants to stick around after we don’t have to hold each other to stay aflote. 

I’m a month sober today after 3 years of drug addiction and I’ve been reading a ton of non fiction cause I don’t like fiction lol and it helps make me feel connected to a community I still don’t really feel at home in. Currently Im a quarter through How to Survive a Plague and Spencer Cox’s story just made me feel the need to ask people who have something to share about HIV or their experiences navigating a world where being different plages your life like a cancer. He’s disdain and feelings of abandonment after antiretrovirals saved so many lives really hit home and I felt sadness for myself through his experience. 

Anything you would like to share is cool.

The date itself went good(in my opinion), we drank a few tall cans and one thing lead to another. Before we fucked, I had asked about his health status and he claimed he was std free, I had confirmed I was std free too. After he popped it in my ass, and I asked him to pull out because he was hurting me(no lube or spit whatsoever ...). He said “ hey I need to be honest, I am undetectable”. So we proceeded because I understand U=U. We hung out again and I had bottomed for him four days later. He nutted in me both times. I allowed this because I was really into him and am also on PrEp! I don’t miss a dosage and I take it at the same time everyday. The outcome of this is he just saw me as a piece of meat, and unfortunately I caught feelings for him . 

Anyways that’s just the back story to it, 
as of last night I started experiencing headaches (this being abnormal as I don’t really tend to have headaches). I believe it feels as if I have tension from the back of my head and I think I feel it on my temples. Today the headache lingered, it faded after I took naproxen but as I am typing this I am currently experiencing pain. I did go to a local clinic to get a rapid test and I tested negative (I was told it can be detected as early as 10 days of exposure). I am also a hypochondriac and I always assume the worst.. 

He told me he caught it 3 years ago and i’d like to think he is being smart by taking his medication daily cuz ultimately it would affect his health. But let’s say worst case scenario he did have a viral detectable load, PREP should be able to fight of the virus ? 

So my question is for those whom do have HIV , was one of your initial symptoms headaches? If so where did you feel the pain exactly ?

2.10 years ago i had unprotected sex with hiv+ men who's not on meds (i did not take prep). A few weeks after that i had runny nose, headache,sore throat and rash.
I did the 4th Generation HIV Ag/Ab duo test
28th day: inconclusive/indeterminate
at one year negative 
at 2.10 years negative
my ongoing symptoms for the past 2.8 years: 
Persistent submandibular Lymph nodes
Oral thrush
Chronic Sinusitis
Joints pain 
Muscle loss 
I know that hiv is not diagnosed by symptoms but my doctor did additional blood test apart from hiv/std which showed 
nothing is abnormal which can explain that the symptoms im having can possibly be due to the hiv(spear me the you have anxiety comments) . My question is why does the 4th generation ag/ab duo test won't detect the infection after 2.10 years?(did not had another exposure) could i be seronegative? 

*Also i consulted via email an infectious disease physician who said ""I would be evaluated for HIV with a confirmatory test besides the 4th generation test such as HIV viral load test."""

Long story short, I hooked up with a guy last night. I don’t know who he is or if he even has HIV or not. The act included anything but anal sex (kissing, oral etc), so we didn’t use any protection.

I got a little scared about the risk, and I’ll explain why, but I just want to clarify that it’s gonna get a bit graphic.

He came on his stomach, and we flipped so his semen dripped on my penis and I kinda used it as lube to jerk off. As I did it his penis (which was covered with semen) touched the area of my butt, I don’t think it got on my asshole but idk maybe it dripped or something?
Also I had some scratches on the back of my hand that bled earlier that day, the scratched had dried hours before we hooked up but I don’t know if that is dangerous because his semen definitely got on my hands.

I don’t know what to do, I’m nervous but I’m pretty sure I’m overthinking, but It’s better to be safe than sorry. I’m going to take an STD test anyway, and I wanted you know if you guys think I have something to worry about. Thanks"

I recorded my first potential exposure to this virus last Nov. 6, 2020. 

I met a guy and he gave me oral sex. We also kissed and he licked by hole for a few seconds. No mouth sores but I did brushed my teeth an hour before. 

Then on Dec. 15 (5-6weeks later) I started to feel sick. I got diarrhea first then a very low grade fever. Then after a few hours I got sore throat and a fever 39c Celsius. It responded well to meds and after one day, I was already okay but I had sweats since I turned off my airconditioner. The next morning I returned to the gym. I asked him about his status he said he was clean but Assuming he is positive, what are my chances i caught hiv?

It is by this time I got anxious with HIV. After a week I think I got swollen neck lymph node ( just one ) but Im not sure if it was there all the time since I searched and found results that neck nodes are always palpable. Mine did but it was not painful. 

Now, I started to develop some itchiness ( looks like hives though since it appears and disappears rapidly at random places ) and I hope it’s not rashes. 

I also got sores in my mouth but it also disappeared rapidly like a day or two and it usually appears after I eat something acidic or hot. 

Should HIV symptoms appear at the same time or in stages? 

I already read a lot here and I’m trying my best to convince that my chances of contracting the virus is almost zero. 

I already bought 3 pairs of hiv test kit to end my anxiousness once and for all. It will arrive within the week. 

TL;DR

1. Chances of HIV transmission during Insertive Oral Sex ( me being blown )?
2. Chances of HIV transmission during Analingus?

I live in a country with 0.1% prevalence if HIV as of 2019. Just an additional information."

I forgot about it all this time, and then randomly thought that it had been 6 months since my first experience, and remembered reading that testing should be done every 6 months?

After doing a little research, I saw that the eye is a mucosal membrane and that there is a risk of transmission, so needless to say I'm panicking and so nervous...

I've read that once HIV infected cum is exposed to air, it dies/becomes inactivated/can't transmit HIV. I can't find any info on that though?

&amp;#x200B;

1. Do I need to be worried about contracting HIV from this?
2. Has anyone ever contracted HIV through the eye or nose?
3. Does HIV virus in semen truly get inactivated the split second it comes out a penis and is exposed to oxygen/air?

About two weeks ago, I had a hook-up with a guy, it was the second time with him, the first time we fucked with a condom, the second I didn't want any penetration. However, at some point, in this second time, he rubbed his bare glans (that previously had precum) against my anus, which is what made me come. He didn't penetrate. How dangerous would that be with regards to HIV transmission? His scruff profile says he's on PrEP (I have no idea how he takes it though) and he's been asking me about doing bareback, but I declined. Basically, I felt like he wanted to penetrate me, but didn't, hence the 'rubbing'.

I just have a legit question about oral sex and hiv. I’m 19 (M). I performed oral sex with a man on Nov. 30 2020(he didn’t ejaculate in my mouth) not sure if there was pre-cum tho. When I went back home from the encounter and brushed my teeth my gums were bleeding, then I remembered that my gums were also bleeding when I brushed my teeth before the encounter and I also had bit my cheek like a day before so there was a slight cut. 

Almost 2 weeks after the encounter, my occipital lymph node at the back-right side of my head started to swell and around that time too I developed nasal congestion which eventually developed into a postnasal drip, I think I have a sinus infection. I believe that I had like a mouth sore that lasted for a few days. I have had these symptoms for almost a month now and the sinus infection isn’t getting better and my lymph node became hard. Albeit, I haven’t experienced any other symptoms.

I got tested yesterday (35 days after possible exposure) for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and HIV as advised by my doctor. The other 2 came out negative and I’m just waiting for my HIV result. I am just extremely terrified because I had never had these symptoms before and they coincide with the time period that HIV symptoms should occur. I know that the risks for oral sex is extremely low but my mind is already conditioned into thinking that I have HIV especially when I had bleeding gums and the cut in the cheek during my encounter. 

I don’t know what I’m getting into writing this post, I think I just want someone to talk to about my situation because I literally have nobody to talk to about this because I just feel so isolated right now. And could anybody please help me through the process of getting help if ever I get a Positive result, I just really need emotional support 🥺.

I was the bottom. After that incident, I tested negative for HIV, but I never had anal sex again. After seeing therapist for 2 years, things got a little better for me. I started dating/seeing people again. But when it comes to sex, I'm only willing to have the least risky sex (non-penetration and non-oral). And I do enjoy foreplay quite a lot. This is the background.

I was seeing a guy on and off before COVID. He was kind enough to accept that i only do foreplay and light sex. And he enjoyed that too. Since he hadn't had an HIV test for a long time, I encouraged him to have one. My plan was that if he showed me his negative HIV result, I would really want to have oral and anal sex with him. However, things didn't go as I planned. After he got his negative test result, he told me about it, but didn't offer to show me the actual result. I knew he was not obliged to do so, but at that moment I became paranoid again. I wanted to trust him, but I really hoped that he could show me the result, which would totally eliminate my fear. I was also so reluctant to ask him to do that. He was a good friend with or without benefit. I was so afraid that I could drove him away. 

Then, we continued as fwb with only light sex. Then I became aware that he started having more sex partners that are willing to have riskier sex with him. Although I felt that I ruined some potential good connection, it was not so bad for me before COVID, as I also occasionally saw other guys for intimacy.

With the COVID going on, my feeling became worse and worse. There are still sexually active people out there that are super adventurous. He is probably one of them too. Knowing that he is sexually active with other guys during all of this makes me both jealous and envious. The feeling is really melting me down. This is not something I can talk to my family and I don't have a lot of friends. My therapist is also on vacation.

&amp;#x200B;

Just got a negative result on a self test but not nearly as relieved as I expected to feel.

That was a terrifying 15 minutes... However I am nervous I didn't get quite get enough blood. The test has come up as negative, there is one line not two. If I didn't get enough blood I was definitely close to enough, the little bit was full im sure but it took a couple of tries touching it to my finger to fill it up (was about half full initially), on the picture it shows it going like further up and spreading out, mine didn't spread out only went into the thin part, the diagram has a red line above that Im not sure if that is meant to be blood or like showing you how far up its meant to go. It's a Biosure test, I would post a picture of the diagram if I could but I'm not sure how.

Im sorry for how disjointed this question is I think my mind is creating anxiety because like I was so convinced I had it (possibly unprotected drunk sex a year ago, now I have lost loads of weight, lost my appetite, reoccurring mouth ulcers). Thanks to anyone for their help im sure im coming across quite stupid rn.

If I didn't provide enough blood for an HIV test would it tell me im negative even if im positive? If I can post pictures I could share the result also"

Had trouble in sleep, and had to take sleep pills.

So it begins at october 5th, i was having a brief sex (i was the bottom), it was protected and the duration is no more than 5 minutes, at 29th october, i took a hiv test (4th gen) and donoring my blood for a friend, it came out negative and the blood bank said my blood is ok.

December 31th, i was having a hookup sex with another guy, same, i was the bottom, and protected. But i remember before he pushed in, he rubbed his unprotected penis on my butthole for a couple seconds (i think because he hadn’t turn on yet), then he wore the condom and lube all around then he pushed in. At 5th january, i got some flu like symptom (but maybe because of my dental problem)

These doubled my anxiety to this point, i’m afraid i have to wait two more weeks to get tested, but i just need some reassurance of the risk. I know i am responsible for what i did, but it burdens me. I was afraid that at those time, i wouldn’t be so lucky from my first time (unprotected anal but i tested out negative) and may contract the virus.

Thank you guys, I don’t know what else to do know other than just crying, I couldn’t eat anything and spend my days just on bed, thinking on potential terminal illness to come."

A little upset I have to make this post, but yesterday I met up with someone from Grindr because we both thought each other looked pretty cute. To start, I am in the US and 22 years old and still in college, so this makes it really bad for me as it will affect so many aspects of my life. I looked at his profile and it never said if he was positive or negative in his profile, but said last tested was last year (Nov) - unfortunately I only noticed that right after I left. We meet up, and I end up topping him without a condom (I was hoping it would not lead to not protected sex but it did). When I ejaculated, I think I did get some inside of him but pulled out to finish the rest out. Come today, I wanted to message him and chat a bit but turns out his Grindr profile is deleted. I did grab screenshots of pictures of him and our messages before his profile was deleted, but that won't help my case much. I want to get tested immediately if I could but 1) I know it takes 1-3 months for symptoms to start showing, and for the virus to be in my system, 2) I dont have health insurance, so getting PEP isnt an option since its too expensive, 3) I'm just freaking out about it now and have no idea what to do other than sit here and worry. 

The main thing that really freaks me out is why did he delete his profile after we hooked up and not say anything? Its also worrying that I wont know I have it until months later, and I may not even show symptoms of it now but will eventually. I'm really worried I have been infected and don't want to be worried for months. I just dont know what to do now because he doesnt have a profile so I cant even ask if he is clean.

As the tittle says, how easy is it? I see a lot of “i slipped in the heat of the moment” or “my boyfriend and i dont use condoms” and underneath both posts you have people throwing statistics at each other and catastrophizing the situation. 

So reddit for the last time please tell me the answer to this question because according to the internet its 0.1% per sex act and I really need to conclude my search over this stupid virus who is causing me panic attacks that I dont need

I had unprotected oral sex with someone from a dating app (my penis in his mouth). He said he was negative, but I didn't get to confirm. Not sure if he had any mouth problems then, and I didn't notice any blood on his mouth because it was dark. I am sure that my penis didn't have any open wounds or anything. 

After 6 weeks, I had an HIV 1/2 Quali test (CMIA, but based on their website it seemed to be only for antibodies). It was non reactive. I was wondering how accurate that result would be. I read somewhere that 95% of infections would have been caught at 6 weeks, but I'm not sure if that's for rapid tests or lab tests (I got my results within the day). 

I'm sorry for asking this question despite many people having already said that oral sex for the insertive partner only had a theoretical risk of transmission but my anxiety is killing me. I want to get another test, since it's been well over 3 months, but because of reasons, I can't really have another test. I also know that I have a bigger chance of getting other STI's, but I'm more worried of HIV since there's no cure for that, and it feels bad to think of getting a life-changing disease from just one blowjob.

He told me on our second date, and I didn’t bat an eyelash, of course, knowing how far we’ve come with anti virals; and he actually educated me on the U=U campaign. He’s been U for 6 years and has maybe missed a pill 5 times in 6 years. 

I feel bad writing about this without his consent so I may take this down shortly. He turns me on so much, I can’t fucking stand it!!!

I actually hurt my back (bulging disc) and we had some snow fall yesterday. He drove over to my house last night and shovelled me out as I slept, how goddamn cute and amazing is that???

I do have an interest in some advice with serpend..? Lol mixed couples in this case. If one partners viral load is now undetectable and you really trust them and you see the actual results on paper, is a condom unnecessary? I know technically that’s what U=U (undetectable equals untransmissible) really does mean. But what is everyone doing? Are we playing it extra safe if we trust the monogamy of the relationship anyway. Are we using Prep?

I’m already on Wellbutrin, Effexor, tecta, valtrex (yes for HSV2, he knows) and clanapazam, and taking another drug until I come off these brain meds (I’m weaning myself off now... thanks COVID, and an overload of cocaine and MDMA in my 20s), feels like I’m popping too much.

The next day I get a diarrhea which lasted 3 days, through which I didn't have any fever, swollen lymph nodes, headache or muscle pain, none of these symptoms. I knew the diarrhea could be a sign, it made me incredibly anxious which wasnt of any help. Today I can finally and happily say that I got my degree. 

As of now (10 days after) the diarrhea is completely gone and all I have is an unsettling feeling in some parts of my body, an almost warm tingling sensation that I can remember feeling when I have had the flu or other weakening illnesses. No sore throat, no swollen lymph nodes, no fever, no cough, no rashes, and no muscle pain.

I've had a constant anxiety that my temperature is rising or that my lymph nodes are swelling while they are not. The anxiety sucks and I will test myself this friday. But it would be very very helpful if the timeline was throughly described by someone who experienced seroconversion.

I know being hiv positive is not the end of the world, but this was my time to be happy, relaxed and accomplished but the anxiety has destroyed any kind of joy I could have had.

I just watched all 5 episodes of ['It's a sin'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltoWiLj_aIk&amp;t=77s) a new gay drama that focuses on some late teen/ early 20-something gays/queers navigating their lives and sexuality in 1980s London, as HIV/AIDS begins to spread through the LGBT community. The show was written by Russell T Davies (writer of Queer as Folk &amp; cucumber), so if you do decide to watch you're in good hands. 

The drama works so well because it doesn't paint this period with one shade of doom, death and gloom, but rather takes a deep dive into the varying attitudes of those who lived through it and those who unfortunately couldn't. From denial to conspiracy, activism, and campaigning. We watch how the nuanced characters try to manage their romantic/sexual desires and a lingering fear that echos louder and louder as the narrative develops. It's packed with hedonism, pain, laughter, lust, tears and 80s music staples!

As a 23(m) I believe I live in a time where we are *somewhat* over the hurdle in terms of HIV/AID- what I mean is it no longer being a complete death sentence (I acknowledge there is a lot of work to still do). Obviously, I don't know what this time was really like, but what was highlighted to me was 'people ACTUALLY  lived through this'! Silly I know. It just made it seem less distant and removed...Like these people lived, loved, fought, danced whatever it might be and some died very young maybe alone  ...leaving families, friends, lovers etcetera. And kinda made me realise the rate at which this was happening- friend groups shrinking and the lack of action taken from leaders. However, as frank and tragic the drama is it’s also a celebration of life. The lives lived and forgotten, a generation of queers wiped out 

Well, those are my 2 pence. Sorry it's not a question but didn't know where else to share. I know it's available on Channel 4 in the UK and I think HBO MAX in the US and I'll assume in other countries too.

However, as frank and tragic as the drama is, it’s also a celebration of life! The lives lived, lost and forgotten of a generation that was decimated by prejudice, fear and illness.

At least, of course. They believe those thresholds are the minimum to be met for stopping HIV eventually.

I looked up the numbers for Germany and the latest ones from 2019 are 88-96-96. This looks pretty good, although not enough people are getting tested for HIV. It was harder to find US rates (beyond the first google page anyway) - in 2016 they were:  86-74-83. There were more recent numbers available from selected cities, e.g. New York meeting all 3 thresholds IIRC, but I'm more interested in national rates - anybody knows them by chance?

l48sk8,Why would people with underlying health problems take longer to get a conclusive result from a hiv test? What does that mean for seroconversion?,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/l48sk8/why_would_people_with_underlying_health_problems/,hopefullyhopeful22,1,1/24/2021 14:02,0,/r/askgaybros/comments/l48sk8/why_would_people_with_underlying_health_problems/,ELI5,"Hello all, please not to much misjudgment here...

Had a pretty scary experience where I got blacked out drunk and came back to conscious in a freakin bathhouse, as you can imagine my mind has been racing, I don’t know what happened or how I got there. In my shame I missed the window period to get pep and it has taken me a lot of courage to even speak about this experience.

Fast forward, I have taken the p24 antigen and antibody rapid test at 4 weeks and a couple oraquicks now at 11 weeks. All came back negative, but research keeps me worried. 

I know I’m not at the official 12 week benchmark for conclusive testing but very close to that goal. But here’s what I’m wondering, I am diagnosed with ibs and fatty liver disease (reason why I had to stop taking prep for my liver to heal and yet I drank into a stupor...so yeah I’m not the best at my health). I have also been seeing a rheumatologist to figure other underlying health problems because I have been sick a lot over the years with body aches and joints.

These thoughts have been infiltrating my mind where I imagine I was gangbanged for all I know, anxiety is killing me, I am usually a top but had been exploring bottoming safely and just thinking about being drunk around poppers and men with no inhibitions scares me. No matter what I am not that sexual active and always practice safe sex so I’d like to think I would keep some standards. I remember briefly fingering someone while giving and getting a blowjob and then having a 2 second conversation with someone about me wearing socks and underwear in this place. It was all so weird and those are the only things I could remember before finally coming to realizing where I was and jetting the eff out of there. 

It feels good to finally talk about, I hope people can forgive my stupid mistakes, I’ve been dealing with a lot of self doubt lately, don’t even see myself properly in the mirror. 

Going on to the question that will help me find some peace, I’ve tested negative now at 11 weeks (yes most have been oraquick which I know isn’t the best) but could have underlying medical situations that may prolong the test. 
So why does that happen? Wouldn’t weaker immune systems create antibodies faster? How about antigens? And how would this affect seroconversion? Would the ars be even more severe? 

As far as symptoms I’m only having mouth ulcers and rashes that are not maculopapular but just red. Both rashes and ulcers come and go in their own daily and only last minutes to hours. Doctor said that ars symptoms don’t come and go like that so maybe some sign of relief there. I also have diarrhea but then again I have ibs and have been anxious so I consider that to be connected. 

All in all bros, I messed up and have been regretting it heavily. I am not out so my conversations have been limited. Please understand I know I did wrong and I know hiv is manageable, I also know now of new prep meds that are better on the liver like descovy and if given the chance to be negative will look into them and get on them.

I just need some chit chat , advice, opinions, and some love. 

Sincerely a scared bro."

Anyway I'd really appreciate it if anyone would chat with me a bit, I'm not even sure what I want to ask/talk about, I just feel beyond lonely. 

Also I wanted to rant about how I got it, anyway in the past few months, after a negative resulte in September, I had 2 sexual partners, I was a bottom with both, anyway, with both I used protection, so I have no idea what happened, either the condom broke and the guy didn't tell me or one of them intentionally gave me hiv. Anyway I feel like it was ment to happen because of how much I was paranoid about it, like I was really batshit crazy paranoid, and to have it happen in such a way, I feel like I jinxed myself or something. 

A guy I went on a date last year told me that I was calling for stuff like this to happen, cause of my paranoia, I told him how scared I was about hiv and other std's after he told me that he goes to orgies all the time. And now I'm kinda haunted by those words. 

Anyway thank you guys, and sorry for the wall of text"

rs4804803(A;A)
 
The SNP rs4804803 is a variant (-336A&gt;G) in the promoter region for the CD209 gene that results in altered CD209 transcription. It is associated with modified resistance to several infectious diseases, including viruses (Hepatitis C, HIV, dengue, SARS), and bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis), as well as other disorders of varying etiology (ulcerative colitis). The CD209 gene encodes a transmembrane receptor found on the surface of dendritic cells and macrophages. The protein product of CD209, DC-SIGN, plays an important role within both the innate and adaptive immune systems. DC-SIGN's role differs depending on which cell type it resides. On macrophages, DC-SIGN is responsible for recognizing and binding to mannose-type carbohydrates, which are found in almost all pathogenic organisms (viruses, bacteria, fungi, etc.) but not human cells; this binding induces phagocytosis of the offending pathogen by the macrophage...

My only protection is that I take prep and despite my fantasy can't bring myself to stop.

I also would nicely ask these guys to not cum in me but might beg for it in the heat of the action.

Is this a risk worth taking for a pleasurable night and a hot porn video?

I am 19 and had plenty of girlfriends in the past.

I've been battling porn addiction and regular porn just wouldn't do it anymore for me. I started watching a bunch of different porn categories, including gay blowjobs. Whenever I got horny, I would reach for porn, different type of fetishes in straight porn ( like foot fetish which I didn't have before porn addiction ) and gay porn.

My friend came over 2 months ago. He turned on porn and one thing led to another and we gave each other handjobs and blowjobs.

This made me sure that I am not gay. It wasnt a bad experience, but I regretted it immediately after I came and post-nut clarity came in. I realized I only did it because of being super horny due to watching porn and being a teen + having 0 contact with other people and 0 relationships and being lonely for 13 months since my last big breakup.

I just regret it so much. I shouldn't have done it. But, one thing that bothers me more is HIV. Could I have gotten it from giving and recieving a blowjob? I asked him before we had oral, and he told me he never had any type of sex with another person before this. I wouldn't be surprised, as he isn't the most charming or hot guy and he claims he is straight ( this was just experimenting for him ) and he can't pull girls easily. I also never had sex before.

Should I worry about getting HIV? I am not worrying about other STDs because even if I get them, I can cure them. I am worried about HIV so much though. I can't even sleep properly. My mouth didnt bleed and neither did his penis. I wish I could get back in time and never do that."

Sharing an org called Mistr which provides free STD testing and PrEP for residents in over 30 states. If you don't know, PrEP stands for ""Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis"" - it's medication that works to prevent HIV, if you plan to have unsafe sex. You have to take it regularly for it to work because it has to build up in your system, but it is a total miracle and saves so many lives. They're able to provide it for free because DHEC (the state health department) got a huge grant for this from the federal government, and it's something you should absolutely take advantage of. If you're regularly engaging in unsafe/condom-less sex or having sex with multiple partners this can support you in preventing HIV, however it does not protect you from Other STI’s.

Being a bottom is not always easy, you need to work on your body to be seen as attractive all the time, you need to douche to avoid embarrassing moments, all this preparation,...

But mostly, I am wondering if fear of HIV may affect in some way my sexuality (even if I’m not meeting anyone now because of covid and I’ve not had as many partners as gay people my age usually do). 

Of course wearing a condom or asking your occasional partner to wear one is not a big deal (unless your partner, top or bottom, pressures you to have sex without one pretending he is on Prep + I must confess I am sometimes clumsy when I am a top and I have to put one ahah), but having sex with this virus luring around is kind of stressful to me. Like when you start to be sexually active first things you learn about sex is PREP and not to trust anyone on this matter. Sexuality should be about spontaneity and fun, not about fear. Sometimes it could even be dangerous specially if you have little experience : partners trying to persuade you to have bareback sex, people lying about their status, saying they’re on Prep while they’re not, ... and sometimes when you’re horny you tend to be reckless (I don’t because 10 minutes of bareback fun with a stranger isn’t worth a lifetime treatment).

Just think it’s kind of sad that death and love are so entwined here and that there is always this little voice in your head. Now I’m not saying
I’m paranoid  ahah just sharing my stupid thoughts.

Of course you don’t die of AIDS anymore and I thank God the stigma is not there anymore (in the 80´s people used to think they would catch HIV just by shaking hand)."

I usually ask where he is from, if he had unprotected sex before, if he meet with a lot of people. but people can sense you are checking if they clean and will lie at this question. so I thought about asking them if they want to have unprotected sex(even though I don't want to have unprotected sex) and then I will know if they protect themselves but if they protect themselves I can lose them by asking this.

It's day 14 of exposure and my mind is just killing me while I wait to get tested.

Here's what my OCD and anxiety is doing to me:

I can barely get out of bed now, my thoughts are racing. I'm imagining worst case scenarios day in and day out.
I can feel the warmth in my stomach, kind of nervousness all day.
Can't focus on anything, I'm forgetting where I put my stuff.
Taking my temperature three times a day. (98F)
Checking my throat for any redness.
Obsessing about any minor pimples that occurs on my body thinking it's hiv rash
I'm just too miserable right now.
Nothing matters anymore, all I think about is what I have done, too much regret, too much anxiety about my test.

Please tell me how I can manage my anxiety? I'm in desperate need. I'm also seeing a therapist but still I'm like this. I know for some people it might not be a big deal but it is for me. I'm a hypochondriac person so you can imagine how much I obsess about any illness."

However, I just got fucked in the ass for the first time. I told him beforehand that I wanted him to use a condom.

He’s an older guy. Probably around 60. And the way he transitioned from rimming to penetrating without skipping a beat makes me think that condoms never occur to him. So he definitely has diseases right?

What are the chances he gave them to me? What’s the best way to clean myself now? What should I do now? I imagine every std takes time to be detectable. Do I just wait a while to get tested?

On January 31st I had my first experience with a trans woman. She’s a local prostitute and I found her ad online. We exchanged oral, and then proceeded to protected anal sex with a condom. I was the bottom and as far as I know the condom was used correctly and did not break. She was covered the whole time inside me and she never came. 

On 2/20 (approximately 3 weeks after the encounter) I started to get night sweats accompanied by chills and a mild fever. No cough or sore throat, no rash, ulcers or any other symptoms displayed besides the fever/chills/night sweats. During the day I feel pretty normal
for the most part, but in the evening the symptoms are more noticeable. Today is 2/26 so it’s almost been a week and I think I’m starting to feel better. I’m just really concerned I may have contracted HIV because the timing and nature of my symptoms are in line with the acute infection phase for HIV. 

I’d like to add that I intend to get tested, just waiting because I heard it can take up to 3 months for the antibodies to show up on a test. I got a COVID test and it came back negative so I’m really starting to freak out. Even though we used a condom, should I have any reason to be concerned or am I just psyching myself out? 

I cannot confirm her status, although she claims to be negative and is tested regularly. I’m not looking for comments to make me feel better, I just want honest opinions. Any and all feedback is greatly appreciated.

Thanks gay bros

Edit: I expressed my concerns with the trans prostitute and she was quite offended, but I finally got her to send me a picture of her most recent test results as of 12/18 and she was negative. Thanks to everyone who commented and offered their perspective. I will still get tested but I think I’m in the clear."

Last Thursday I downloaded for the first time and met up with a guy from Grindr - he gave me head and then I told to him to put it in my arse(**wanted to see if I enjoyed it**), he pumped for around a minute but then I asked him to pull out as it hurt and was not enjoyable at all. As he was wanking and giving me head, I noticed a weird black scab on his left hand but I didn't think too much of it at the time. I didn't cum in his mouth but he got me off and I came on his face.

Last Sunday I began experiencing **really bad flu like symptoms;** I have experienced a painful tingling all over my body like there are needles stabbing me constantly, no cough but a sore throat however it isn't as bad right now, don't have a headache unless I start stressing over the whole situation, and a really high temperature. Also I have been vacillating from feeling really hot and really cold (when I'm cold I have been shivering uncontrollably).

On Monday (**when the pain became unbearable**) spoke to the NHS 111 service, and they told me to order a coronavirus kit and head straight to A and E (the hospital). At the hospital the first doctor thought that the symptoms I experienced could be covid-19 but he wasn't sure. On Tuesday, the test arrives and I send it back after doing the necessary swabs. **This may sound strange but I wanted it to be covid-19 so badly**, however, on Wednesday, I receive a text message saying that I had tested negative for covid-19. **Today,** I woke up feeling like absolute shite, so I  head to the A and e and after getting seen by another doctor , he said to be sure, they were going to take my blood to test for HIV/Hepatitis C.

Right now, I'm absolutely bricking it, the first time I hook up with a guy I could end up with HIV has me absolutely distraught. I should have used protection and was an absolute fool not to. None of my best mates know I'm out and we all live together. Hard to go about day to day when I have this massive thing hanging over me. None of my family know i'm out, and to add the possibility of having HIV is just too much to think about has me very very scared right now.

Really just like to talk to someone because I don't have anyone to reassure me or talk to. Does his scab indicate anything ? **Also Will update you guys when I call my GP  tomorrow asking about my results**."

He was trying to get inside without a condom, until I stopped him and made him put one on (to which he consistently made comments about how it “didn’t feel good” and that he “wouldn’t cum with one” or it “hurt”). He was never fully inside without a condom. Afterwards during oral he told me he was undetectable. 

I just met him yesterday and feel like the way the whole thing unfolded was uncomfortable. He said he was undetectable, and when I asked him to confirm this afterwards so I wasn’t anxious he got really defensive and told me he didn’t have access to his records, and that he didn’t really want to continue talking to me. I feel terrible because I know U=U and I don’t want to sound accusatory but I only just met him yesterday and can’t totally trust his word? And the way he handled me asking to talk about it was a major red flag.

I got on PEP this morning because I couldn’t handle the anxiety. It would have been about 20 hours after exposure, and we mostly used a condom, but I’m still anxious as hell. Do you think I handled this wrong with him? I didn’t think it was super unreasonable to ask him to confirm his undetectable result, but now that he got upset I’m worried he was lying or hiding something— which just makes me more anxious. Any advice or ways I can handle this better in the future ?"

I’ve only ever had one sexual experience with a guy around 14 months ago. Going to get a lil be specific, no anal, just oral. He sucked me for like 10 mins (came in his mouth) and I (tried) to suck his flaccid dick for maybe a minute until I gave up and quit. 

I have never done anything sexual with another person since then. Literally not a single thing.

I have been getting lab work done the past few months and my doctor says there’s a abnormal about of lymphocytes. I looked it up and that can be sign of an ongoing infection. HIV was on that list of possible illnesses.

I did some googling and apparently you can have HIV for 8-10 years untreated. 

I might be out of my mind but I’m starting to kind of hyperventilate. Can anyone explain the situation better? What was your experience? Any information is appreciated.

So I just got diagnosed with HIV a couple of days ago at 21 yo, already started medications and everything seem good. I am not really concerned about my health. I'm pretty healthy and in shape. Taking a pill a day is as much as taking vitamins or other supplements (okay maybe the only difference is that skipping a day or two puts my life in danger lol). And I'm grateful to have contracted it in a country where I can afford and access the medication and at a time when the medication allows me to live a pretty normal life -- I could have have it worse.

However, I'm very concerned abt my dating life from now. Well to start with, I never really had a dating life tbf lol. I never dated anyone before. It's weird because I've been told all my life (not to brag I just want to give context haha) that I'm cute and really good looking. I try to put myself out there as much as possible, but it seems I still haven't really hit in any guy's eyes unfortunately. Even when it comes to hook ups, I've been struggling quite a lot lol (yet here I am today ig...). I was wondering how dating is like when hiv+? Ig it must be harder, but how hard is it really? The social stigma actually scares me, and I feel like simply shutting myself down for fear of rejections upon rejections. 

I'm also very disappointed as I actually started seeing a guy whom I really like. He could've been my first ever boyfriend, but I still haven't completely accepted the fact that I'm hiv+ myself and can't see myself telling him yet. But I do not want to continue seeing him and go any further without telling him because he might be really disappointed and might make things more complicated when he finds out. Any advice? Would any negative guys out here date hiv+ guys? I know there's a discussion on that but it's pretty depressing and also outdated and I want to feel like there's still hope for me. Tbh I sometimes feel like it's useless to think I'll find anyone in the next five years now that I'm positive. 

I also find it funny when doctors say I can have a completely  normal sex life (even without condoms) once I'm undetectable, but the question for me is not whether or not I want, but if other will want?"

In between my two hiv rapid tests, i had 3 unprotected sexual partners: One was recently tested negative for HIV, One had a sexual encounter with me because they were curious and it was after he got tested, The third one was on PREP and showed results. 
I am very nervous about the possibility of me catching HIV or ending up being positive for it. 
ANOTHER THING , the person who gave them my contact info would obviously be on my contact list as well. The thing is i haven’t met up with anyone that has my phone number in the 3 months which is the incubation period for HIV

My positive partner, who I am no longer with, is very private of her status and specifically asked me not to share her status with my other partner. After learning about u=u and determining there was zero chance of transmission I decided to respect her wishes.

However, last night, it got a bit out of hand. Though all the guys used condoms, I am concerned about one instance. A guy fucked someone (that someone is confirmed undetectable HIV), and then he fucked me. We were all on the same bed, and before he entered, I asked if he put on a new condom. In the heat of the moment, I accepted his confirmation answer, and he went in.

Usually, if I don’t see it happen, I don’t go for it. Always usually need my own confirmation for condom. I mean, it’s entirely possible he wasn’t lying, but there’s also the chance he was lying. There was probably about a five minute gap between when he was with the other bottom and then with me.

Considering the other bottom was undetectable HIV-positive, what are the chances of my risk if that top was lying and was using the same condom? Or for exampme in another more general situation, let’s say someone fingered someone with HIV and then fingered someone else with the same finger, how risky would that be?

Currently, it’s been 20 hours or so since the experience. Finding it difficult to weigh my risk factor right now. Not on PrEP. Don’t really want to get PEP because I’m really busy right now, but I obviously can if the risk factor is high enough... If this isn’t the right sub, sorry."

Hellos all. I’ve been searching on this subreddit and Google-alike, and I know the risks of getting HIV is very low from giving oral sex.

He did not cum in my mouth (I don’t know if he pre-cummed), but he made me rim him as well.

I never had sex or anything (am still a virgin) so the fact I feel sick after this oral experience got me real worried.

He told me he was clean (but I’m really still worried) - but I had feelings of soreness in my throat days after. It isn’t like a complete sore throat just that lingering feeling it is sore, if you get what I mean? It doesn’t hurt when I swallow saliva. Fast forward to today, I have skin rashes just below my left shoulder blade. I just searched and one of HIV’s symptoms include skin rashes. But it didn’t look like that but rather of insect bites that is very itchy. It is huge raised bumps as compared to the small blister-like symptoms.

And my doc said that i should came back a month after which is april 17 for future confirmatory testing with more sensitive test . So i went crazy while waiting for a month , i begin dealing with anxiety , and feel like im sick all the time , and my heart just racing cant go to sleep nightmares all day .

The test was CMIA , ECLIA , and i can’t remember the third test it came back all negative , the test results was sent to my doctors office and he said its alright youre good , the virus is not there , its been 2 month and the most sensitive test can’t detect it . So i kinda relieved but not fully , u know what i mean , theres still worries with that , So i keep dealing with anxiety until today , and finally last week i got sick , i got a fever , and my joints are aching but it only lasted for 1 day . I woke up the next i was completely fine . But now im dealing with sore throat , finally I went back to my doc he said that ur just too stressed so u get sick easily , i dont know how to cope with these . Maybe if you previously have someone similarly talked about this to you maybe do u have any tips on this . 

Really i want my life back 
Timeline : 
17th february (possible exposure) 
8 march (1st test - rapid )
17 april (cmia , eclia , ) 
All negative .

Is there any chance that my hiv test change in the third month ? Or im just having really bad anxiety?"

Long story short, I (F) had unprotected sex with my now boyfriend who told me after that he has never been tested for STDs and dated a sex worker 2 years ago. Other than that, he's been sexually active with only his past girlfriends. I freaked out and immediately went to the minuteclinic where the nurse practitioner listened to my story and prescribed me pep. She agreed it'd be a good idea since we don't know his sexual health status. Then I had my boyfriend go get tested at a hospital and he came back negative for all STDs (showed me proof). At this point, I was on day 3 of my PEP. I stopped taking it because I felt like there was no point.

I know I could be overthinking it but can PEP (Truvada and Trivicay) give you the virus even if you didn't have it before? For example, can the medication raise my antibodies that were in my body from the past? I only ask because I had unprotected intercourse with a bisexual guy who had sex with both men and women 4 years ago. I've tested negative many times since. 

I'll get tested for. my own piece of mind but HIV anxiety is one of the worst physical and mental pain I have ever gone through in my life."

Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

On the 30th of March, I had unprotected oral sex without ejaculation with a male partner of unknown HIV status (both given and received). There was no ejaculation in the mouth involved. I have good dental health overall and believe that I had no cuts, sores during the encounter and definitely no bleeding gums.

I had no other sexual contact of any kind since then. I tested negative for Gonorrhoea, Chlamydia, Syphilis and HIV.

&amp;#x200B;

I have tested a couple of times during the past week using 4th generation tests: HIV 1 Ag and HIV 1 &amp; 2 Total Abs. The sample was blood from the vein and processed by a lab.

\- 5th April (5 full days post-encounter): Negative

\- 16th April (16 full days post-encounter): Negative

\- 28th April (28 full days post-encounter): Negative

&amp;#x200B;

I am aware that the tests on the 5th and 16th of April were rather useless, but I did them anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Please note that I still get tested routinely every 3 months, but my next test is on the 3rd of August, which is quite a bit far away.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been worried and anxious about HIV, do I need to be? Do I require any further testing to absolve myself from this specific encounter?

&amp;#x200B;

TIA!"

Though I'll have my answers in a few days, I'm writing this mostly out of severe anxiety and desperation.

I've (22M) had two sexual encounters about a month ago. They were one week apart. The first one, I bottomed, it was fully protected, and I only gave unprotected oral sex for about 10 secs (he did not cum). The second one, I bottomed with protection again, but this time I swallowed his cum (and I'm worried about bleeding cuts from brushing about 2 hours before that).

Two weeks after the second encounter (and riskier, I guess), I developed the most severe headache that pounded my headache and eyes. I couldn't move or touch my eyes for 5 days. I also developed a red rash (neither painful nor itchy) on my stomach and slightly on my chest. Both symptoms were discussed with my dermatologist/venereologist and were diagnosed as allergic/seasonal skin reaction and poor posture/eye strain headache, which I found to be plausible. I started taking Aerius for my skin rash.

Then I read online about those symptoms being potentially from HIV, and started panicking. Increased heartbeat and poor sleep. I started developing night sweats (4 nights in total, at random nights with no other symptoms overlapping), became feverish (about 37 something, never exceeded 38), developed dry mouth and oral thrush and slightly swollen lymph nodes (2 i think, not in pairs and barely visible). I also have very very dry and bloody boogers and even 3-4 nose bleeds. Some of these are highly associated with anxiety (which i definitely suffer from) and Aerius (as an antihistamine) even has some side effects like dry mouth (which can result in oral thrush) but Im still highly paranoid and anxious. I'm getting very dark thoughts.

I'm in constant communication with both sexual encounters, Both of them assure me that 1) our sex wasn't risky at all (though I'm still anxious about swallowing), that 2) they get tested frequently and had never developed any symptoms and that 3) there's absolutely no reason to worry about getting HIV from them. They didn't even seem stressed out about it, only for my potential health issues and mental state. 

I'm getting tested tomorrow, and I'll have my results by Monday. I hope I can come back to this thread on Monday and announce my negative results (I'm doing the 4th gen HIV test). Fingers crossed."

I've read so many conflicting things online. Can anybody help me make some sense of it all.

So to start out I had a low risk MSM experience. Only msm experience I've ever had. It involved mutual masturbation, and anal fingering with his precum. I was mostly scared because I thought some anal fissure I had were healed but they may not have been. He said he was clean but I know thats not reliable, and now I cant find him anywhere.

So a week after exposure I started experiencing some symptoms. I'm hoping just psychosomatic. I had some pretty severe anxiety. But my symptoms were a cough, sore throat, thrush, muscle, and joint aches, night sweats, and lethargy. I never had a fever or at least not a high enough one for me to notice.

So I got tested for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and tri a week after all negative.

Then I got tested for HIV with 4th gen and covid two weeks after. Both negative.

HIV fourth gen test at 26 and 37 days nonreactive.

HIV fourth gen and syphilis test 45 days after both negative.

Ive seen conflicting window periods for HIV. Some say four weeks, some say six, and some say 90 days is the only certain. I went on [askexpertsnow.com](https://askexpertsnow.com/) and they all say 6 weeks is conclusive. But I'm not sure how reliable their website is. I'm still worried I may have HIV, and I'm still a few weeks away from 90 days. Can anyone offer any advice one way or the other. I know I need to be on prep, and in the future I will be. Thanks."

The only time when my body came in contact with his sperm was the time when I tried to suck him for less than a minute. However, before I arrived at his place, I had bitten my lip, which caused a really small cut in it. It had probably healed before the moment I put his penis in my mouth. I tasted some salty precum, so now I'm slightly anxious about the possibility of it entering my bloodstream through this (?) micro wound in my lip. 
The only moment when he penetrated me was once when he put his penis (with a condom on) into my anus. He immediately stopped after I had felt pain.

My question is - is it likely at all that I may have contracted something?"

Today my fever has subsided but my throat is hurting again. I've felt weak and fatigued the entire time and had a lack of appetite. I also had one instance of diarrhea. 

Symptoms aside, I've done extensive HIV reading so I decided to get tested for the flu, covid, and strep. All tested negative. The doctor also tested my CD4 cell count and it's normal. However, she diagnosed me with a low grade fever of unknown origin. This concerns me because I've never had an illness like this before (especially that couldn't be diagnosed). My symptoms seem mild and I only had the severe ones (fever and chills) for about 12-18 hours.

Lately I’ve been having a lot of anxiety about catching HIV from my previous sexual partners. I’ve been having a sore throat this week and two weeks before. That was the only symptom though. Honestly, I was thinking it could have been stress-related due to my exams coming up and also the anxiety of getting HIV. still, i needed to know for sure though. I always check with my sexual partners to see if they are on PREP medication. Since my last STD test which was two months ago, I have had about 3 sexual partners(all were unprotected but two of them were on PREP) I was negative from the last test but I still had the same anxiety every time after a sexual encounter. The one guy that was not on prep medication was negative and told me he routinely tests for STDs and is friend of mine so I KINDA? trust him. I am for sure going to get tested on monday but I just want to know the chances of potentially getting HIV from the encounters."

This guy told me after he had an extremely promiscuous sex life with no protection at all (i am a trans girl), he had sex with a girl the day before without condom and he told me he had Gonorrhea one year before the encounter.

Some say oral sex is not dangerous for HIV but when i brush my teeth i bleed on my gums and i think i did brush them before meeting him, so the risk is there.

After meeting him (2 weeks after) i started to feel unwell and thought it was covid, got tested for covid and nothing, got tested for STDs 21 days after and nothing.

The lymph nodes of my neck got swollen, then my armpits and even today (after 9 months) they are still swollen (moderately swollen, but an echography said they are reactive). I had slight symptoms of acute HIV symptoms, but very very light ones, it could even be hypochondria, i dont know anymore. I had muscle sores, night sweats, even my tongue got yellow for no reason, but all ended suddenly.

Got tested 3 times, one at 21 days, at 2 months and a half and at 5 months... All negative. I think the tests are antibodies and antigens.

The guy i met got tested and he says he was negative, but i asked them to show me the results and he said no. His ex gf (who contacted me after all this situation) also got negative. What scares me about this is that this guy suddenly deleted all his social media out of the blue... He is an extremely weird person, wish i knew him better before that night. Also the encounter with him was really bad, he kind of pressured me to do things i didnt want to and said he wouldnt call me again if i didnt do them.

I had no fever, i feel perfectly now, had nothing very extreme as a symptom. The only thing that scares me is the swollen lymph nodes for 9 months in a row, they got swollen exactly after meeting him, 2 weeks after.

Doctors said that im just an hypochondriac and treated me like if i was just annoying. The treatment also was really bad, one doctor said in a phone call after telling my symptoms it was definitively HIV, other one didnt wanna attend me (its public healthcare where i live), and other one treated me like if he was scolding a child on his consult. 

They didn't give me any calm about this topic, they never confirm anything, or say when a test is conclusive, they just go for the book definition, say at 6th month is definitive and thats all. I did my last test at 5th month and the doctor asked me if i wanted to stop testing, because he thought i was clean, or not. But i think it should be him who decides if i keep testing or not.

I am super paranoid, probably is hypochondria, but i just can not comprehend how my lymph nodes are still swollen when i oficially had no illness in all this proccess. I had breast augment in september 2020, but my nodes only swole after meeting the guy."

Nonetheless because I felt I got carried away I asked him his HIV condition. This is where things got awkward.

The guy completely changed, got really aggressive saying HIV did not exist, how could I be so stupid, this was like COVID a big hoax. He said that he knows he cannot catch HIV, his body is very strong, and that he was not gonna get it. This carried on for a while. The guy never said 'I am negative' so this is when i became to be scared. I made the mistake of not taking PEP straigth after. since this was three weeks ago, I decided to ask him again yesterday.

I asked him to be careful and he put his cock between my thighs and came there.

For context, on April 14, I met up with this guy at his hotel on a whim because he was leaving town the next day. We just kissed and stuff and then I jerked him off, then we showered together. 

12 days later, on the 26th, I got a fever and chills. Over the course of the following week, I also developed night sweats, white tongue, upset stomach, and for like 3-4 days, a mild rash on my torso and neck (it was just a little red and itchy, but not enough for me to actually feel like I had to scratch it). I went to my campus doctor numerous times throughout this. Tested negative for COVID, strep, flu, everything. My doctor assured all of this was normal and I had no reason to worry, it’s just a regular random virus. 

But heres why I AM so worried. When me and the guy were together, I remember him stopping while he was kissing me/on top of me and asking if I was okay. At first I was kind of confused. Then he said it was because I was bleeding. I looked down and saw there was some blood on my stomach. 

I don’t remember exactly what happened right then but I know I’m not an idiot so I definitely stopped to clean myself off first. But the weird thing is, I couldn’t find the cut anywhere. There was no cut on my stomach and I didn’t have blood anywhere else or have anything that hurt. I thought it might be a cut on my back (I remember he scratched my back at one point, and then there was blood on the bed when I got up from where I was laying, so I’m thinking I might have been bleeding on my back and gotten it on my stomach when I turned over? Idk) but I don’t know if I checked there or saw anything. Anyway, after that, he came on my chest, and then we cleaned off in the shower. 

Now I’m worried because I heard HIV can spread through an open cut. But the thing is, I’m not sure I even had an open cut, and if I did, idk if his semen came in contact with it. Plus, I don’t even know if the guy is HIV positive in the first place (and there’s no way for me to get in contact with him anymore - don’t have his number). 

My doctor also said not to worry because I took a blood test on the 30th and it came back negative. But when I asked her, she said it adequately measures HIV up to 3 weeks before the test - but I was with the guy only 16 days earlier! So now I’m going to get a blood test at my physical at home on June 1, and they say it should be able to detect HIV as long as it’s 45 days after the encounter (which would work). 

Anyway I’ve just been stressed out a lot about this because my virus came 12 days after the encounter, and I read that the first symptoms usually come 2-4 weeks later, so it’s really close. Do you think I have worry about this or am I freaking myself out for nothing? Is it possible I got HIV if I had a cut? I’m going to be so upset if I do have HIV because I’ve been safe and never done anything high risk. Also I’m so worried about how medication will work if I do test positive, and how I will afford it/be able to get it without my parents finding out (they’d freak). 

I guess I’m just looking for some advice about this. And maybe needed to vent a little too. Sorry for typing so much, I just have really anxiety, and because of this, for the past month, my anxiety has never been worse."

This week he got tested and sent me a pic of the result, negative. But im worried anyways. Two days after we had sex I started to feel flu sympthoms: fever, headache, sore throat, some diarrea, loss of taste.

Or maybe these were covid sympthoms, the loss of taste were suspicious. I already had a quick covid test and it was negative, but it may be a false negative so I'm gonna do it again too.

I was told HIV sympthoms wouldnt appear so early, that it takes two weeks at least. But I'm worried anywas and want to get tested as soon as possible. The symphoms lasted only two-three days and I'm feeling 100% now. Could it be other STD?"

Feeling kinda hopeless seeing as I’ve never had a fever last this long, and the “usual” post-exposure fever lasts one to two weeks so that would check out. And I have no other symptoms, not even a sore throat really. 

I really thought I was being careful, I’m 20 years old and was apprehensive to start having sex until last year when I moved into my university apartment. Once I did, I used a condom each time. Mostly I was the penetrator and only once did I bottom. And only one time did I get semen in my mouth. All that paired with the fact that nearly all of these guys claimed they weren’t too sexually experienced with males. So I know that my odds of a HIV infection should be rather slim, but I can’t explain what’s going on. It’s been 3 weeks since I got back here and had 4 sexual experiences. So the timing is fairly suspicious. I’ve had a reoccurring temperature of 38°-39.5° that I can only bring down for a couple of hours with ibuprofen, but it’s been 5 days and it’s still coming back. Got covid tested and it was negative, so at this point I’m hoping this is oral gonorrhea or just a regular fever (which is unlikely considering how long it’s been lasting.)

I’m getting an HIV test in a few days, to make it a 4 week gap between the enounter I find the most suspicious, and then I have to go back home to my small hometown that doesn’t have an HIV testing clinic nearby, and I can’t discreetly travel to get to one either during the summer (I still don’t own my own car) so I’ll have to wait until late September or October to get tested again. Bleh. I don’t see myself as an irrational person but I’m just so scared and frustrated. (So please be nice because I’m feeling bad enough already🤕).

I was diagnosed maybe a month ago. I have started meds so hopefully that's working ? However, I have gotten more and more depressed over time. I feel so lonely, I keep thinking about hiv every single moment of my life to the point where I don't enjoy doing anything any more ...I wake up multiple times at night thinking about it... When in with friends I just keep thinking how perfect their lives are HIV free and how mine is fucked..

 I would love to just make some friends especially if they are HIV + and around 20-29 ( around my age ), but anyone is welcomed. 

I have some friends but non of them know. Only a guy I had been cuddling/ messing around with , which I got feelings for , knows - but obviously he doesn't really want anything to do with me anymore. I get it, but it's sad to see he hasn't even met with me in person to talk. 

I'm just so so sad, so I would love to hear from ppl going that are going through similar situations... As sad as this sounds, I just need s friend. 

I'm in Utah...."

We met on Grindr, firstly because we are both interested in dogs and we went for a walk with my dog and talked. We talked and walked more and more and hang out more watching TV, going to places, and having (protected sex) sometimes.

Anyway, my feelings for him developed over time and he loves my dog. He has a fledgling dog business and I was going to go into business with him potentially, and potentially be his boyfriend depending on how things continue to develop.

Anyway, I told him something like “I’m starting to fall in love with you” on one of our walks. The next day he said “I have something to tell you, I am hiv positive”. I asked him all about it, and his meds etc. 

Now I am not interested in him sexually, call it discriminatory, but I have no attraction to him now whatsoever. Having sex with him is not appealing to me now no matter how low my chances of getting hiv. I do not know how to handle it without being nasty. 

I would love to still be friends, but we often used to kiss on our walks and touch each other and I am not interested now.

Saturday night I hooked up with a guy. We mostly did oral but he did rub his dick around my ass. There was no real penetration but it was close and I’m sure there was precum.

Realistically, I know the risk is low. I’ve only hooked up with a few guys in my life and have never had unprotected sex. But I need to put my mind at ease and I know it’s way too soon to be tested. Would it be in bad taste to ask his status? Obviously, there are plenty of other STDs to worry about — I don’t want to ask for his entire health history.

I’m not on prep (yes I know I should be) but of course it’s too late for that now. And I know PEP is still an option but I’m not sure if I would even qualify since there was no penetration.

I read that some sources say that symptoms appear after a week or 2 but some also say it can take a few days so I'm pretty anxious.

I had unprotected sex (top) with a guy. It lasted a couple of minutes but I didn't finish inside him. The day after the hookup I felt my throat was a bit weird (as if it was gonna get sore the next day) and it was, indeed. The second day my throat was sore, felt fatigued, and could feel my temperature go up until I went to sleep. I also developed a small rash (?) in my pubic area. It's colorless and it itches/pricks sometimes. I'd like to think it's heat rash but the timing is so bad it's scary.

This was the third day now and I don't have fever, but my throat is still sore and an elbow joint feels a bit sore. I slept for like 5 hours and thought I still had fatigue later in the day but I took a nap and it was gone, and I don't have rashes anywhere else I think. 

I tried making calls to get PEP on the third day but the thought of going to ER while uninsured scared me. No community resources were available either.

My last encounter besides that guy was 2 weeks ago and it was only a BJ. Is the possibility of having STD symptoms from that encounter still open?

What's more ironic is that I was scheduled to get tested a day after having sex with the last guy, too. Of course if I get infected from that encounter it won't show it because of the time window, but I wanted to know in case I got something from the other guy. Hopefully the time window of 2 weeks is enough to bring accurate results for other STDs.


TL;DR: Can someone get acute HIV symptoms 2 days after sex?"

 I want to alert my partner and to ask him to get tested so that I might know sooner, but don’t wanna freak him out. It’s certainly freakout material. And to make things worse, he has a crippling fear of needles (bad enough that he’s bailed on 1, possibly 2 appointments to get vaccinated against COVID). Any test that requires blood work would freak him out EVEN MORE.  He’s a really nice guy, and was open about having multiple sexual partners. It was on me to ask him to use protection but I pussied out. This is all kinda hellish and I would honestly like to spare him as much grief and stress as possible."

About a week ago I hooked up with my old FWB (hes a 27 male) and so am I. He gave me a blowjob with no protection, we then proceeded to cuddle naked and mutual masturbate eachother, I rubbed my penis on his, and he rubbed his penis on my anus. I don't think he inserted his penis inside me but i cannot remember, if he did put it in it would have been for 10 seconds. He did not ejaculate inside me and I don't know if he had any precum. He told me he recently tested negative as he is now in a relationship (him and his boyfriend are both negative) they are opening to experiment but they haven't done it with anyone yet they only want to with me as I know both of them. When I first met him, he was on prep. Now he's not because he's in a relationship. I'm incredibly anxious, is there any risk of HIV? Even if he inserted his penis in my anus for 10 seconds? He works at a hospital, so he is aware of risks and knows about sexual health, and was previously on prep getting checked every 3 months. Am I being anxious for no reason? My stomach is constantly aching because of how much anxiety I have. Should I be anxious about HIV from this? Especially if he inserted it for a couple of seconds?

I'm wonder if there are anyone on here who could enlighten me on why are black gay men more exposed to the virus? 

Are they not using protection because they are not educated? Is it because of the homoohobia within the community and the stigma attached to homosexuality within said community. Is it because they don't like wearing condoms? 

I'm interested to know why is it a problem within the black community? 

PS: I'm not saying HIV is only a problem within said community and I'm not neglecting or denying other communities suffer from the inflection of the virus. But to me personally, it's where my interest lie.

So I told her the case and then in the heat of the moment she removed my condom and we kept going. After around 20 thrusts without the condom she told me that it was hurting so we continued the rest orally. After 24 hour passed, I became sick and was showing every symptom of hiv. I learned that hiv showed symptoms at least 1 week later the incident so that made me think I caught the cold because of the cold night swims in the pool. Now I am going to get tested but Im waiting for at least 20 days to pass. It has been more than 72 hours so I dont have the pep choice.

After a routine STI test, my results came back positive for MGen (*Mycoplasma Genitalium*, a bacterial STI similar to Gonorrhea but a lot more difficult to treat). It took me 2 months of treatment and (I think) 3 different types antibiotics to treat it. The treatment took a huge toll on my body and overall health.

When I respectfully approached him about it, he admitted he hadn't actually been tested in a while (despite what he had told me), and when he got tested, his test came back positive for MGen (I had tested negative before being with him). I trusted him and took him at his word. I realize mistakes happen and I'm thankful this was treatable. But when I say the treatment took a toll on me, I'm not joking. I'm allergic to several antibiotics, so it took a while to find a course of treatment for me, and even then it took many rounds for it to work. This incident left me kind of questioning if I should just be taking everyone at their word when they tell me they're negative and/or undetectable.

So I wanted to ask: Is it ever okay to ask for proof? If yes, what's the right way to ask? If not, why you do you think so? I legitimately don't know, so I want to be sensitive and respectful about how to do this going forward. Thank you."

a rush of blood to the head later he promises me he's gonna get tested to be sure

Yesterday he left earlier from work because his friday routine is different, and he took the test

It came back positive but undetectable, and the lady who applied the test said he couldn't have passed it forward

We used condoms and apparently it's unlikely to catch it from oral or kissing right? but my gums bleed easily, even when i brush my teeth, so i'm not sure what this means for me 

I'm confused about him being undetectable when he and the guy broke up a year ago and he didn't know so he couldn't have had treatment, did he get lucky? 

And also, where do i go to take this test? we fell off for different reasons so i don't really know

He wasn't really receptive to me asking about what i should do now, i get it it must have been a punch to his gut too, but it's a responsibility nonetheless, this and some other behavior he showed makes me think he might've known of his HIV status before and didn't want to tell me :þ

About 16 days ago i hooked up with an african american chick in a city. According to what i've read, both being in a densely populated city and being black increases someones risk for having HIV. We had unprotected sex about 4 times for a decently long period. I asked her if she had anything, she was able to provide proof of being negative for gonorrhea and chlamdyia on her phone through a portal. 

It was weird though, when i asked her for HIV proof she either couldn't or wouldn't pull it up on her phone. Instead insisting they made her ""sign a release to get tested"" for HIV and that they told her it was negative. She then said she went into the doctors office but because it was only a ""nurse"" they couldn't ""give"" her results and that they told her it was for sure negative. Her last ex was an immigrant, black, and jamaican all of which are increased risk factors for him having HIV.

However the NEXT DAY i was fine and could eat normally (today). When i looked up how long the symptoms last it said typically (for hiv ARS) a ""few"" days to a couple weeks usually. What does a ""few"" days mean? A few means at least 3 or 4 doesn't it?  So mine doesn't match that description either. Could i have just had a 24 hour bug?"

\#2 Frotting with pre cum while one party has cuts on their penis?

\#3 Giving a blowjob where your partners pre cum comes into contact with a cut inside your mouth?

\#4 Receiving a blowjob while you have cuts on your penis?

The reason I ask is because I know normally it's virtually impossible to pass HIV through any of these acts... but... if there are slight cuts involved (not extreme or profuse bleeding) how much does this risk change? Thank you all!"

Before I say anything, I've already booked a test for next Monday. Honestly, at this point, I've tried calming myself down since I have severe anxiety with the usual ""I'd rather live with it than die from it"". So for context, I decided to meet up with a guy from Gindr as I've always been interested in gay sex as a bottom but was always incredibly shy. I spoke with this guy for a while and he invited me over. First mistake was not bringing a condom/asking him to wear a condom. He was gentle and nice with me as he knew it was my first time so he was patient. We kissed, I sucked him and he sucked me, etc etc. We tried penetrative sex however I just really didn't enjoy it so we stopped and complied - no problem. He didn't ejaculate, I didn't either, we went our separate ways.

This was at the very end of February. Skip to June, a lymph node swells in my neck under my jaw. I had it screened and the report by the doctor stated that It was ""most likely benign and reactionary"". Dr asked If I had any sort of headaches/throatproblems/neckproblems/flus/tooth problems. I said no, he said no problem, you're not showing symptoms. Skip to now, I have this weird headache/throbbing pain in my head everytime I stand up or focus on something for too long. it's not painful, but I can feel it. Also, that lymph node has since gone down.

Realistically, what is the chance I've contracted HIV here. I had no cuts around my anus and he had no cuts. None of us ejaculated either. Is this just my anxiety spiraling?"

We met for the first time more than a month after meeting online. We hit it off, and have been seeing each other ever since. We are both closeted, he lives with his family, and I live more than 30kms away. We find time on few weekends and spend the day together.

Months later during one of our frank conversations, he told me had had been with many guys in the past, mainly just sex partners. I told the past is over and let's just focus on the present. In November of 2020, I incidentally found him in contact on FB with another guy, who works at my place. When I asked him about how they knew each other, he honestly told me that they hooked up a few times after meeting on a gay dating app. Worst, he last met him just a couple of months prior, and they had sex.

This rattled me, and I asked him to come meet me immediately, which he did. I couldn't comprehend this situation where he proclaimed his love for me, but had been having flings behind my back. I told him how shocked I was, thanked him for telling the truth rather than lie to me, and if this is what he likes to do, then we should break up because I can't be with someone who wants to be with many guys at once. 

He profusely apologized, and said he would never repeat this ever, and he only wants to be with me. And I forgave him! Things went back to the way they were.

Until recently..He got sick in the April of 2021, and was sick for a long time. We didn't meet during this period, but I was constantly in touch with him, for any help, support or advise I could give. When he got better (not completely healed), he visited me, in June, and we got intimate. I have to mention that though I have done it with him in the past, I am not a big fan of sex, and I always used protection.

Earlier this month too he visited me, we spend the day together, but he was not very keen on getting physical, which he also kind of mentioned before coming over, saying like I'm still sick, we should not do this and that etc..I complied. Before leaving that night, he gave a letter and told me to open it after he left.

In this letter, he tells me that he got tested 10 days ago, and he is HIV positive, and he is sorry that he put me at risk, and wants me to get tested. This turned my world around. One thing I didn't mention so far is that I am a doctor. Suddenly his symptoms from 3 months ago made sense to me. I just never imagined it could be this. Even his treating doctors had misdiagnosed him despite him visiting hospital a multitude of times, and doing a battery of tests.

I'm scared for myself now, I haven't taken the test yet, but have a slot within the next 2 weeks. Meanwhile I was very supportive to him. I asked about his past partners, and he told me that he informed them to take the test. I suspected he got infected from the guy at my workplace, and since he had already admitted and apologized about it, I did not blame him. In fact, I told him that I forgive him even if I got HIV because I knew he did not do it to me on purpose.

However, last Sunday, we were together, and it was also the day the guy from my workplace was taking the test. While we were having dinner, that guy texted him that he was negative. As much as I was happy for that guy, things now just did not fit in. The doctor in me is pretty sure that he got infected in 2021 to show the kind of symptoms he had in April. 

So did he do it again?? I asked him, again, nicely after dinner in my room, whether he had sex with anyone this year, and this is just to clear this all up. I had questioned this much earlier too when he told me of his HIV diagnosis, but he promised me he hadn't been with anyone else, and I believed him.  I told him the timeline doesn't fit and that there has to be a source. This time he admitted to another guy he had been with also tested positive but he denied having any relationship with other after the summer of 2019 (the time when I caught him and forgave him earlier). I told him, the timeline of his infection still doesn't add up, and please be honest with me. And he tells me that even husband and wife keep secrets from each other, and he doesn't want to tell me some things. I told him this affects not just our relationship but my life too. He sticks to his guns, and leaves.

On the way back, he texts me that he is exhausted and that perhaps his death will be a solution to everything. I panicked. I knew he was guilty of wrongdoing, but I was more worried about his emotional status. Fortunately, he got home safe, and I asked him to relax.

I've worked all angles on this. He has acknowledged he is hiding something from me, and that is not going to make me happy. My medical knowledge tells me he got infected recently. He admitted he knows the source. We haven't spoken (read texted) much in the last few days; however, I told him I need to speak to him about some very important decisions I have taken regarding us. He told we can speak tonight.

He has been a very good friend to me over the last one and a half years, helping me with many of my things, especially that I'm in his country where the language is a big barrier for me (he speaks English, so we get along just fine). He barely had any fights, and I was actually quite happy with him. As much as he is suffering with his HIV diagnosis, I intend to ask him to come clean one last time, and if he doesn't, I should gently let him down, however hard that is for me. Of course, in the unlikely event that I test positive too, it may be a different ending all together.

Am I handling this situation correctly? Any advise and opinions on my predicament is welcome."

Let's pretend I have a cut on my lip, or bite my cheeks, or gum disease. If I give oral sex and the guy cums in my mouth is there a a very high level risk of exposure? What if I take is cum and we make out with it..

I got PEP after 40h and also caught gonorrhea. What scares the shit out of me is the CDC HIV calculator. If you click the options **CONDOM** then **STD + ACUTE HIV...** the risk is 1,000/10,000... **that's 10%!!!** Even if you add PEP at 90% effectiveness the risk is still 100/10,000 (1%)!

To me that is SCARY AS HELL. Is it possible I really am at a 1-10% risk of getting HIV with condoms? I thought I had calmed down but finding this out is insane. Thank you.

I got threatened with getting killed by my father at least 4 times and he almost did it and I ended up pretty much with a ptsd. I thought I was losing my mind, had bouts of depersonalization and derealization.

After a month of dealing with these issues I was with a friend and we had sex with a third person. I wore a condom the entire time, except took it off briefly after the first oral and stupidly used the same condom again after. As far is I could see the condom did not burst and my cum was still in it after I removed it after sex.

I got freaked out because we met the third person for the first time, so I did not know their background. When I asked if they had HIV through messages later they said no, but I also know they have a lot of unprotected sex.

I was put on pep a day later, but after 3 days when I went to the HIV centrum they told me the risk was so low that I should stop taking pep. About 5 days later I developed a rash on my inner thighs which looked like infected hair follicles. I was given an ointment with the doctor which helped it go away for the most part. I was also feeling itchiness all over my body which went away after 2 more days.

About 7 days later I started getting a small sore in my mouth that healed after 3 days followed by another sore. I also developed diarrhea. At the same time I also started noticing small rashes here and there that come and go withing like 30 minutes up to 2 hours. They are very mild and disappear after a little while. I also experienced burning on my chest at night and acid reflux.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really not in a good state of mind. It doesn't help my mother noticed I've been going to the doctor more often and to hurt me she said ""I hope you come down with an illness so bad that all you can do is be fully dependant on my like a dog and you cry about it until you die"".

&amp;#x200B;

I had a test the first day after sex and I was HIV negative, I'm waiting for the 6 week mark. I went to 3 different doctors who didn't think much of the rashes and both said if it was serious it would be body wide and not go away so fast. As for the diarrhea they think it is something else causing it. I told them I was scared of HIV but they said my symptoms were unusual and they didn't really suspect that. I am awaiting a stool and urine sample result right now and waiting about 3 more weeks so I can get tested for HIV again.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I'm typing all this is to see if anybody knows what might be going on and if maybe my suspicion of HIV is correct after all. I'm genuinely terrified guys."

Omg, I'm so grateful. I had been feeling fatigued for a while and I was worried I was positive. Last year I was involved with a guy who was neither honest nor monogamous and I'd had a handful of unprotected encounters with him. I let him finish in me twice one day (he was the only guy I'd ever had unprotected sex with). We didn't normally do that though. Earlier this year after I broke things off with him I had a bit of a slut phase and had two more unprotected encounters with some hookups because I liked the feeling of bareback and I was still heart broken. I let one hookup finish in me to make what I'd done with the guy I'd been involved with less special so I could get over him.

Earlier this year I found out the ex of the guy I'd been involved with who he was ""close friends"" with recently contracted HIV. I've been paranoid I was positive all year, even though I haven't had sex since May. I've been tested twice but I was worried about the window period where they can't detect it.

Long story short, PLEASE don't have unprotected sex unless you're on PreP. The time you spend worrying about whether you're positive or not will drain the life from you and make you miserable. Totally not worth it"

The first one, essentially we did not do much of anything, and I lost a bunch of money, however, my memory is a bit fuzzy. I only remember me giving her oral, no cum. She didn't respond to my texts the following day about her HIV status, PrEP etc. 

The second, I gave her oral, and I bottomed with a condom, she did not finish there. I finished her off with oral, but there was no or very little semen. She did respond to my texts, and said she was clean, frequently tested, uses protection. 

The next day, I went and got on PEP and started it within 18 hours of the first encounter. 

I have some problems, and this was a big wake up call for me. I drove drunk, hired escorts, and just acted completely out of character. I am going to quit drinking, and try to pick up some other outlets. 

I am writing this to get this off my chest because I feel like I can't talk to anyone. I also am hoping to get maybe some insight on how likely you think it might be that I contract HIV from this debacle. I am nervous, but being a numbers guy, I have been reading a lot and it seems that receptive anal is the most risky sexual situation to get HIV at 1.43% unprotected per incident, assuming the HIV+ person is not in acute infection stage or 37% if they are. I read condoms on average reduce risk by 80% and that PEP when started within 72 hours and adhered to exactly as prescribed reduces chances of infection by 92%. 

I guess, I am just scared, and I know none of this worry is helping me right now. I can't change the past. Please, any constructive advice, thoughts on how likely it is that I catch HIV, or kind words would be much appreciated. Also, if I do end up contracting it, any advice, or outlook on what life will look like from then on?"

He said he felt a bit ill, and with all this covid stuff happening i was afraid that he had it, but told me he was just a bit sick and that he tested negative for covid.

We met and in person he looked like he had a light cold, but as the night went by he started to look completely normal.

I am extremely paranoid with STDS, had an episode of thinking i had HIV for some swelling nodes after sucking a guy, i got tested for 6 months and all negative, the swollen lymph nodes remain even after almost one year of that episode. This episode triggerred a huge hypochondria in myself towards HIV. Doctors said i was just hypochondriac and had nothing.

This hypochondria makes me interrogate my dates before any sexual contact, i went to the place of this guy and we kissed, he said he had protected sex with a girl 2 weeks ago. Gotta remark his house was dirty as hell, ashe all around the floor, trash all around the room, even an open condom wrapper on the floor. 

He was taking painkillers for the coughing he had experience from his cold, later he confirmed he had bronchitis, he smokes around 10 joints of marihuana per day, and i think he also had a problem with cocaine. This drugs issues was why we stopped seeing each other eventually after a massive argument.

We had a really good night, gave him unprotected oral sex and kissed a lot. I liked him so much, and as a trans woman i don't usually meet very ""high quality"" guys, so i am used to allow stuff i shouldn't

We met a few times more and gave him unprotected sex in 3 more dates, also we had protected anal sex once, i was the one receiving.

In one of our last dates i saw he had a really obvious thrush, i freaked out because in my research about HIV i saw it was a big indicator of HIV, plus him being slightly ill. I commented to him that he could have HIV (i know, i am very straight forward). He is an extremelly irresponsible person (has condomless sex with random people, smokes a LOT, does cocaine...). He said ""if somebody passed me HIV i would kill them"", a phrase that didn't sounds rly great to me. But he started to say i was making him anxious commenting that, he played the victim and said i was being mean for making that comment, i suggested him to get tested and he said several times he would, but nowadays we have each other blocked so i will never know if he did.

In our last date he called me to spend the night with him, i went to prepare myself (i take really long to get ready, plus preparing for anal sex) so i spent like 30 minutes getting ready while i left the phone charging. When i went to text him and say i was ready i saw a lot of messages of him freaking out and saying i was with another guy (i assume it was a paranoia episode induced by maryjuana addiction, plus probably, cocaine). He said we went to sleep, called him and sent him pics of me in my house with my mom, but he was sleeping and ignoring me. I was SOOOO angry at him that i went to his place personally at 2AM and rang the door (yeah i am intense) and he came out of the house with an extremely weird attitude, looking like he took cocaine, very agressive and saying super weird stuff with no sense.

I went back home and on snapchat i offered myself to help him with drug addiction but he laughed saying i was acting like ""cinderella"" and that not even ""paris hilton"" should wake him up at night. I got really sad and felt used, because he said to me in a date that he wanted to be my boyfriend.

Currently i have my lymph nodes swollen again (they were permanently swollen after the other episode, but now even more) and today i experienced a really bad diarrhea, don't have fever at the moment, only swollen lymph nodes, maybe i ate something in bad state, idk, but i am afraid. I can not contact this guy anymore since i only had his snapchat and he blocked me there."

I had a hookup where the guy didn't tell me that he was HIV+ up after we kissed and smoked pot. He said that he was undetectable and on medication. No sex occured beyond this. (not even getting naked)

I got a burnt mouth from eating something earlier in the day.

Is there is a possibility that I have HIV now? I live in India so I am not even sure how I can acquire PEP."

In fact, I feel like I should start writing down my last will cause I'm not gonna be around much longer. I tested positive for HIV about a week ago. It's been well over 8 years since the last situation when I might've been infected. So I'm guessing the disease has progressed a lot since then. I never got tested before because frankly, I was prepared to meet my end a while ago. I was a US Marine, I truly believed I wouldn't come out of combat alive. That's why I never bothered with caring about myself or my future. Until I met my boyfriend and I got discharged from military. Now everything is different. 

My boyfriend means the world to me and I wouldn't be able to forgive myself if I infected him. I'm not that bothered by my inevitable, upcoming death but the thought of my boyfriend being sentenced to a short, painful life keeps me up at night and gives me constant panic attacks. I haven't decided whether he should know about my diagnosis yet but before I make the decision, he needs to get tested himself because he has no time to lose. I just don't know how to convince him."

We had lubed **protected** sex (oral and receptive/insertive anal) but I have anxiety so I got PEP after 1-2 days and fully finished it.

45 days later I went in to get tested. It turned out I caught gonorrhea so I got that treated, but besides that I have not gotten my 45 day test back yet for over 30+ days. **This means I have zero clue what my HIV status is right now.**

I was wondering how likely you are to get HIV from using condoms and PEP? And is a 3 month test conclusive or do you have to wait 6 months? Thanks."

I didn’t let him finish in me, but I’m scared he may have pre-came while inside of me. He was kind of a douche irl, and so I feel like if he did have HIV he would lie about not having it or something. How long do I have to wait to get tested?
