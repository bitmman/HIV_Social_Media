Although I have no idea what to expect. Do you just lube it up and stick it in there? Would it feel like pooping but backwards?? (xD) Do I need to u know.. clean the area beforehand? Any advice or comments would be very welcome! :)

So it's been about a month since I've gotten laid. Also, over the course of the last year it's been mostly one night stands and old fuck buddies.

I met this girl from out of town who's going to come visit me in two weeks time. She plans to spend the night with me on a Friday and might end up staying the weekend.

I'm not a slouch in the sack or anything but I'm looking to bring my A-game on this one. Frankly, she's really fun and attractive and I'd just really like to see her writhing in pleasure.

I'm wondering what kind of two week plan I could put into effect to get ready for that weekend. I'm open to any change in routine, diet, or regimen. Should I be masturbating regularly? Stuff like that. Suggestions?

EDIT: Just to clear things up, I'm not nervous about hooking up with this girl. I just want to know if anybody preps in any way if they're trying to go above and beyond. Thanks for the advice so far.

EDIT2: Late update. Sorry all. Not sure if anybody will see this. Frankly, it went great. We had a couple amazing throws between the sheets that night and a few the next. She's coming back this weekend (11/3) and bringing her roommate. I'm a lucky man...


**TL;DR I'm going to be hooking up with a girl in two weeks and want some ideas to aid my performance.**"

I'm just a little paranoid that when he fucks me his dick might have blood on it and freak him out even though I know I'm 100% clean of all STD's and STI's. Thanks for all your help!"

What I do want to know is which anal toys are good to use as prep for anal?

For example, I heard butt plugs aren't that good because they just give that filling feeling and don't actually help expand the hole (or get used to the feeling of it being expanded)... But maybe it is good because it gets the person using it used to the feeling of having stuff in there?  Are anal beads just used to get a better orgasm, or are they helpful for anal? Are there anal dildos out there? Are they better than butt plugs?  Would vibrations be better or worse if the goal is to take out the toy and have butt sex after its usage?

At this point we're just adding fingers, but I think a toy might be more comfortable and fun. Thanks for any info!"

I've learned since then to be a very good Dom and she's always been an amazing sub for me.

Recently, we watched a porno together where a woman was being used sexually by a man. He'd make her switch from oral sex to eating out his asshole, and at some point it all focused primarily on him having his asshole eaten out.

Since then, my girlfriend has been obsessed with the idea of trying to eat out my ass. I'm starting to come around to it as well, but I need some advice on what to do beforehand.

Some factors are that I've never done any anal play whatsoever. I also have a little forest on my butt, meaning that it's immensely hairy. Should I ask for help shaving that particular spot?

I have tried anal fingering a handful of times, and I don't know if I have the proper technique, and surprisingly a quick internet search did not reveal anything too helpful, so I turn to the sexxitors haha.


So when I plan on fingering I make sure I have a bowel movement that day so my colon is clean and I shower and scrub everything back there so it's all squeaky as well, and for the actual fingering my nails are trimmed and I use a creamy salve or coconut oil as a lube, as a more sex-oriented lube isn't readily available to me.

OK so my first question is how do I successfully find my prostate? I heard it's like 2-3 inches in on your belly side, but I don't feel any bumps or lumps when I feel. I don't know if I'm going too far or not. Any advice for that?



Also, is it easy to hurt yourself/ your testicles through anal penetration? Because a few times when I have tried it afterwards my balls (usually only one) has a dull ache in it. Pain sometimes when I try to clench it. So is this just after-cum aching or in my head, or can I mess them up if I finger myself wrong? Any advice there is much appreciated as well.



Side note: I want to try small insertions with a dildo or something like it but don't have cash for sex toys right now? Any home/DIY toys you guys know work or recommend?

3o3k88,[Advice] Struggling with anal sex prep,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/3o3k88/advice_struggling_with_anal_sex_prep/,32Goobies,1,2015-10-09 06:27:22,1,/r/sex/comments/3o3k88/advice_struggling_with_anal_sex_prep/,NaN,"My partner and I have been together for several years and are planning to get married. We both love sex and have high libidos, with me being a bit more adventurous and willing to try things than him. However, he was the one who talked me into anal, and while I love it, I struggle with the prep. 

I usually use a douche(clean water of course) for my own peace of mind and then work through a few sizes of butt plugs to get myself ready for the main course(and as his dick is a bit plus sized this is extremely vital). Usually I also masturbate while I'm doing it because orgasms help everything. Every once in a while he will help with the logistics of getting the plugs in and he will let me touch and go down in him, but he really doesn't do much except watch until it's time for the actual stuff he's into. 

My problem is that it's just too clinical and it's not sexy and I don't feel very desired or aroused. We've started watching porn together while I'm working on the plugs but he's really not super into it and it's mostly for me to stay aroused. We'll play around with DP with plugs and vaginal sex and that feels amazing and then we eventually get to the actual good bit. 

To be clear, I love anal sex, once we get to it. The only time I've ever orgasmed from any penetration has been with anal. But it's such a pain in the ass(lol) to get ready, takes so much time, and is so discouraging that I have started avoiding it. He suggests it every week and while I want to do it I just put it off because of time issues and cause I don't wanna deal with all the work I gotta do. But he loves it, probably more than vaginal sex(I'm quite snug for him and sometimes have lubrication problems so anal is hugely different from PIV). 

I've tried explaining to him that I need his more active participation but he doesn't know what to do, and honestly, neither do I. Toys kind of turn him off, so having to use plugs and a vibrator to get to a good point does disinterest him most of the time. We've tried using fingers to prep instead of plugs but it's just not the same because his fingers, short of fisting me, just don't do enough. 

I've also gained some weight that I'm trying to work off, and he's 100% supportive of me either way, but of course I don't expect him to be as physically attracted to me as he was when I was lighter. I know that factors into things as well. 

Anyways, I really could use some advice on the situation."

And I engage in behavior that puts me at higher risk of contracting HIV. Specifically, I sometimes go to adult theaters and have oral sex with men. (I'm a man.) I know that I shouldn't, but I slip.

The same cycle plays out over and over again: I succumb to my desires, and then even though I usually use condoms and almost always avoid anal sex (I've never been a bottom, and have only been a top twice), I freak out for the next few weeks. So I've been considering asking my doctor for a prescription for Truvada. As I understand it, it's nearly 100% effective at preventing HIV infection when taken consistently.

But my question is: what are the drawbacks? Other than having to take a pill every day (I already take several), and potentially cost (it's covered by my insurance, and I can handle the copay), why shouldn't I take Truvada to give myself additional reassurance? How common are the side effects, and are they usually tolerable?"

439az6,"[Question] I know the basics of anal prep. But what about DIET the day before and day of, with the goal of minimizing gas, etc?",https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/439az6/question_i_know_the_basics_of_anal_prep_but_what/,how2bclean,304,2016-01-29 07:42:55,87,/r/sex/comments/439az6/question_i_know_the_basics_of_anal_prep_but_what/,NaN,"Hi /r/sex!

**Unimportant preface:** I know that pre-anal, in terms of cleanliness, eating less (or not at all) for the few hours before + having a good poop + a thorough shower is enough. Some people like a couple enemas to be really extra clean. I'm not intending to do big (PIA) penetration, just small dildo/fingers so I'm not worried about enemas and I've played around without any incident.

HOWEVER...

**Main issue:** I love anal play but often have to turn it down if unprepared because I feel **VERY GASSY** fairly often. Not to the point of discomfort, but to the point where I'd be REALLY nervous I'm going to fart (in a potentially smelly way) if we stick even small things in there. Like, you might sneak the fart at your desk and it wouldn't be a big deal but if someone had their finger in your ass at the time, it'd be a little *embarrassing*. For me, that would be a huge turn-off even though it's my own butthole. I feel like I fart *often* and I have a moderately healthy diet with a fair amount of fibre. I'm not going to commit suicide if it happens but I'd still really like to try to avoid it.

**Can you guys help me out with diet tips for day before &amp; the day of anal play?** I want to do anal with a small toy, tomorrow afternoon or evening. . **I don't know how to alter my diet in a way that will reduce the amount of normal gas I seem to have.**

----

**SUMMARY OF GATHERED INFORMATION**

* **Pharmaceutical options:** Gas-x (may cause diarrhea, try on non-anal day first), Beano, and similar; Lactaid if lactose is a suspect

* **Dairy-related issues:** I'm unlikely to be genuinely intolerant but it could very well be causing gas. Either avoid lactose near hopeful-anal days (aged cheddar cheese has low lactose content! yes!!!!), substitute milk for almond milk or similar (NOT SOY), or use Lactaid or similar product before ingesting dairy.

* **Other stuff likely to cause gas:** Oat bran, some kinds of whole grain and to a lesser degree wheat itself, broccoli (I am betrayed), brussel sprouts, cabbage, soy and other beans/legumes, prunes, apricots, apples, raisins, bananas, potatos rutabaga and turnip, cauliflower, asparagus, cucumbers, really fatty foods in general (ie rich cream sauces and deep-fried oily things). **Wow, 99.5% of my entire diet is contained within this list, no wonder I have a lot of gas!**

* **Other things to do besides avoiding troublesome foods:** Yoga wind-relieving pose or ""hitting the bathroom to fart"" pre-sex; eating yogurt or drinking Kefir not right-before anal but in general for the sake of probiotics to reduce gas; not worrying so much; farting all over him anyway.

* **Metamucil** and **avoiding red meat** were also suggested, but metamucil is known to cause gas and cramps so I will avoid it (I don't think more fibre is the right option for me), and I don't eat red meat already (although thanks for the idea anyway). **Paleo/keto diet** was also suggested - cutting out grains and processed foods - but I eat mostly vegetarian so this isn't compatible with my lifestyle, but could work for readers who are following this!

----

**CONCLUSION + REMAINING CONFUSION**

A diet rich in fibre seems important for relatively clean anal due to pooping well, but all these suggestions would dramatically reduce fibre intake (except metamucil). So I suspect the best option is to continue my diet as normal - maybe reduce some gassy foods for my own comfort, but what's even left to substitute them with? - but a day or two before anal, make an effort to eat plain rice, steamed non-gassy veggies like carrots, and little/no lactose, AND/OR use something like gas-x. And don't eat for a few hours immediately before anal."
4alj7s,[Threesome Prep] Boyfriend wants to have sex with me[f] and my best [f]riend?,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/4alj7s/threesome_prep_boyfriend_wants_to_have_sex_with/,throwaway18271827,3,2016-03-15 18:18:01,14,/r/sex/comments/4alj7s/threesome_prep_boyfriend_wants_to_have_sex_with/,NaN,"(Throwaway for obvious reasons)

 So a bit of context: My Boyfriend and I have been best friends since high school, and are nearly at the 3 year mark in our relationship. We're both 19 and in a (somehow) extremely happy long distance relationship.

 I've been very honest with him up to recently, telling him how much I love being dominated, we have a lot of fun in the bedroom and are extremely open with each other. Our relationship itself is fantastic, we lead completely separate lives, have a large amount of trust with each other and up until now I assumed we had an amazing understanding of our wants and needs.

 While playing truths a month ago over the phone he asked me what my opinion was of sex clubs. He's mentioned briefly about them before and I took note of this, however he hasn't mentioned it since. When I told them I didn't really know what they were he told me in great detail the experience his friend had when he went, and what he was told was in each room etc. Already horny I told him it sounded really hot, and we talked about having sex in front of others and maybe me having my first encounter with a girl and we would have a threesome. This made him turn absolutely crazy and we stayed up until 5am talking about the possibilities. Once we calmed down we discussed that it definitely wouldn't be something we'd do in the near future as we'd like to find some stability living together and maybe wait until our sex life isn't as good.

 We've still sexted regularly about what it would be like, talking about scenarios we could play out and what we'd do. I mentioned to him the fact that the person I'd most likely be comfortable doing it with would be my best friend. At the start of our friendship she had a small crush on me and I jokingly told her that if anything happened with myself and my boyfriend then I'd end up losing my girl on girl virginity with her, although this was around a year ago. Now we're extremely close and speak almost daily, we're very open about our sex lives and she's now at a stage of her life where she wants to experiment with her sex life, being interested in submission, but also with the main attempt to have fun. She is a very free spirited person and we have a very open, trusting and amazing friendship. I have never experienced feelings for her romantically, and to be honest don't have feelings for women in general sexually, but pushing this aside I feel that we're all at a point in our lives where we can have fun and grow as people, and I think it could be an extremely pleasurable experience.
 
 So I'm seeing my boyfriend and best friend next weekend, and he really seems eager to have this threesome. It sounds great, and I have a large idea that my best friend would be up for it, however I have a few issues. One being that I have no idea how to initiate it. Our plan is to go out drinking and stopping at my boyfriends house that night, which is already organised. My best friend and boyfriend don't know each other very well, but get on with each other when I bring them together every now and then. I know I'll bring it up with her this week to see how she'd genuinely feel, but i don't want to ruin any spontaneity so might keep this as just finding out her feelings and again asking her consent when she's invited over. However, how I bring it up and initiate the sex I am lost by.
 
 Also wondering what the long term implications of this will be. I'm petrified this might create tension in our friendship, or her friendship with my boyfriend. How do I make sure there is no awkwardness or any chance of either of the relationships I have with these people go through any stress? They are both large parts of my life and I really want to make sure that there are steps in place to avoid any difficulties in future.

 Any help, advice, tips in bed and feedback would be absolutely amazing. I'm very open to all of this and think this could be so much fun and exciting if done right, however I can't help but worry about any repercussions.

 TL;DR: Trying to find a way to have a threesome with my BF and BFF without a shitty aftermath."

If you don't have any anal play (sex, toys, digits) for 6 months, are you back to square one? What about shorter time frames?

Thanks in advance for the feedback. "

5m4vc9,[Anal Prep] Prepping for Poop,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/5m4vc9/anal_prep_prepping_for_poop/,clipsandships,6,2017-01-04 22:38:10,7,/r/sex/comments/5m4vc9/anal_prep_prepping_for_poop/,NaN,"Hello! Posting on my porn account so my reddit friends don't have to hear about my asshole.


So I'm an active, healthy, early 20's male who's reasonably open to trying new things. When I was with my ex, we briefly discussed the purpose of anal stimulation. She (being a biology major) kept telling me that it's useless for her because *I* was the one with a prostate. Needless to say I never got to throw my stick into the mud if you know what I mean.


I did consider what she had to say though, and so a couple of times now I've tried anal by myself (hopefully less lonely than it sounds). Each time I tried was in the shower with enough soap to ease the passage (but not enough to burn, it's also mostly essential oils and such so it's more like a foamy lotion than a harsh soap), and each time, I stick my finger right into poop.


I don't feel the need to drop a deuce, and I'm not exactly afraid of fecal matter, but I wonder why it's always there. Should I be shitting more often in preparation for anal? If I one day stick my dick in the bum of an active, healthy, early 20's female who's open to trying new things, will part of the process involve pushing her shit further back into her booty with my stickity-dick? (Not the most charming euphemism I'm afraid, but it's fun to say). Should I be performing some sort of cleanse or buy those scary red bags used for enemas? I really dont want to have to do an enema though. 


For the record, I don't find it uncomfortable to stick my finger up there. I figured tensing up would make the whole thing worse, so I'm rather relaxed when I try it. I even found the prostate, but I don't really feel anything special from it, just a slight tingling sensation I guess. I'm also not really sure if I can clear the tunnel properly in prep for anal though. Because sometimes I actually find it difficult to loose a log, I can't exactly drop deuce on command and forcing it out doesn't really make me feel excited for anal. I'll keep at it, but any and all advice is appreciated. I should also mention that it feels like poking a full on log, not like a small dainty smear of shit, like poking a meaty, brown roll of cookie dough.

Sorry for the word wall, I tend to go on sometimes. "

It feels great for both of us, and she especially enjoys the submissive / taboo mental aspects of it.  However, both of us are starting to get tired of the dang prep work that goes into it.

Anal training plugs, getting her as relaxed as possible via foreplay etc, copious copious amounts of lube.  The good news - that all works!  The bad news - that takes forever, and the amount of lube seems overkill.

She's gotten pretty into us playing out the occasional consensual non-consent fantasy, but in the moment it kind of kills our momentum if all of a sudden we have to spend 15 minutes doing somewhat methodical (although enjoyable) prep tasks.  The whole consensual non-consent thing doesn't seem to lend itself well to anal.

However, last time we tried it, she told me not to use the lube - in the heat of the moment I agreed and we just used her vaginal wetness and spit, which seemed fine at the time but her anus ended up itching for a couple days.  We think it was a small tear.  So obviously some is needed.

My question / tl;dr - how much lube do you all ACTUALLY use once you've gotten accustomed to anal?  Do you use plugs to prepare every time?  Do you ever start with anal, before other forms of sex?  For those of you who engage in consensual non-consent, how do you go about prepping for anal and keep the illusion / energy alive?"

Long distance boyfriend visiting this weekend (he's 24M, I'm 26F.) We've known each other for a while, met in person 4 times on extended trips. We skype regularly and after last visit (half a year ago), have started skyping sexy time shows - nothing crazy just mutual masturbation, etc. We both know and love how the other looks but haven't gotten physically intimate together yet.

He's visiting this weekend and I think sex is on the menu :P If so, it will be the end of a long dry spell for both of us. What are some of the things that I should do to get ready that I might've forgotten? Obviously hygiene is important and I bought some new/sexy clothing for bedroom time. I have condoms, lube, etc, etc. What else should I think about?

And, more importantly, to those who have hooked up for the first time with a long distance partner, how was it? Was it awkward at first? My biggest fear is it's sexy on cam, on skype, through text messages, and then the chemistry just falls flat in person due to nerves or shyness.

Any thoughts?"

I have never, and still don't, know what the proper label for my sexual orientation is. I've only dated dudes (3 to be exact). I'm kind of an introvert, and don't find myself talking to women often. When I do, I have never felt any sort of romantic attraction like I have with men. Then again, I haven't ever had a close friendship with a woman either.  Don't get me wrong, the thought of being with a guy really excites me romantically. The past relationships I've had were wonderful while they lasted. But when in them I always wondered what I was missing on the other side of the fence. 

I've spent a lot of time browsing this subreddit lately, and naturally the posts are almost exclusively about straight couples. And I've noticed that the excitement and joy people get out of sex, as well as the spontaneity of it, is something I've never experienced with my previous sexual encounters. 

I see examples of straight couples having sex when the mood arises, or after a massage, basically whenever its right. But with male on male, for actual intercourse to happen there needs to be some level of planning beforehand, and more finagling is required to get the actual act started. 

It probably sounds silly, but after all the coordination involved with it is done, I find myself too stressed out to actually enjoy it. Maybe it's controversial, but your butt just isn't designed to be used for sex, and it requires a lot more hassle to get it started. 

Or is it just me? Maybe I've been doing it wrong this whole time. I find myself avoiding sex because I never feel ""ready to go"" unless I've had time beforehand to prep. Boyfriend comes over by surprise? -- nothing spontaneous is gonna happen, and it kills it for me. I've woken up with my previous boyfriend in the morning and we were both in the mood, but by the time one of us gets up and goes to clean up, the moment is ruined. A straight couple in this scenario would be able to go at it without worry. "

We stayed at a place we normally do for our anniversary, she wasn't feeling too great so penetrative sex was off the table anyway, perfect timing.

Got her to lay on her front and rub her clit while I liked her vagina from behind, whilst I rubbed some strawberry lube on her asshole 'cause she enjoys a bit of teasing. 
This was after making sure it was clean with a baby wipe as well, she was just expecting a finger...


Sadly she didn't orgasm from it due to bad cramp in her legs putting her off but she reeeeally enjoyed it, she didn't even freak out when I started doing it.
She's the sort of person who'd have refused and been like ""No you don't have to...!"" had I asked beforehand. She would have been worried it was too dirty and all that.


Anyway I was at it for a good thirty minutes or so, rock hard the whole time. Ton of fun.
Afterwards I rinsed my mouth out with mouthwash and during it I was making sure not to swallow my spit...I mean it was all clean down there but, it's still an anus, right?


Do I need to be as careful as this or is it generally pretty safe provided it's been cleaned? Didn't want to take the chance. I didn't get ill after it or anything just...with the spit thing it got kinda messy, had to keep wiping my mouth with a towel.
Think that was a little off putting on her end.


Felt really rewarding to do, I've almost mastered my cunni game and she orgasms basically every time unless she's not feeling well so it was hot to do something new.
If any guys(or gals) out there are on the fence trying it and their partner would like to experience it, I'd say give it a go.

/r/relationships locked my post and said to post here instead. I am looking for relationship advice, thank you.

We were having a hot sex session after my shower, both a bit tipsy, and he was spitting on my ass and licking it. I said he needed lube if he wanted more, but he still shoved his dick in my ass. I've made it clear how wrong that is. He says he was just too caught up in the moment - which only makes me worry about what other harm will happen while he's too caught up. 



He's an incredibly sweet guy and obviously apologetic. It's been really upsetting him to hear my distress/pain when I poop (bloody for a few days). I do not think he did this intentionally and I believe he's incredibly sorry, but the fact remains that he did do this because he can't control himself when turned on - by his own words. I really do think he would not hurt me intentionally and this is an anomaly. I know how this sounds but he's been very sweet and supportive for a long time and this is just a drunken incident. He wasn't trying to hurt me. 



How do we work past this?



Tl;dr: boyfriend was drunk, went for the butt without lube"

I asked for his and he said he gets his results off the phone so he does not have a physical copy but he can get tested again. However my dumbass decided to have sex with him before him doing that. 

Tho we wore a condom I bleed which makes me fear that if he has HIV it can go down my blood stream.

And when I asked him if we can go raw since I got tested (jokingly). He said I would need to not fuck anyone else in a month and get tested.

He seems to be the most concerned about STIs more than any guy which scares me because maybe he is purposely doing that so if I get it I don’t assume it’s from him. He also told me he has alopecia on his chin and I heard that’s symptoms of HIV

9br8ko,How much prep should I do if I want someone to suck cum out of me after anal?,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/9br8ko/how_much_prep_should_i_do_if_i_want_someone_to/,wintercheesecake,3,2018-08-30 23:27:12,7,/r/sex/comments/9br8ko/how_much_prep_should_i_do_if_i_want_someone_to/,NaN,"I am very sorry for the title, I wasn’t sure how else to word it and now I feel like it’s too vulgar haha. Anyway, me and my BF have very high libidos and passions for anal sex. We have anal every other day (but multiple times on the days we do have it) and I would 100% have it on a more daily basis, but his cum/the quantity of cum left in me does things to my bowels that make that goal difficult to achieve. Also, rest days are important.

ANYWAY. Currently, I don’t do too much prep for anal in my opinion – I eat really healthy in general, I’m regular, etc. I do clean myself out with a 120ml/4 oz syringe however many times is necessary prior to anal (like 75% of the time I do this), and this I’ve found keeps me squeaky clean and tasteless for up to 6 hours. I believe what I do is considered douching. I have never tried to push cum out of my ass before, and I’m worried that my current routine is not enough for his cum to be..clear if you will.

For those of you who are able to successfully push cum out of your ass, what do you do for prep? Should I be giving myself full-blown enemas? Or should I just have him cum not as deep in me? Should I start taking psyllium husk? We don’t use lube when we have anal if it matters, just spit + my vaginal fluids.

I suggested that she might prep by using a realistic dildo while masturbating in the days/weeks leading up to having sex. But her comment was that it is the friction aspect of a real cock that a dildo doesn't have that matters. So there is that....

This is a first for me. So I [M20] met a girl [F20] the other weekend at a party and we really hit it off. She lives and studies in a different city and was only here for the weekend. The only reason  we didn't have sex the  was she was staying with a friend, and they had an early start the next day.

We've been chatting since and it was brought up that this weekend I could travel down and spend a few days with her. I really liked her, she really liked me and I'm honestly really excited about this!

Now obviously I know that nothing is ever guaranteed, and that past consent /= future consent, and that all manner of things could happen that I haven't even considered. However, I do think there is a high probability that at some point this weekend we'll have sex.

And that's where you come in, dear internet strangers! I'm not a virgin, but it's been a while since I got down and dirty and  I want to make sure things go well! So I'm turning to the good sexual deviants of reddit to help me out. I've been given the rare benefit (for me at least) of preparation time, as opposed to a spontaneous encounter, and I intend to make use of it! I'm going to go extra hard on my personal hygiene, give my pubes a good tidying up (over a year of being single hasn't helped me on that front) and avoid catching any colds over the next few days; but if anyone has any additional tips to help me bring my A game, I'd love to hear them! I've never done anything like this before, and I really wanna make sure it goes well!

I tired anal for the first time two months ago. I used an enema. I felt clean. Was ready to try. We were having a very heated night when I suggested we give it a go.

He was great. Lubbed when I said I needed more. Took his time. Listened. Was attentive. It didn’t even hurt. I was surprised. I wasn’t to sure if I liked it but I didn’t HATE it.

He loved it. While we were going at it, he was just so vocal. It was turning me on.

Then suddenly I realized my boyfriend wasn’t behind me.

Disappeared.

I was confused.

Why was he in the bathroom....?!? oh god!! I ran to the kitchen, grabbed a tissue and wiped my butt praying to the Old Gods and New to please come away clean....

....It was not clean.....

I was horrified. Despite all my prep work, I’m pretty sure I shat on my boyfriend’s dick. Now I have to dump him.

He came out of the bathroom. I told him I was going to bed. He asked why. I gave him the WTF look.

Guys. If a woman accidentally gets fecal matter on your dick, do what my boyfriend did. Ignore it and carry on. He hugged me, gave me a kiss, told me to go wash up and get back to the bed so we can carry on.

He didn’t mention poop on him at all. I’m ASSuming that if there was on me, there was on him. But he never actually said there was.

We carried on with other sex afterwards.

I don’t know what I did wrong with my prep. Any pointers would be GREATLY APPRECIATED because clearly I didn’t do something right.

Also. Can people have an “anal orgasm”? I read about it here somewhere and wasn’t sure if it is true. Someone mentioned an orgasm via the butt, not a vaginal orgasm due to anal.

I'm just wondering, is there a chance you can get hiv from someone who is on PrEP. I mean like obviously theres a chance but like can you contract hiv even if theyre on it but I mean   if theyre taking prep to protect themselves does the prep just protect them or will it protect a third party too. not sure if im asking this right I'm just a bit paranoid now.

My partner and i attempted this once and each new stage was so painful, it was taking forever, leading us both to lose the mood and him to become flaccid, and generally just a bad experience which ended up in us giving up. 

Another time we just decided to go for it, in about 10-20 seconds he was entirely inside and gently thrusting. There was pain for the first 30 seconds or so and then it started to feel great. No more issues... just a good time. The first couple times we did this there was a tiny bit of blood and now, several experiences later, there's literally no issues. Its just way too painful if he enters slowly and then waits there without moving.

Side note: we dont use condoms for anal (clean and monogamous). this causes less friction, but still the first method sucks compared to the second!

I cant help but wonder why my experience is the way it is? If everyone reached the consensus that working your way up is the best way to do it, then why was working my way up way too painful yet immediately getting to it not? Anyone else have a similar anal experience?"

I’m not talking about foreplay at all. I’ve been sexually active for a few months now, semi-regularly. And sex is great. I should say that right away. He’s really attentive and definitely makes sure I’m warmed up and everything properly. I don’t think there is really anything else to be done in the sac. He really does the most he can. The only problem is... I’m not really excited for sex anymore. Like all the anticipation is kinda gone. 

So I’ve been wondering, from the account of other women, is there any way of exciting yourself before sex that really works? Like I’ve been wondering, for example, if having a clitoral orgasm before I go to his place to hook up might be an interesting take- as things tend to be much more sensitive. Or if that would make me less inclined to initiate, as I kind of satiated myself recently. To ease that, perhaps working myself up to almost orgasm and then going to his place might make me more desperate, therefore maybe the sex would be more exciting and fulfilling? Or maybe the orgasmic feeling would go away and leave me feeling even more frustrated.

Also, if any women can relate, did you manage to overcome this? how so? Also, dudes, if you have any insight please feel free let me know. Maybe some interesting sex positions or tricks that you know to spice it up would also help just in general."

I'm worried that if my condom goes up a little when I thrust hard or with a longer stroke, the tiny collection of fluid will be momentarily exposed or leak away.

Or if I adjust it, the fluid gets exposed again and touches my skin.

I get really worried. 

Also because of this, it makes me wonder if this is not my right fit. But I think it most probably is (on the degree of anything untoward happening) since I measure at 7 - 7.1(17.8 centimeters) inch and the condom says 18 centimetres accommodation. 
And then there's the additional factor of the girth. My girth too is at 5.6. Which is proportionately leaning towards larger for an 18 centimetre condom. Shouldn't that be more decisive for a change than length? 


Then there's the routine before putting it on even - I wash my hands quite a bit (along with my dick). After drying, I make very sure to not get so hard that I produce pre-cum or big that it will cause difficulty in sliding the condom on. After which I pat down the my protected penis with some cloth. Is that a more than necessary? 

Can someone please evaluate my observations and that particular routine and offer any advice if it is needful of any? And if not reaffirm my concerns"

I hope you guys can give me some advice. So my boyfriend (24m)and I (27f) have started having anal sex and we really enjoy it. Usually there's lots of anal foreplay, warm up and such, and usually it goes really well. So last night we were spooning in bed, when I felt him get hard. So we started grinding, things get hot and heavy, and he asks me for the lube. Knowing where this was going I get on my knees and he starts pushing his dick in. Now, here's where the problem came in. It's been a big fantasy of mine to let him just spontaneously fuck my ass, no prep or anything. But I just couldn't relax and it hurt like hell. Being the amazing guy he is, the second I made any indication I was in pain he stopped, and cuddled me (all the while apologizing).
So my question is - any advice on how to get myself more relaxed or more prepared for spontaneous butt stuff?"

We tried once with a finger, but I got uncomfortable when his finger came out with a little poop on it. And I felt embarrassed as if poop shouldn't be there.
Recently we got a tiny butt plug with a weight in it. We decided I'd wear it to dinner. It felt interesting, not uncomfortable at all. However sitting for such a long period got sensitive. So I went to the bathroom and took it out. There was some poop on it again. I felt fine but only because he didn't see.

Later that night we had sex and at the end I rolled over and found a little patch of poop. I was extremely humiliated- he handled it amazingly. Said there was nothing to be embarrassed about it was natural.

I got up and cleaned it. Ever since then I've been very paranoid about it.

Is there a way to make it.. Cleaner before play? And to avoid this happening again? I didn't feel it coming out which makes me nervous it will just happen.

Please help! I'm very excited for anal play, how do I help the embarrassment and/ or clean better?"

Why isn't this pill big in the heterosexual community? I thought something like this would revolutionise casual sex kinda like how the pill did for women. Shouldn't everyone be using this pill if their having casual sex, even if they wore a condom/took the pill? Would taking PrEP give you some piece of mind or not?

I'm very keen to hear everyones prospective on this, irrespective or gender / orientation. 

Are there lots of hetro people who use this pill? Why does it seem to be only bi/gay men who use this? Whats the daily process, age restrictions, side affects, limits of taking this pill. Whats the cost of the pills and how many do you get? I live in Australia, so is it covered under medicare? Do people judge you from using the pill when you tell them you use it?

I learned in school that nucleoside analogues like Truvada are very effective at preventing HIV in uninfected individuals. They basically work by preventing the HIV virus from replicating to a level where someone would get a systemic infection.

Interestingly enough, Valtrex, the treatment prescribed for people with genital herpes, is also a nucleoside analogue. I've never heard of it being used in uninfected individuals. My guess though is that this is for cost and public health reasons, not necessarily because of efficacy. I don't think insurance companies would want to pay for a drug that prevents a non-life threatening skin infection, especially when there are no symptoms. The same goes for potential side effects... I don't think doctors would want to prescribe a drug with side effects to people to prevent something non-lethal like herpes.

However, I have a feeling it would work. I personally am concerned about getting HSV from hooking up. Unlike HIV, gonorrhea, and syphilis, it can be transmitted even with condoms. And unlike HPV (which also can be transmitted without condoms), the infection is lifelong. Would it potentially be a good idea to try taking Valtrex if I am going to hook up? I'm curious about it, and I would be angry at myself if I got HSV and I didn't take it.  What do you all think?"

I recently purchased a wevibe prostate massager, as the idea of a stronger or different orgasm really excited me.  I haven't received it yet (it'll be here in a few days), but I wanted to try to explore a bit this evening on my own while my wife was out.

I'd used one of her smaller vibes before just to see how it felt, and nixed that idea quickly solely because it's not flared and I'm not going to be one of those ER stories.  It's hard to explain how it felt besides I guess...maybe it just takes a bit to get past the anus but you can tell when it's past?  I could feel that and it was ok, but the nerves of losing it definitely killed any possible enjoyment.

I tried today with a g-spot vibrator which, admittedly, was a little girthier.  Also, made of plastic, which I think is part of the issue here as well.  I used what I thought was a fair amount of lube, and could only get maybe...2-3"" in?  It just didn't feel good and I didn't think it would go any further, so I pulled it out and noticed there was blood on the towel I was laying on.  I used some toilet paper and dabbed a little more blood, bright pink/red, and then was fine - although I definitely do feel like I have a hemorrhoid at the moment.  I took a shower after and was sure to wash her toy thoroughly as well.

My question is...how do you work up to something like this?  Secondly, how long do I heal before giving it another go?  I'm hoping with a silicone toy things go much smoother.  I'm really keen to explore this but have no idea how to go about it (obviously).  Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

I'm considering an interesting question these days. Short note - I know it's corona times, but this general question is mostly related to post corona times (one must hope, right?).

A background about myself: I'm in a heterosexual relationship, but we also go to sex parties every once in a while, and plan also to entertain guests (or rather will do after corona). Skip the full explanation for the eventual question.

\-------------------------------------------------------

Full explanation:

I'm a true believer of religious condom use with partners with unknown status (+3 months it takes for all the STIs to appear on tests). Lately I though about re-examining this because of the following:

1. There are currently several STIs that are known.
2. Out of them, several are treatable with antibiotics (although there are antibiotic-resistant strains, but as far as I understand they are still not wide-spread)
3. So, as long as you are willing to treat yourself with antibiotics if needed, and do a frequent STI test (3-6 months), you are left with the Incurable diseases.
4. Incurable #1, #2: HPV &amp; Herpes - known to be apparent in most sexually human beings (so most of sexually active already got it, or have a vaccine against HPV), and also known that is also transferred via skin-to-skin so condoms don't provide protection, right? I'm not sure, but this is what I understood.
5. Incurable #3, #4: Hepatitis B, C - Hep B has a vaccine, Hep C considered as rarely transmitted sexually.
6. And finally Incurable #5 - The big one - HIV - with the existence of PrEP, if taken as prescribed, chances of contracting HIV are significantly lower.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Question:** If both partners are vaccinated against anything possible (Hep B, and the female counterpart for HPV, in my country HPV for males over certain age is to administered), and assuming they take take PrEP and do STI checks, is occasionally adding additional people into their sex life without condoms still a considerable risk?"

The lighting was dimmed and just had an atmosphere to it overall.  I was immediately in the mood just on the scent around the house alone.  

But when it came to sex, the foreplay wasn’t even five minutes and he even tried to do it without a condom.  I insisted that he put one on and he did.  Since the foreplay was so short, I’m sure he can tell I wasn’t wet.  He never asked if I was comfortable during sex.  He lasted around five minutes before cumming, I didn’t time him but it wasn’t that long.  It was my first time and yes it did hurt as I was pretty dry down there.  I totally lost the mood when I exited the house, I guess it’s cause I couldn’t smell that perfume anymore.  My vagina burned like never before when I got home and I contracted a pretty bad UTI and vaginal infection (not STD) the next day.

I don’t expect my first time to be squirting orgasms and fireworks but I feel like he ignored my pleasure/comfort and just took his own.

I understand the concept/how to of enemas and that they are a useful tool for removing the possibility of poop as mush as possible. But I am hesitant to offer it up with out feeling like I’ve limited my diet for the day, done a quick enema bulb, checked with my finger to see if there’s any stragglers and even then I’m nervous about smell or poop stuck on his dick or feeling it when he’s in. I should say that my husband completely understands this and it’s a risk he’s willing to take. So my question is for people that have anal frequently, can you please share your experiences about what you do (if anything) to mitigate poop risk? Are people really doing enemas every day they have PIA - would seem to take some of the sexiness out of it if every time your like wait, let me go bulb out my butt, I’ll be right back. Dirty details please."
nhvchu,Looking for full anal prep tips,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/nhvchu/looking_for_full_anal_prep_tips/,SmolDumpsterFire,1,2021-05-21 08:33:13,9,/r/sex/comments/nhvchu/looking_for_full_anal_prep_tips/,NaN,"So I've read through [https://howtocleanyourass.wordpress.com/](https://howtocleanyourass.wordpress.com/) and from the looks of it, I'd basically have to do a full prep enema if I'm going for deep anal plays. Are there any frequent full preppers that have certain habits or tips that works for you to make the enema / full prep process easier?

Like will the 6 tbsps of whole psyllium husk I eat per day help make it faster / less fills to clean out? Should I up the amount to meet the 38g recommended dietary fiber amount? 

Note: Currently at 26.1g for 6 tbsps according to the bag info. I skip breakfast almost every day and for lunch and dinner, I usually only eat one full meal and snack for the other. Have yet to experience any stomach cramps, constipation, diarrhea, or other noticeable problems from over consumption.

Do you enema earlier before the act? If so, how far ahead of time do you do it? Do you do another quick enema before getting down to it after enema-ing earlier? 

Or is there some trick you've used to skip enema-ing altogether since enema-ing often is bad? Please share with me your tips and tricks for cleaner deep anal plays."

And I’m really just hungry. But I like anal, I enjoy it. 

But cleaning, eating carefully the day of, post clean up, even cutting out certain vegetables!?? It’s so much.

I usually like to cuddle with my boyfriend after. But after eating nothing but watermelon or soup the whole day, I’m immediately in the kitchen after. Sometimes, in the moment, I can’t help but think “wow. that pizza with extra cheese in the fridge is gonna taste *so good.*”

I’m sure my boyfriend appreciate it. But as a whole, anal is in huge demand as if prepping isn’t an hours long job. This is just my way of saying that if you want anal...it would be even sexier if you also had burritos waiting for them too."

I was thinking it might be a good idea to go on prep to ease my anxiety a bit but I wonder if I'm just being silly.  I know hiv is most common between men who have sex with men and that obviously isn't me so maybe it'd be weird of u took it bc the chances of me getting hiv anyway is lower.

I just moved into a new apartment and as anyone who’s bottomed knows the douching proccess isn’t quick or quiet at least when I do it.  (I shower and shave then douche). 

I can probably be in and out in 30-40 minutes but the sound of a bunch of water being shot out my ass into the toilet isn’t quiet.  Has anyone found any better ways to do this

I use an enema bulb but have noticed that im not clean after 2 flushes like I have been in the past this is my routine if anyone has suggestions 
1. Have gone to the bathroom that day and before any prep 
2. Fill up the bulb with warm water I will do 2 rinces back to back.. If necessary I will do a 3rd rinse 30 min to an hour after. and leave time for all the water to come out before any anal play. I also use soup amd water externally after the enemas."
