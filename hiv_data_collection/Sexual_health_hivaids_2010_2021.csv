My name is Arielle and I'm a queer researcher and relationship skills coach at Northwestern University. I want to give you guys some info about 2GETHER, a project we have going on for male couples.

2GETHER is a paid research study that involves a relationship education program-- where you and your partner can learn skills to strengthen your relationship, like improving your communication, sexual health and satisfaction. We have a national online program and an in-person program for people who live in Chicago.

There will be follow-up surveys and free at-home STI testing before and after the 2GETHER program. Because we're a university, all data we collect is protected by IRB and federal regulations. If you and your partner are eligible, you'll get to read over a consent form, which has more information about your privacy rights.

And obviously we're going to pay you for your time-- specifically $250 each for completing all parts of the study!

Want to find out if you qualify, or learn more? Check out our eligibility screener: [https://redcap.nubic.northwestern.edu/redcap/surveys/?s=YXKMW9JFXY](https://redcap.nubic.northwestern.edu/redcap/surveys/?s=YXKMW9JFXY)
