I have got back together with a guy I met a few months ago, and in the interim period he became positive. I am on PrEP, but I have only had condomless sex with others on PrEP. He's been on stribild for a few months, and I on PrEP for almost ten months, and we did have condomless sex (no ejaculation) a few times before he told me. 

He should have told me before, yes, but he knew I was on PrEP, and I knew what decision I was making too.

I am fairly sure my risk is quite low, especially if he is undetectable or nearly there. I have been perfectly adherent to my PrEP. We decided to switch over to condoms. Any thoughts or advice?"

I'm currently in a relationship with an HIV+ man with a non-zero VL. We've messed up and had unprotected several times, condoms have broke. I'm high risk.

Cipla is a generic manufacturer in India and produces a number of HIV medications near-cost. Officially they're only available in developing countries, but some Internet searching suggests it would be relatively easy to import for personal use here. Cipla's generic Truvada is $3 a pill in bulk. There are other manufacturers which may be even cheaper.

Then there's generic lamiduvine/zidovudine which is only $0.60 a pill in bulk, I know there's not as much evidence of its effectiveness and it isn't as easy on the body, but there's are strong reasons to believe it would work as PrEP.

I'm not looking for medical advice - I would consult with a doctor before seriously considering doing anything like this, and if I went with the imported Truvada I would have my doc do the routine checks, but I don't want to become HIV and I am exploring all my options.

Has anyone considered this? Has anyone done something like this? Is it infeasible for some reason I'm not foreseeing? Am I as insane as the small voice in my brain is saying?"

It looks like 10 monkeys were vaginally injected with with HIV that had the M184-V mutation. The 5 that were on PrEP were not infected while the remaining were. Apparently while this mutation makes the virus resistant to FDC, it also makes it extra-sensitive to tenofovir.

With me being on PrEP for 23 days, would I still be at risk of exposure? Some things to consider:

-Likelihood of HIV surviving on my skin after I pulled out
-Likelihood of HIV surviving during oral, even if it survived on skin, and getting into the cut
-Likelihood of full PrEP protection after 23 days (research only knows 7 days for rectal tissue, 20 for vaginal tissue (and some cite blood also))

I'm now very much considering to get onto regular PrEP treatments to prevent any potential HIV infection, even though my (still somewhat limited) understanding is, that the side effects are not insignificant and it's generally said, that the HIV infection risk is relatively low for heterosexual sex partners.

A bit of background: I'm single, 100% hetero, live in Southern Africa and got a fairly high sex drive and try to get all regular sex partners and me tested, whenever a lady with a chance for repeat encounters comes along, but sometimes I do unsafe sex with someone who only verbally confirmed to be negative, sometimes that person can be a prostitute (from the higher end of the market) and I only ever did unprotected anal once. So generally my behavior can be described as relatively risky (I'm not a stranger to abortions), but at a supposed HIV infection risk of 0.04% is still very low.

Now I found out, that there's PrEP and it's fairly affordable (R500 a month, ca. 35 US$), but is known for some side effects and I wonder, whether it's advisable to go down that route and how serious the implications are.

I still don't understand how the high prevalence of HIV in Southern Africa can be explained, when it's mostly the homosexual audience that's at risk, but maybe I just miss some important figures and someone can shed some light?

P.S. if you haven't heard of PrEP, /r/PrEPfacts is recommending this Introduction to PrEP: http://whatisprep.org or Personal experiences: http://myprepexperience.blogspot.com/"

When I asked him in person, he said the same thing that was on his profile while adding that he was tested Oct 9th and has been on Prep for 2 years straight now. I asked him to take a picture of his prep bottle when he got home for further proof that he's on prep and he did just that and it says Truvada 200/300mg on it.

I know everything makes it sound unlikely, but I'm just worried that he's lying about all of this. Like what if he contracted it between Oct and Dec and he missed days taking his prep? Any reason I should be worried? I've experienced very mild cold symptoms which is probably my sinuses since they act up regularly.

P.S - He says he doesn't like condoms which is why he wanted to bareback. I asked him if it was ok that we don't bareback anymore and he said he would be willing to have nonpenetrative sex with me in the future. I know I shouldn't be placing my trust in his hands so much, but he doesn't seem to harbor any suspicious intent. I'm just really anxious right now and haven't been sleeping right since.

The health body proposed a massive expansion of the trial that gives  at-risk groups access to Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) drug Truvada, [which can drastically reduce the risk](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/05/25/what-is-prep-side-effects/) of being infected with HIV if taken daily.

Sexual health charities had [warned that clinics are being forced to turn away](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/07/17/nhs-england-urged-to-roll-prep-drugs/) people  asking for PrEP, as the trial places allocated for men who have sex  with men rapidly ran out in some parts of the country.

According to the PrEP Impact trial [website](https://www.prepimpacttrial.org.uk/join-the-trial),  recruitment at 40 of the 135 trial centres is currently closed to gay  and bisexual men. All of the sites remain open for other groups,  including at-risk heterosexuals, trans men and trans women.

## NHS England: PrEP Impact trial uptake ‘exceeded initial expert predictions’

In a new [statement](https://www.england.nhs.uk/2019/01/update-on-the-prep-impact-trial/) on  Friday, NHS England backed calls to double the number of places on the  trial, making the HIV prevention pills available for a total of 26,000  people in England.

The initial trial had provided just 10,000 places, with a previous expansion taking the number of places available to 13,000.

NHS England said: “The speed of recruitment and demand for PrEP has significantly exceeded initial expert predictions.”

The body continued: “The trial researchers now consider that more places should be made available.

“They argue that recruitment needs to reach a ‘steady state’ in order  to ensure the trial can robustly and scientifically inform the design  and rollout of a full national programme in partnership with local  authorities.”

The decision is set to be approved by the trial’s Programme Oversight Board on January 15.

I've been in some high risk areas (Rio slums, Thai, Cambo, PI, Haiti, other places) - however I'm currently headed for Africa. 

Currently (and strangely), I've read many stories of high-risk guys finding a partner and then giving them an instant HIV test before having sex. This seems both expensive and inadequate as you have no idea what's happened in the last few weeks with the person and the serum level etc.. 

Not interested in a moral debate - just curious about the science. To protect myself and others. My doctor prescribed me Prep - advised I start taking it 20 days before travel and take it every single day religiously. 

With a 99%+ protection rate is there any reason one would be concerned about barebacking in Africa? I understand there are different strains - but the (very) few (I think 6 in total?) cases that PREP failed were do to individual mutations that made the persons strain immune to the combo.

So, if someone takes PREP as advertised, would they (statistically) be protected?

The morning I noticed I had soar throat, it was after waking up.

I woke up gasping for air. I noticed I had a slight soar throat and I touched my right neck and there was a slight pain. 

Could it be Strep Throat? or maybe I have swollen lymph node resulting in HIV? my last exposure to unsafe sex was May 5, ever since then I had like 3 HIV tests.

I took 3 days of doses, then I had sex with someone whose condom broke and who hadn’t been tested in 9 months. My blood was definitely involved too...

Will those 5 days I missed make me susceptible to getting HIV if he’s positive? I read it’s 7-20 days for it to start working. But I can’t find anywhere that says how long for Prep to leave the system or become useless.

My doctor started me on PEP this morning about 31 hours after the incident. Truvada (which I had been using for PrEP) and Isentress.

What if he has hiv and we have sex so many times that the medication doesn’t protect me from the hiv :/


&gt; What was strange about the 3rd and most recent case is that an older test returned HIV positive, while 2 newer tests returned HIV negative. The most reliable tools returned negative results. The man had a DIZZYING number of sex partners, and took every drug under the sun. They halted his PrEP to prevent a potential drug resistant strain to the virus. I don't know if this damned him or not.

When the newer tests finally came back positive, they were able to identify that the strain did not have prep-resistant mutations, which means theoretically it shouldn't have been able to get through.

My rudimentary understanding of science is that then you cohabitate with disease for long enough, it eventually takes hold - even if it's not technically supposed to. When the British didn't have proper sewer systems and swine, poultry, humans, and feces all occupied the same public space, the one in a million chance of an animal disease spreading to a human became a certainty.

This man's butthole was home to one million different loads on any given day, which means that it was eventually inevitable that something would break through. That's my take, anyway."

The paper, published online March 3 in the *Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved*, highlights the potential of integrating PrEP programs into public clinics that reach more patients with high HIV transmission risk but who often lack access to reliable health care.  

For the study, the research team surveyed 1,464 HIV-uninfected patients who visited two public Baltimore City Health Department clinics devoted to sexually transmitted diseases in 2016. Of the participants, only 18 percent, or 258 participants, reported prior knowledge of PrEP. Four percent (10 participants) were already using PrEP. Importantly, 46 percent of the 1,397 patients unfamiliar with PrEP, or 638 participants, indicated they were highly receptive to learning more about PrEP, with interest among the high-risk men having sex with men (MSM) patients even higher at 63 percent.

With on demand PreP, the guidelines say you should take an initial loading dose of 2 pills between 2 and 24 hours before any potential exposure. Does anyone know if this is equally effective if you took the two pills separated by a few hours (first one 7 hours before, second one 2 hours before)? While logically it seems it should, someone at a well regarded clinic suggested otherwise to me.

In that scenario, is it worth also taking RAL (Isentress) as PEP starting ~54 hours post exposure in addition to continuing Truvada? Or is a full PEP regime unnecessary here.

Thanks"

It’ll be over a month since I started dating this man who is HIV positive.

I saw his skepticism and worries through his eyes as he thought that I won’t accept him. I kissed him, and i said that I am well-informed, I accept him for whatever he is… My feelings for him became stronger. 

He’s been taking Biktarvy for a few months already. As a precaution, I asked my Doctor for a script for Descovy and will be taking as a preventative measure to lessen the risk of acquiring HIV. During a month of us dating, his viral load went up a little due to recent hospitalization. I haven’t had any intercourse with him since we started dating as I am still waiting for my prescription to be in-stock. 

My question is, if I am taking PrEp and he’s now undetectable, are we able to have unprotected sex (and him ejaculate inside or into the mouth and swallow)?

I  am HIV- but my partner is HIV+, we've been dating for a year now and  haven't done anything sexual. He mentioned he was HIV+ pretty early on  the relationship.

I am taking another medication for a condition I have, which unfortunately will interfere with PrEP (confirmed by doctor).

I've been getting conflicting information on U=U.

Does U=U mean untransmissible

* if  the person is on meds only? Either way, we will be using condoms, so  even if condoms aren't present, I virtually have no chance of catching  HIV from my partner?
* or if the person is on meds, and condoms and PrEP are used?

Thank you!"

 When I told him I am HIV+ ( 2 years and take Biktarvy every day and have never gone back to being detectable) and my monogamous boyfriend is HIV-, and that we don’t use condoms / he doesn’t take prep (he has severe gastro intestinal issues and PreP makes it worse) he treated me very rudely and said it was only a matter of time before my BF got HIV.

Is this true? Why would my doctor be saying this? Basic research says that U=U, and while I understand his due diligence as a doctor, was that really necessary? What do you guys think? Should my bf take PreP? Again I have never missed a Biktarvy dose and have been undetectable since I began treatment &amp; never been detectable"
