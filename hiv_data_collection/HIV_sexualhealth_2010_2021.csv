8oi95x,Extremely anxiety over possible HIV exposure,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualhealth/comments/8oi95x/extremely_anxiety_over_possible_hiv_exposure/,throwawayhair1999,4,2018-06-04 08:40:56,5,/r/sexualhealth/comments/8oi95x/extremely_anxiety_over_possible_hiv_exposure/,NaN,"Hi all,

Sorry if I sound ignorant or offensive in any way, my anxiety is just at an all new high and I need someone to talk to.

Im an 18 year old guy and 25 days ago, I was forced into giving an older man unprotected oral. It probably lasted for 10-15 seconds max (no ejaculation) until I pushed him off and stopped it all. I know some people may say oh you let it happen and all that but i just didn’t feel comfortable at all, so I wouldn’t say it was consensual. But I guess that’s besides the point.

My main issue is that ever since then, I’ve been worrying constantly whether I caught HIV. I don’t know the mans status and I know that the exposure wasn’t too long but I cant help but beat myself up over it. I feel guilty, angry, sad and helpless. Every day, I check whether I have any ARS symptoms but there’s been nothing that could definitely indicate seroconversion: I haven’t had a fever, night sweats or anything apart from a rash on my neck that was probably razor burn and lasted for two days. It has consumed my life for the past few weeks, I spend my days reading articles and stories about HIV and AIDS, which all just fuel my anxiety.

On top of that, I live in a small Arab country, so I could never get tested because that in itself is risky and raises too many questions. 

I’ve always had extreme anxiety, and come to think of it, a lot of it has been health anxiety. I remember thinking my droopy eye was a sign of something more than just a facial flaw. I’m aware of my irrationality, yet in this situation, it doesn’t seem completely unfounded - and because of that, I kill myself every day mentally. 

I don’t know if this post is appropriate, and I don’t really know what I’m asking. I guess the big question is, should I be worrying? I see so many conflicting opinions about oral sex that I cant allow myself to feel assured. What do you think my chances are that I did contract HIV?

Thank you."

But if he was, I gave him a handjob - I don’t see any visible cuts on my hand, but I do bite my nails a lot so the nail beds are exposed. Also, since we kinda kept switching positions and stuff, I think I might have touched my mouth or my eyes (after touching him) to try to move my hair out of the way. 
We were also French kissing, so there’s that and I touched my hickey (right after), he gave it to me while I was giving him the hand job. I also think I might have touched my mouth and lips before washing my hands ((accidentally!! I forgot)) because of a bruise he gave me on my lips. 

Anyways, am I at any level of risk of having contracted HIV through any of those scenarios?

Also, when I did wash my hands, all I could wash them with at his place was water. When I went to the washroom afterwards, I wiped off with my hands only having been washed with water.

a89mm0,Resources for Newly Diagnosed Individuals: Herpes (HSV) - HIV - AIDS - HPV - Asking to share,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualhealth/comments/a89mm0/resources_for_newly_diagnosed_individuals_herpes/,HonMyChest,1,2018-12-21 04:44:31,0,/r/sexualhealth/comments/a89mm0/resources_for_newly_diagnosed_individuals_herpes/,NaN,"Hi all - I host/produce the podcast, Something Positive for Positive People. This is a hub of sexual health resources that primarily consists of experiences of people living with, working with or affected by sexually transmitted infections/diseases. I'm unable to share this resource in many places that make sense as it is spam/self-promotion when I do it. Despite the importance of this information, places don't really care to have me 'talking about my podcast' on their platforms which I understand.

So I wanted to bring it here. This podcast is an emotional and mental support resource for people who get an STI and then get some pills and a pamphlet then sent on their way just as I was 6.5 years ago after my herpes diagnosis. It took me 5 years to find communities of others living with the virus. Those resources are challenging to find and I want people to be able to find them way sooner than I did. 

I share this here in hopes that someone who needs this sees it, and in hopes that the people who are comfortable sharing will do so before it's removed for self promotion because there are people who become suicidal and fall into depression just because they don't see past the present moment of their diagnosis and their feelings about it. 

I post episodes each week, there's 73 to date and the resources consist of people's experiences navigating relationships and dating, disclosing, managing herpes outbreaks, living with HIV, AIDS, access to support groups, sexual health facilities and organizations for condoms and STI treatment in addition to some bomb ass sex positive people to follow on social media.

I believe in this work I do and I've done it for more than a year now. The biggest challenge is that people don't want to share due to the fact they fear others assuming they have an STI because they share this information. In reality we ALL know someone living with an STI, we just don't know it. I believe this podcast is destigmatizing that through these experiences and resources being shared and it can contribute more if I'm able to show people with herpes that they do have a support system around them that is supportive and not critical/judgmental of them. This is my attempt to get people who don't have herpes/HIV involved by just sharing this to show support from the non-sti positive community.

Thank you everyone. And I'm gonna stay positive and hope for the best. . . . I don't have a choice to do otherwis haha."

A few months ago I broke up with my now ex, with which I had unprotected vaginal sex a few times. He pulled out most of the time but once he didn't. It has been three months since the last time I had sex.

He insisted that he was clean - the people he was with before either were virgins, or were tested and were clean, and he said he was 100% confident that he is clean too. He is also the only person I have been with sexually.

I wanted to get a test done for STD's in general just for peace of mind and to get my mind off of things, but I was dumb and started looking at symptoms online. I saw that you could get flu-like symptoms - and I had a bad cold during exams in mid October (I got a cold after exams in December as well, so I know it's stress). I also saw that you could get warts or folliculitis, but I already had folliculitis, and I have been getting the occasional wart here and there ever since I was a kid. I also know that these are symptoms that are more aggressive in HIV patients so they would be more severe and would crop up later on - not 3-4 months later. 

It's consumed my life ever since I looked it up. I'm so so anxious and I don't know what to do. 

I know I shouldn't have had unprotected sex even though he assured me he was clean, but there was some emotional manipulation. Still, it's my fault. 

I'm getting tested on Monday, but I just wanted to post here to see my chances / ease my mind. "

I am extremely worried about potentially having HIV. I know the chances are very low but it plays on my mind every single day.  


I had a one night stand without a condom, 6 weeks later I got an STI/blood test and everything was negative. The worker at the clinic told me I do not have to come back, as after 4 weeks a HIV Test is accurate, and that you would only have to come back if you took PrEP before which I didnt.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been told I am negative but the anxiety still haunts me, mainly because I have read online you must get retested at 3months/12 weeks.

I didn’t cum inside it and soon became terrified because I don’t really know the back ground or what company created it, all I know is it was shipped from China.
Is there any possible chance of catching STDs or HIV from the toy in the unlikely event that someone had used it before it was sent to me?

I have bad oral hygiene, my gums are inflammed and bleed a little whenever i brush. The girl i gave oral to also had a copperish taste down there so i assume she could have been in a menstruating cycle.

Ive heard to contract the disease that the blood of the infected person has to go into the bloodstream of the other. Everything ive researched has said it is possible to become hiv+ through giving oral but it is very very low. Given my circumstances with my teeth i assume my chances are much higher.

The girl i gave oral to was when i went to Turkey, she was an escort and im pretty sure a drug user (meth) from the look of her teeth, she also had tattoos. She was actually quite thick and and didnt look sickly thin so thats was a good sign. I went down on her for 20 minutes non stop and for the sex i used a condom.

2 months later and i think im getting symptoms. I noticed 4 days ago my tongue was white and i went to my doctor and he confirmed i had oral thrush, a possible explanation other than hiv could be that i wasnt brushing my teeth and was reusing my retainer without washing it every night.

Other symptoms i have been getting is heart burn, penis stinging, muscle aches, loss of appetite and hot pee. The first 4 symptoms can be explained due to be anxiety i have gotten from this predicament but im not sure if its all in my head. I have to wait another month to get tested for hiv and in the mean time im getting tested for other stis which i will get the results soon. So given my situation is it safe to say theres a high chance i could have received hiv from oral? Or is it still a very low chance?"

Two weeks ago I was in bed with this girl I met not too long before that. I wasn't able to get hard, but there was a point when she was on top and try to get me hard and put it in. It didn't get inside but it did rub up on the outside while she was on top and in missionary. There wasn't any penis to vagina contact after that.

**Symptoms**

* A day ago I walk into work and my butt is itching/burning, I go to the bathroom to wipe and there's a full stain as if I finished using the toilet. Gone away since.
* Waking up feeling uncharacteristically really low-energy
* Joints are in pain
* Not really a cold but the sniffles, slight throat pain too

I look these up and the symptoms are identical to HIV symptoms

I feel like I sound like a crazy person, but is it possible to get an STD from basically no intercourse. If I'm being an idiot please let me know.

Though because I couldn’t draw enough blood for the hiv sample I couldn’t get my hiv results so I will have to go to a clinic. I had a mild cold 2 weeks later after the blowjob but it went but now I have another cold now but with a fever .I know these are often symptoms expressed from a person who have recently contracted hiv from direct sexual contact and it’s kind of hovering in my head atm.

They said they only had a flu for 1-2 weeks and got better without any meds, and no other symptoms. It was also flu season. 

1) is it true that HIV transmission through oral is highly unlikely unless there are cuts or something? I’ve had unprotected oral sex with several male partners bc I thought it was not an issue

2) the person I’m concerned with here is a female, and I went down on her so what are the transmission rates for that?

3) I’ve only had protected sex and the condom was used properly and there were no holes or anything, so should I be scared that I got it through this?

I’m just scared bc this was sudden and it’s been like 9 months, now everything strange that happens to my body I connect it to possibly hiv 
I had a white layer on my tongue for a bit but it cleared up and I had a few yeast infections but I used some cream and it hasn’t been back in a while

But to help me relax I wanted to ask these questions.

I'm transgender mtf but a virgin for the most part. I still have never had sex with a woman or anal, but a few days ago I hooked up with another mtf girl who was a virgin in many ways but has had oral preformed on her. So I mainly gave her head, tried her precum, and she ate me out. She didn't ejaculate in my mouth and we didn't do any anal. 

&amp;#x200B;

She's also young--20, and I'm 23, and we're both inexperienced so I'm assuming she doesn't have HIV. Nonetheless I'm paranoid. What are the odds of getting it from the activities I mentioned? I should shave that I had shaved my legs and had several nicks there that had dried up, but one was recent and  had sealed. She didn't get any semen directly on those wounds--or atleast I think--but if she did, what is the risk of HIV transmission? Can HIV transmit from semen to a small wound created by a shaving nick or does it seal quickly enough? How big does the wound have to be?"

I've hooked up before--only oral--with her and she said she gets tested frequently and is clean, and I also got tested last month and everything is good. Now, she wanted me to top her, and she started to put my dick near her rectum and kinda pressing into it. I don't really know if I was in at all or not--we were both kinda drunk--but it was definitely pressing at her entrance. Again she didn't make a noise and I didn't really feel anything but I got nervous and said I didn't want to top her (I've never topped anyone). We did oral after that but now I'm worried she has HIV and I might have gotten it from that.

So my questions are this. How deep do you have to be while topping to get HIV? Is it possible that I may have been exposed? And should I do PEP?"

He only had sex with one other girl before me and she was kinda -sorry, but- loose. And he pretty much sucked. Maybe that's why I am kind of obsessing over the amount of STDs he gave me. 

I know it is better being safe than sorry at any time but getting that test in this city... The amount of judgement would be unbearable. Also, I love the guy I am with now. He would be devastated, he cannot handle it. I cannot handle -somewhat- having caused that. I chose that shitty guy (I am not saying you are shitty if you have HIV, god no, he just sucked so bad, I gotta mention it in every other sentence), I had the unprotected sex, this good loving person shouldn't suffer for it.

What I am saying is, do the high levels of lymphocyte strongly suggest HIV? Or what is the probability of getting it?

Hey there Redditors  . Can i share to you about hiv-related thing ?  . 

So on February 17 i got an unprotected anal intercourse and after that hiv crossed my mind . After that i’ve been dealing with anxiety and stress about hiv , so maybe around 3 1/2 weeks later (8 march ) i went to a private hospital and talk about my case with a specialist and he told me that lets get you tested , the test was anti hiv rapid which taken from my vein and sent to a lab to get the results and it went back negative . And my doc said that i should came back a month after which is april 17 for future confirmatory testing with more sensitive test . So i went crazy while waiting for a month , i begin dealing with anxiety , and feel like im sick all the time , and my heart just racing cant go to sleep nightmares all day . So the second test finally came , i got back to the hospital get tested , the test is little bit pricey around $120 basically the test was 3 method test . The test was CMIA , ECLIA , and i can’t remember the third test it came back all negative , the test results was sent to my doctors office and he said its alright youre good , the virus is not there , its been 2 month and the most sensitive test can’t detect it . So i kinda relieved but not fully , u know what i mean , theres still worries with that , So i keep dealing with anxiety until today , and finally last week i got sick , i got a fever , and my joints are aching but it only lasted for 1 day . I woke up the next i was completely fine . But now im dealing with sore throat , finally I went back to my doc he said that ur just too stressed so u get sick easily , i dont know how to cope with these . Maybe if you previously have someone similarly talked about this to you maybe do u have any tips on this . 

Really i want my life back 
Timeline : 
17th february (possible exposure) 
8 march (1st test - rapid )
17 april (cmia , eclia , )

I don’t know whether this guy is HIV positive or not, as I didn’t ask but we used protection during sex i’m just concerned about the oral sex. Thanks"

We’re both 23 and i do not know her previous relationships, but she was always wanted to use condoms so I know that she was always like this. One day, we were making out and i was getting down on her. The lights were out so could not see clearly. As i was doing it, i tasted blood in my mouth so i stopped and realised that she was on her period I might have swallowed my saliva I’m not certain but it is plausible. After that i kinda got scared so i stopped. She never mentioned any diseases or STDs. Since she was someone who took care of her health, i did not pay too much mind to it except couple days of paranoia. I haven’t felt any symptoms at all or nothing i can recall or too serious to seek medical attention. Except one little swelling behind my tooth but it could also be due to my dental braces. There wasn't any ulcers. ( fever, flu symptoms, rush, anything of sorts). I also remember an acne like lump under my left armpit but I’m not sure when it happened exactly so, it could’ve happened prior to the indicident. I thought that it was an acne since I’m prone to have them and it went away after a week or so if I’m not wrong and never came back. It wasn’t red or too big just a bit sensitive like any other acne. I had no other lymph node swelling either not that i can recall at least.  Apart from that, I remember that my legs were hurting (could be just one) during the night before I go to sleep. It wasn't too intense and the pain was only in my legs it wasn't persistent either it could've been just for a handful of times. It felt like restless leg pain. I thought that the reason behind it was my lack of exercise due to covid as I excerise daily.  After we seperated, she moved to Italy to study so i don’t talk to her atm.  When I read the old messages I came across one me saying that I couldn't sleep and woke up couple times with a little sweat, but it was probably a bad dream because I didn't get any other similar night.  However, something triggered this thought in my and i can’t stop thinking about it. Is there a possibility of infection? I know the only way to find out is to get tested but I’m scared to get it and hospitals are not in a good shape where i live. Apart from HIV, i didn’t have other STD symptoms either. We actually never had actual penetration with or without a condom due to my psychological erectile issues. Could you give your thoughts on this? Thank you in advance."

I had same sex mutal masturbation with another man yesterday. I used the same hand which I used to rub his genital to rub mine. I got some precum. Just worried if my hand got his precum also, can HIV virus be transmitted to my body by my hand (with his precum on it)? Do I need to take PEP?

Thank you."

In March I had unprotected sex with a guy that I had been talking to for a few months. He told me that hadn’t had sex with anyone else since his ex girlfriend in august. I had believed him but soon found out that was not true.  After the sex i was bleeding a little bit and my cervix felt swollen. 2 days later I had some yellow discharge and pain and it looked like my lymph nodes near my vaginal entrance were swollen. I didn’t think anything of it because I thought I just had bacterial vaginosis and couldn’t have an Std because i had believed him when he said he’s clean and hasn’t had sex since his ex . It then went away 2 days later but I continued to get this for the next 2 times I had sex with him in May. 

Fast forward to June and now I have swollen lymph nodes on my neck, back of my neck, behind my knees, and my armpits. I am freaking out. What are the chances that I have hiv? 

I asked him yesterday if he’s clean and he said he is and I asked him how is he sure of that and he never responded.

I would like to add that I am a female and he is a male"

She wasn't very hygienic. She never tested for HIV but she assumes that she's negative since she only has sex with condoms.

Exposure:-
- We kissed but then I realized I had cuts inside my mouth and gums. Likely got it after brushing my teeth. Is it possible to get HIV through this way?
- I fingered her and sucked her breasts and kissed her neck. I don't know if I saw a sore on her neck. How likely is it to get HIV if I kissed a sore?
- After fingering her, she sat on my lap and my penis might have touched her vagina. Maybe my tip and head touched the outside of her vagina but I'm certain there wasn't any penetration. Can I get HIV through this way?
- She performed Oral on me with a condom on.
- We had protected sex for just a minute or two since I was worried and this made me flaccid. I put it in twice and had to pull out within a minute as I was flaccid.
- The condom didn't completely cover my penis since the condom was small. It covered the head of my penis but didn't fully reach down to the base of my penis. But I had no cuts on the lower end of my penis. The lower end of the penis was the part that wasn't fully covered. Can i get HIV this way?
- I then masturbated with the condom on for like 2-3mins. I think by touching the condom, I had the vaginal fluids, and after removing the condom, I accidentally held on to my penis. Can the vaginal fluids transmit from my hand to the penis and cause HIV this way?

I've been sick since the 3rd day of exposure. Today is the 5th week and I'm still sick. I don't know if I'm going through seroconversion now. I either get new symptoms or my existing symptoms get worse.

My symptoms are as follows:-
- Headache
- Extreme Joint pain (knees, elbows, feet, fingers)
- Swollen lymph nodes (behind the ear, neck, groin)
- Sore throat (reddish bumps behind the throat and swollen tonsils)
- Extreme Fatigue
- Stiff Neck
- Chest pain
- Dry Mouth and White tongue
- Mouth Ulcers
- Occasional Nausea and Diarrhea(not very loose)
- Muscles Aches (back, hand, legs etc)
- Abdomen pain
- Sharp lower back Pain
- Lower abdomen and groin pain
- Feet going numb at times
- Burning while urinating and urethral pain(not very frequent)

I don't know what's happening. I don't know if stress is causing these symptoms. But I feel tired and sick. I was healthy before and got sick after my exposure.

Assuming she was HIV+, what would be my risk if you ignore the symptoms?

PS. It's hard to consult a doctor and get tested here in the Middle East If im likely to have an STD. So please do assess my risk and let me know. I would then travel to get tested."

I read online that you have to wait 10-14 days until a HIV test is reliable, but is it possible to get a HIV test with a result a few days earlier? I just want to make sure before I have sex with anyone else again."
