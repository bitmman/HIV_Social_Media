**Last year, more than 12,000 people walked with us to raise awareness for the cause. We invite you to walk with your friends, family, co-workers, neighbors, or alongside the thousands of other members of our community who come together to show their support.**

Every donation counts, no matter the amount.

Although medical advances have improved and prolonged many people's lives over the last few decades, the need for AFAN's services continues to be crucial. In 1984, the founders of AFAN did not imagine that there would still be a need to advocate for our clients 30 years later. So much has been accomplished of which we should all be proud, yet as we know, there is still much to be done.  Your support, hard work and generosity will allow us to continue our mission.

Date

Sunday, May 4, 2014

Location

University of Nevada Las Vegas

Walk activities begin in front of the Student Union


Here is my fundraising page...all donations go directly to AFAN, not me. Last year was a lot of fun. I was surprised and a bit overwhelmed at the support given last year, this year promises to be even better! Please click on my link to help me in my fundraising efforts, and I invite you to participate in this years walk.

I've finally seen an ID specialist, we're waiting on genotyping results to check for drug resistance and I'll start a regime hopefully next week.  I also have PCP which I've started taking cotrimoxazole for... not the nicest drug ever.

Doc said that with my numbers and the pneumonia, that there's a decent chance I could die before my immune system recovers while on HAART.  Maybe he's just trying to scare me into complying with my drugs and appointments (I missed the first one... stupid stupid).  Either way, fun fun.

If there's anyone else out there who's avoiding treatment, my advice?  Get yo' ass to a doctor.

More than anything else, I'm just so disappointed in myself."

I was diagnosed about 9 months ago and have been trying to get back into dating (*actually was before my diagnosis*) and since then have been exploring the sites out there that are designed for us POZ folks. I put together a quick Imgur [preview list here](http://imgur.com/a/2QyRO) which gives you an idea of 9 that come up in Google searches all the time. If you've used them or if you just look at the image previews of their home page I just linked I think you'll get an idea of what I'm about to talk about.

**What I've found has been (IMO) wholly disappointing. Here are my reasons:**

**1)** Nearly all of them look really old and lack features you expect in a modern dating site. Some of them were even created in the late 90's and don't look like they have been updated since then. I could only find one that actually has a native iOS app and none with an Android app? Hello? People have been downloading apps to their phones since 2007!

**2)** Some kind of look scammy. For example Positives Dating, HIV People Meet and Positive Singles all look the same (*again old*) but they all say they have been featured in the same media outlets. I realize they might look the same because they are using the same back-end software but when you start making claims that you have all been featured in the same media outlets, etc. I think you are probably just making shit up. Why would I want to buy a membership to that? 

**3)** Here comes where I think I'm going to create some controversy next. There are no strong hookup apps out there. Let's face it people like to have NSA sex and that is exactly why Grindr, Tinder, etc. are all extremely popular. I feel that positive people should have all the same stuff as everyone else. 

I was trying to explain this to a friend and the only way I could put it was like this... with us POZ folk there is a moment where ""**the question**"" comes up or whatever you'd like to call it. That moment of truth where we have to disclose our status and wonder for 30 seconds if that's going to be a go or not. Explaining it to my friend I said something like:

&gt; *""it would just be really nice to have a POZ friendly hookup app where I didn't have to explain to someone my status because we are all either POZ, POZ friendly, on PrEP or whatever but the important piece is everyone using the site/app knows that going in so it moves a layer of pressure. We can take a collective sigh of relief because we know going in to the app/site that barrier is taken down.""*

**HUGE DISCLAIMER:** I am by no means saying this is an excuse to not disclose status.

**But... instead of just bitching... I have a potential solution:**

1) I'm a software guy, I've been working in tech for a long time and I know how to build this stuff. It's probably part of why I'm so frustrated with what is out there. I know it can be better. I'm half considering building a new app/site in my downtime which addresses the items I mentioned above.

The reason why I wrote all this out is I want to get a litmus check. Am I being realistic in my complaints? If I took the amount of time to build something new (*it wouldn't be trivial*) do you think other people would use it? Do you have other complaints not listed here that I should think about if I do this? 

Lastly... if I'm wrong and I'm missing a really awesome site PLEASE TELL ME where it is so I can start talking to my future boyfriend. :-)

Any advice or guidance from the community would be very much appreciated. 

**tl;dr: Dating sites for positive people suck and I think I might want to try and fix that.**"

Thousands still die every year. I keep my mouth shut most of the time. I did correct a nurse who was teaching an HIV education class I had to sit in on today. I just could not believe a health care worker saying people do not die from HIV/AIDS anymore. No one I knew in my 20's and early 30's is alive today and that colors my thinking. I am trying to figure out if I am just too sensitive to the statement?  Since 2004 I went years without knowing anyone with HIV/AIDS die because of the disease. But in 2014 I saw 1 friend die and I am watching 2 that unless a new medication come out that will not see 2017. So I know it still kills.

These discussions in /r/HIVAIDS are valuable, but as the most recent HIV study represented (a study that showed that mixed couples don't transmit HIV, something that mixed couples have reported anecdotally for decades), we must have a place to discuss things that lead science to their conclusions besides simply being clinical and telling people that NO you're NOT HIV+. We need a place to be public, and be aggressive about our reaction to discrimination towards those with HIV and counteract those times and places.
Please consider joining and contributing.

I decided to name the subreddit after the name of the famous reactionary group in NYC during the AIDS crisis because of their action and advocacy. If it's a terrible idea, then we can try a different approach with a same idea but a different name, and let me know.

While I've seen many reports about AIDS-related deaths, is it possible for HIV to be the primary cause of death if it never turns into AIDS?

57rmri,Undergrad thesis research on HIV and AIDS; Looking for sources!,https://www.reddit.com/r/hivaids/comments/57rmri/undergrad_thesis_research_on_hiv_and_aids_looking/,bagelshopped,2,2016-10-16 07:27:21,1,/r/hivaids/comments/57rmri/undergrad_thesis_research_on_hiv_and_aids_looking/,NaN,"Hi everyone. So I'll start off by saying I almost never post on Reddit and have only been looking through this subreddit for a couple days. My name is Paul Struck, and I'm a 21-year-old journalism major/political science minor at Roger Williams University in Bristol, RI USA. I'm writing my senior thesis on HIV/AIDS as well as their impact on the gay community. I'll be researching the history of the virus, the 1980s epidemic and the politics of the time, and the current state of affairs including the disease's relationship with methamphetamine addiction among gay men.

I'm looking for someone in the Connecticut/Massachusetts/Rhode Island area, preferably a gay man in his 20s who is HIV positive that I could meet up with and speak to maybe a couple times over the course of this fall. Essentially, I'm looking for a ""face"" for my story. If you even somewhat fit this description or knows someone who does and would like to speak with me, let me know! I would like to get to know you and learn about what an HIV positive life has meant for you. This would be in addition to interviews I have with public health officials and activists, etc.

My goal in doing this is to localize my story which is clearly a national issue, and to get a more intimate perspective on life with HIV in the 21st century. This may include obstacles you've faced such as finances, medical complications and general social stigma. However, it may also include triumphs. It would add a credible and authentic voice to my piece which will be of a long form, Wall Street journal-style journalistic nature. 

I've grown passionate about this topic in the past year or so, and knew that I wanted to write about it this fall. I feel it would bring awareness to an issue that many people believe is behind us, and it would give a voice to those who don't feel they have been heard. If anyone has ANY questions, comments or suggestions relating to how I may find someone to speak to, I encourage you to get in touch with me! If you want to personally contact me and don't want to comment on this, you can reach me at my email...

pstruck767@g.rwu.edu

Or my phone number! 8604025513

I hope this post is seen and I hope I hear from some of you! If you've read this far then thank you so much for your time and I hope to really make some good progress with this in the coming days! 😁"

I live in Texas, I'm gay and have AIDS. I almost died 3 years ago while at University Hospital. The biggest problem I had was I was showing no symptoms at all. By the time I arrived at the hospital I had a CD4 count of 2! I am concerned that people do not take this disease seriously. People are dying every day from this condition and I believe it's important to remind people AIDS is a deadly disease. As an older gay man I know and have heard gay teens either give the disease to each other or think there's a cure and there is no cure. So I'm planning to produce a documentary about my condition and AIDS and how terrible it can be. Below is a rough video I plan to release to help raise money for this documentary. Thank you...

Q: Britain’s Time Out declared animal rights the number one hip cause on the planet, eclipsing AIDS and homelessness. What do you think of that?

A: [Sarcastic] Hip hip hooray. I don’t think you can call any movement more “hip” than AIDS. But anything you get involved in, there’s just one rule I have and it’s about focus. There are so many animal rights issues I could deplete myself in one week. I’ve really had to choose. In the last year I’ve been working on a “Free the Elephants” campaign, not through PETA. It’s the Performing Animal Welfare Society in California. Hopefully we can get these animals out of the traveling shows and circuses. It’s all about re-educating the public to redefine the word “entertainment.”

Q: Some doctors say that animal research helped lead to the discovery of the AIDS virus.

A: I don’t believe in any animal testing. There are other ways. You don’t have to be an animal rights activist, you just have to care about one word: injustice. What right does man have to use the “lesser creatures”? Animals are great teachers. They taught me to be the mother I’m becoming, because I’ve brought up so many animals in my life."

Normally I wouldn't give this a second thought as I'm educated and I know that HIV cannot be spread by casual contact.

However, a memory from six months ago came to mind. During our trip to India, when my daughter was a year old, we visited an orphanage for children with HIV and AIDS. There were about 40 children. My daughter played with them and she shared some snacks with them. At this stage, she was also teething and mouthing (putting objects in her mouth). 

She picked up a cold from one of the children which lasted a month, but after that she was fine. Also, she hasn't gained any weight in six months (literally only 500 grams) but this could be due to her being more active as a toddler.

I went to visit my doctor who wants me to do a blood test. He did say that the possibility was remote. 

Should I put my daughter through the agony of a blood test? Two people will need to hold her arm down while they try to find the vein and poke around to draw blood. It would be traumatizing for her.

Is the blood test worth the trauma? Is there a real risk she could have HIV?"

He's been like this before, around 8 years ago. He recovered with treatment (which he wouldnt tell us about). This time, it's all happening again, and it's been going on for about 8 months.

He refuses to tell me anything beyond the fact that it is related to his immune system. 

I don't know if it's fear, embarrassment, or trying to protect me (I'm a grownass adult in my 30s) but he won't talk to me or my mom.

I have so many questions. Can he recover with treatment, or is he dying? What treatments does he need? What is it like to be going through this?  Has he been seeing someone other than my mom? Will mediCare cover this? What kind of care does he need? What are we supposed to do when he has these crazy fevers? Why won't he talk to me?

Being vocal was never meant to be about me. I don't need pity. I became vocal because after 7 years of being positive, I realized I wasn't doing my part. On World AIDS Day 2017, I want to see 0 new infections. I want to see 0 AIDS-related deaths. I want to see an end to discrimination. Do you? 

If so, YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE, DONATE HERE (100% of proceeds go to Equality California, AIDS Project LA &amp; Rape Abuse National Network)--$5, $10, $20, $50, $100 plus--it all adds up and you can do it anonymously, if that's what you'd prefer:

So much for undetectable = un-infectious. What is up with all this fear-mongering? If you're HIV-positive and are undetectable, the risks of you infecting your partner are nonexistent. Rather than give into ignorance and fear, why don't folks empower themselves with science and facts? 

Now more than ever, we need to stand tall and fight to end the continued denigration of those who are living with HIV/ AIDS. Anyone else figuring out ways to be more active? Would love to hear about them!"

1. Can AIDS be developed? What I mean is, a flu is a virus and even though you have not been in contact with anyone who has a flu there is still a chance you can get it via body stress, fatigue, etc etc. So in that same sense can AIDS be developed even tho you have not been in contact with anyone that has AIDS?

2. Can girls who taste their own jizz get AIDS by doing that? I understand that AIDS is a sexually transmitted disease so if the girl doesn’t have AIDS can she gain it by doing that?

Thanks for having the time to answer the questions."

HIV and AIDS has come such a long way and the stigma and discrimination against it is no where near what it used to be. They're just jokes! It's o.k to laugh. Boy was I wrong. Now that the tables have turned, I feel like a complete asshole for the way I use to think. These episodes I once found harmless are now unbelievably cringe worthy. They're embarrassing and hurtful and I only see that now because I'm apart of it whereas before, I wasn't. I thought the stigma and discrimination against people with this virus was gone. It's not. It's horrible, the things we have to go through and put up with. The fear and disgust associated with having it. Nobody knows my secret. I was watching TV the other day and this episode of Family Guy came on and everyone noticed I wasn't laughing, because I was the only one :-/ I was so uncomfortable and I tried to play it off by saying I had a lot on my mind. Now, I'm hoping and praying nobody connects the dots. I just wanted to share that with you guys. So much has changed for me and the humor I once had for these kind of jokes are completely gone.

The issue is that WAD really doesn’t seem to...well...focus on anyone actually living with HIV.  There’s a particular neglect of people diagnosed after HAART.

You get plenty of advocacy for prevention as you always do... PrEP users spelling our “PrEP” with their pills on social media and taking pictures of themselves tossing back a Truvada while smiling.

You also get plenty of talk about the bad old days.  The 22 years ago of this 37 year old epidemic when this disease was a certain and horrible death sentence.

What you don’t see is anyone actually living with HIV-particularly people diagnosed since ‘96.  You don’t hear our concerns about healthcare or our frustrations.  No mention of U=U.  And after 8 years of this, I know what WAD is going to be;

“Experts day we can eradicate aids once and for all, if we can only increase usage of the new wonder drug PrEP”.

Well, no, it’s certainly not going to be an eradication for those of us who already have it.

Am I alone in this sentiment?  TBH I don’t think so.  But what I do think is that we need to start coming forward and acknowledging our frustration that “World Aids Day” has absolutely nothing to do with people who actually have HIV."

**How is HIV transmitted:**

Perinatal transmission — it is a hereditary transmission from a mother can transmit [HIV](https://jacobspublishers.com/jacobs-journal-of-aids-hiv/) to her child during childbirth, pregnancy, and also it is through breastfeeding. 

Blood transmission —it is a risk of transmitting HIV through blood transfusion is extremely low in developed countries. However, among people who inject drugs, sharing and reusing syringes contaminated with HIV-infected blood is an extremely hazardous common way of transmission. 

Sexual transmission — this transmission can happen when there is contact with infected sexual fluids like rectal, genital, and oral mucous membranes of the affected person. It can happen while having sex without a condom, including vaginal, oral, and anal sex. The sharing sex toys with someone who is HIV-positive Also transfer the virus.

**Symptoms**

Next, coming to the symptoms of HIV infection. The result of infections caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites. These reasons do not normally develop in individuals with healthy immune systems, which is protect the body against infection. The early symptoms of HIV infection are identifying generally. Most of the people with HIV infection have no symptoms until several months and even years after contracting the virus in the body. Moreover, around 80 percent may develop symptoms similar to flu for 2–6 weeks after catching this virus-This is called acute retroviral syndrome. 

The symptoms of early HIV infection may include: 

&amp;#x200B;

* joint      pain
* muscle      aches
* a sore throat
* sweats      (particularly at night)
* enlarged      glands
* a      red rash
* tiredness
* weakness
* unintentional      weight loss
* fever
* thrush
* fever      chills

This is important to kept mind that these symptoms appear when the body is fighting off many types of viruses or not just HIV virus. If you have some of these symptoms in your body. Then believe that you could have been at risk of contracting HIV in the last few weeks, you can take a test immediately."

I have herpes and had a live podcast recording at an event and had to check someone who misspoke about HIV and let them know about U=U and I felt so confident doing so. Someone thanked me and it felt good to just know this info.

Anyways, reaching out because this latest episode of the podcast could use some feedback. As members of the hivaids subreddit, I hope to get a handful of people to advise me on this interview to let me know if I am going about this correctly and doing all I can to positively shift stigma around HIV. 

I interview a nonprofit in my hometown that provides resources to people who are HIV/AIDS+. St. Louis Effort for AIDS is the organization, and I interviewed the VP of Operations about their services. I got tested for HIV and syphilis, ghonnorea and chlamydia as well. The experience was fantastic.

So to make sure my approach is welcomed by the community, I ask that you listen (and leave a review if you want this to get out to more people) and let me know what you like about this and what could be better.

I’ve been told that once you are diagnosed with AIDS, in the medical community, you are considered to always have AIDS regardless of whether your immune system recovers, are undetectable etc.

Is this true? And if so is there a logical reason for this? Or just some outdated misnomer that still pervades and has been unchecked? It would seem a disservice, especially given all the advancements in treatment, to continue referencing someone like myself as having AIDS. I’ve been undetectable for 4+ years and am very healthy."

I'm not sure what my cd4 counts are or what they were when I was diagnosed, but my doctor said upon my diagnosis that based on my numbers I was likely infected years ago. If I had to trace it back, I would say possibly between 2013 and 2015. One thing that has concerned me greatly is when I started reading about opportunistic infections.

What prompted getting tested was when I was being treated for non-hodgkins lymphoma. I was admitted to the hospital for pneumonia, which was what prompted the tests. My doctors confirmed that it was related to HIV. I also noticed I had developed oral thrush a short time later and in May was diagnosed with shingles in addition to having chronic night sweats. I have read that the lymphoma and everything I mentioned were signs that my HIV had reached the final stage and become aids. To know for sure I'm sure I would need to know my cd4 count but I was wondering if anyone can confirm what I've read.

In January I started taking biktarvy but unfortunately as of two weeks ago my insurance ran out and have not been able to refill my prescription, which worries me if my HIV has advanced the where I believe it has. I've noticed recently that I've been developing blotches on my nose/forehead and arms. I have my doctors appointment in about a week so I'm hoping to get these questions answered 100%"

We will be interviewing doctors and researchers about HIV and wanted to ask you guys some questions to figure out what people want to learn about HIV and AIDs. We have some questions below, but definitely feel free to expand on them (or only answer the ones you think are relevant to you).  


1. What is it like to date as an HIV positive person?
2. How has being HIV positive affected your outlook on life?
3. What are some myths about HIV that you wish people were better educated about?
4. What's the hardest part about living with HIV?  


We're also looking to have a short 10-15 minute phone call with someone living with HIV in order to get a better understanding of how being HIV positive affected your life. This can be totally anonymous if you would prefer (just comment or dm, or email us at [hashtaghealthpodcast@gmail.com](mailto:hashtaghealthpodcast@gmail.com) if you would be willing to help!)  


Thanks to everyone who replies or reaches out -- we really appreciate it!"

The joke was neither funny nor particularly notable and the actor himself probably benefitted from making it, as “there’s no such thing as bad publicity”.  Particularly when you’re as washed up as this dude is.

He was predictably slammed by everyone.  Because ”we can’t have serophobia”.  Or at least we can’t have anything that is obvious serophobia.

Except this joke wasn’t even the worst thing I’ve heard about HIV this week.  It was just...what everyone felt comfortable attacking.  It’s as if we don’t have the balls to call out the fact that gay dating platforms allow people to identify as and search for terms like “DDF”, so instead we’ve channeled all our anger and frustration against this pathetic shit weasel.  We seem to do this a lot-we’re afraid to take on the big issues and so we go for the small stuff.  We go after it viciously.

I fucking hate this about the community of people living with HIV.  It’s not just that we don’t seem to know who our real enemies are, it’s that we don’t even seem to care to consider the issue.  So we don’t ever talk about the big stuff.  We just freak out over some idiot who stepped in it on Twitter."

# Updated: Blacks and the Spread of HIV/AIDS

📷

**Update 12/26/2019:** Since this was first published, many more specific cases of blacks knowingly spreading HIV/AIDS have been brought to my attention. They have been added to the chronological list below. Thanks to everyone who helped me put together this list.

Eastern and Southern African nations have [higher rates](https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/sub-saharan-africa/overview) of [HIV/AIDS](https://www.amren.com/tag/aids/) than the rest of the world. Blacks in the [United States](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/racialethnic/africanamericans/index.html) also have higher infection rates than non-whites. Many migrants from sub-Saharan Africa also [contract the disease](https://sti.bmj.com/content/early/2019/07/26/sextrans-2019-054080) once they arrive in [Europe](https://www.amren.com/tag/europe/).

What causes this? First, many Africans hold [outlandish theories](https://www.amren.com/tag/curious-customs-and-beliefs/) about the ways HIV/AIDS can be contracted, cured, or treated. One horrifying belief is that sex with a virgin will cure AIDS. The inevitable result is child rape.

[In 1998, *The Los Angeles Times* reported](https://www.amren.com/news/1998/11/o-tempora-o-mores-november-1998/):

&gt;This belief has lead \[sic\] to an epidemic of child rape. “It is hard to find a virgin of 16 nowadays, so men are turning to babies under 10,” says Mamelato Leopeng, an AIDS worker from South Africa.  
Because one in four adult males are infected with HIV in some parts of Africa, they are infecting large numbers of young girls. In Zambia, the rate of HIV infection among teenage girls is five to seven times the rate for boys — largely the result of forcible sex with older men. Although a great many rapes in Africa go unreported, in Zimbabwe the number reported increased 30 percent in the last five years. In 1997, more than half of the victims were children, many younger than five. Some young girls are raped by their own fathers or relatives. Many women now report that they are afraid to leave their daughters alone with any man, no matter how close a relative.  
One Zimbabwe rapist who called himself “King AIDS” was recently sentenced to life in prison for knowingly infecting an eight-year-old. “We even have cases of children still in \[diapers\] being raped,” says Jacqueline Pratt, acting chief magistrate of the criminal courts in Harare, the capital city.  
Zorodzai Machekanyanga, who heads an AIDS group for women in Zimbabwe, says the problem is rooted in African culture. “The girl child has no value in African society; she is a thing to be used to make men’s lives better.” Women are also thought to be the source of sexually transmitted diseases. In Shona, the majority language in Zimbabwe, AIDS and syphilis are literally called “women’s diseases.”  
Although child rape has come under increasing scrutiny because it has become a conduit for AIDS, it is an old practice in Africa. Witch doctors have traditionally prescribed sex with a virgin as a powerful cure for a variety of diseases and personal problems.

I am working along with a team of professors who do research in the area of workplace diversity, equity, and inclusion and we're looking to interview people living with HIV/AIDS. Specifically, we are inviting individuals to share their stories and experiences (all interviews would be confidential and no identifying info would be presented). It is our hope that we can share these stories with the scientific and business community in order to make better workplace policies and reduce stigma.

Specifically, we are beginning a study focused on the working experiences of individuals who have been diagnosed with HIV and are looking for people to participate. We are looking for approximately 40 individuals who have received an HIV diagnosis, are currently or have recently been working, are at least 18 years of age, and speak English.  We are looking for a wide range of ages, genders, time since diagnosis (including those in the long term survivor community), and races/ethnicities. Participation in the study includes an interview that will be conducted via phone or video chatting that should take no more than two hours. Everyone who participates will receive a $30 Amazon gift card. If you are interested, please send an email to [nas22@pdx.edu](mailto:nas22@pdx.edu). Also, if you know anybody who might be interested please share and spread the word! Thanks for your help!

This is consistent with the **heterogeneity of the causative toxins**.

The above summary indicates that American and European AIDS epidemics exhibit the characteristics of diseases caused **by non-contagious, chemical or physical factors NOT viruses**.

**A F R I C A N  A I D S**  
*AFRICAN AIDS IN NUMBERS*

…My analysis is based on statistical numbers from the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva, the United Nations and the U.S. Agency for International Development &amp; the U.S. Census Bureau (USAID).

According to the WHO’s Weekly Epidemiological Records,  
the whole continent of Africa has generated between 1991 and 1999 a rather steady yield of 60,000 to 90,000 AIDS cases annually, on average about 75,000 (WHO’s Weekly Epidemiological Records since 1991).

Based on the last available data from South Africa, 8,976 cases were reported there between 1994 and 1996 by the WHO, corresponding to about 4,500 cases per year (WHO’s Weekly Epidemiological Records 1998 and 1995). The **WHO does not report how many of these cases are deaths**, how many survive with, and how many recover from AIDS.

However, it is **evident** **from the WHO data that the African AIDS** epidemic is not following the bell-shaped curve of an exponential rise and subsequent sharp drop with immunity, that are typical of infectious epidemics. Instead it **drags on like a nutritionally or environmentally caused disease** (*Seligmann et al., 1984*), that steadily affects, what appears to be only a very small percentage of the African population.

Given a current **African population of 616 million** (*United Nations Environment Programme, June 15, 2000)*, and an average of 75,000 African AIDS cases per year, it follows that only **0.012% of the African population** is annually suffering or dying from **AIDS**.

Likewise only 0.01% of the South African population was suffering from AIDS between 1994 and 1996, based on the 4,500 annual cases and a population of approximately 44 million *(US Agency for International Development, “HIV/AIDS in the developing World”, May 1999)*. This means that the new African AIDS epidemic only represents **a very small fraction of normal African mortality**.

Based on a current average life expectancy for Africa of about 50 years (US Agency for International Development, “HIV/AIDS in the developing World”, May 1999), the annual mortality of **616 million** people is 12.3 million. Thus even if we assume that all AIDS cases reported by the WHO are deaths, the African **AIDS** epidemic represents only **75,000** out of **12,300,000 deaths** per year, or **0.6% of all African mortality**. Thus African AIDS is certainly not one of the historical microbial epidemics described by Camus and Anderson (see above). Since no immunity has emerged in over a decade, the restriction of African AIDS to a relatively small fraction of the large reservoir of susceptible people indicates non-contagious risk factors that are limited to certain subsets of the African population.

In view of the very small share (0.6%) that the African AIDS epidemic seems to hold on Africa’s total mortality, the question arises whether the mortality **claimed for AIDS** is in fact **new mortality**, that can be distinguished from conventional mortality, or whether it is a minor fraction of **conventional mortality** **under a new name**.  
To answer these questions we must try to distinguish African AIDS diseases from conventional African diseases  
(i) clinically as well as  
(ii) statistically.

***THE LONG LIST OF AFRICAN AIDS DISEASES*** *CAN NOT BE CLINICALLY DISTINGUISHED FROM THEIR CONVENTIONAL COUNTERPARTS*

According to the **WHO’s Bangui definition of AIDS** (*Widy-Wirski et al., 1988; Fiala, 1998*) and the “Anonymous AIDS Notification” forms of the South African Department of Health, African AIDS is not a specific clinical disease, but a battery of previously known and thus totally unspecific diseases, for example:

weight loss over 10%,  
chronic diarrhea for more than a month,  
fever for more than a month,  
persistent cough,  
generalized pruritic dermatitis,  
recurrent herpes zoster (shingles),  
candidiasis oral and pharyngeal,  
chronic or persistent herpes,  
cryptococcal meningitis,  
Kaposi’s sarcoma”  
Since these diseases include the most common diseases in Africa and in much of the rest of the world, it is impossible to distinguish clinically African AIDS diseases from previously known, and concurrently diagnosed, conventional African diseases. Thus African AIDS is clinically unspecific, unlike microbial diseases, but just like some nutritionally and chemically caused diseases (see above).

*AFRICAN AIDS IS TOO SMALL TO BE DETECTED STATISTICALLY AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF NORMAL AFRICAN MORBIDITY, MORTALITY AND GROWTH RATES*

The **annual population growth rates of Africa** have been between **2.4 and 2.8% per year since 1960** based on the American Agency for International Development &amp; the U.S. Census Bureau’s “HIV/AIDS in the Developing World” (U.S. Agency for International Development &amp; U.S. Census Bureau, Feb. &amp; May 1999) and the United Nations’ “African population Database Documentation” (United Nations Environment Programme, June 15, 2000).

As a result of the **high African growth rates**, the population of the whole African continent has grown from 274 million in 1960, to 356 million in 1970, to 469 million in 1980, and to 616 million in 1990 (United Nations Environment Programme, June 15, 2000). By comparison the **annual growth rate of the US is only 1%** and that of **Europe is only 0.5%** (USAID, Feb. &amp; May 1999).

Because of the numerical discrepancy between the relatively high African growth rates (**2.4 to 2.8%)** and the small annual deficits of these growth rates to be expected from **AIDS mortality (0.6%)**, an African AIDS epidemic can not be identified or confirmed based on its effect on the high African growth rates. In view of this, and the complete overlap between the complex battery of diseases that define the AIDS epidemic and their conventional counterparts, it appears that the presumably new AIDS epidemic can be neither distinguished epidemiologically nor clinically from conventional African diseases and mortality.

To all of us who have been subjected to the American AIDS rhetoric, and indeed the rhetoric of our first meeting in Pretoria last May, about the “**catastrophic dimensions” of African AIDS (Washington Post, April 30, 2000**), the healthy African growth rates come as a big surprise. Take as an example of this rhetoric President Clinton’s recent designation of AIDS as a “threat to US national security … spurred by US intelligence reports that looked at the pandemic’s broadest consequences, … particularly Africa … \[and\] projected that a quarter of southern Africa’s population is likely to die of AIDS …” (Washington Post, April 30, 2000).

In view of this rhetoric, it would appear that neither President Clinton nor the “U.S. intelligence” are aware of information available to the American Agency for International Development &amp; the U.S. Census Bureau. Indeed the USAID &amp; Census Bureau seem to have noticed the discrepancy between the facts and the rhetoric and are trying to hide it – the possible reason why “the largest demographic impact of AIDS” is cautiously described either as just a relatively small reduction in “life expectancy” or in expected population growth (not loss!): “Differences in population size between the AIDS-adjusted and the non-adjusted scenarios are often substantial … By the year 2010 … South Africa will have 5.6 million fewer people …” than expected based on current growth rates (“HIV/AIDS in the Developing World”, U.S. Agency for International Development &amp; U.S. Census Bureau, May 1999). A “catastrophe” 10 years down the road – and a “threat to U.S. national Security” now!

The alarming tone of WHO’s joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, “AIDS epidemic update: December 1999” (UNAIDS December 1999), announcing that Africa had gained 23 million “living with HIV/AIDS”, because they are “estimated” carriers of antibodies against HIV, since the “early 80s” (WHO, Weekly Epidemiological Record 73, 373-380, 1998) is equally surprising in view of information available to the agency. Neither the WHO nor the United Nations point out that Africa had gained 147 million people during the same time in which the continent was said to suffer from a new AIDS epidemic. Likewise, South Africa has grown from 17 million to 37 million in 1990 (United Nations Environment Programme, June 15, 2000), and to 44 million now (“HIV/AIDS in the Developing World”, U.S. Agency for International Development &amp; U.S. Census Bureau, May 1999). In the last decade South Africa has also gained 4 million HIV-positive people (A. Kinghorn &amp; M. Steinberg, South African Department of Health, undated document probably from 1998, provided at the Pretoria meeting). Thus South Africa has gained 4 million HIV-positives during the same decade in which it grew by 7 million people.

Moreover, although the 23 million “estimated” HIV-antibody positives are said to be “living with HIV/AIDS” by the WHO, the agency does not offer any evidence for morbidity or mortality exceeding the modest numbers, ie. about 75,000 cases annually, reported by the it’s Weekly Epidemiological Records.

The agency’s estimates of HIV-positives are indeed just “estimates”, because according to the 1985-Bangui definition of African AIDS as well as to the current “Anonymous AIDS Notification” forms of the South African Department of Health – no HIV tests are required for an AIDS diagnosis (Widy-Wirski et al., 1988; Fiala, 1998).

In addition the WHO promotes the impression of a microbial AIDS epidemic, by reporting African AIDS cases cumulatively rather than annually (WHO’s Weekly Epidemiological Records since the beginning of the epidemic). This practice creates the deceptive impression of an ever growing, almost exponential epidemic, even if the annual incidence declines (Fiala, 1998).

It would follow that the estimated increases in African HIV antibody (!)-positives do not correlate with decreases in any African population. On the contrary, they correlate with unprecedented simultaneous increases in the country’s populations – hardly the “catastrophe” imagined by the Washington Post and propagated by the WHO and the American AIDS establishment. But this deceptive AIDS propaganda biases a scientific analysis of African AIDS by all those who are not aware of the facts...""

First of all I apologize if anything I say or ask comes off insensitive. I  know nothing about this subject, other then what was spoon-fed to me in the 80's, which was aids came from being gay, or from being a drug user. Now That I'm 45 I know that's bullshit. But that is it.

One of the workers my wife manages at her job, brought her mother to the park to live with her. She lost her house in the first big fires in California, was living in a squalor of a trailer in the middle of a field. Last week we got a call from the mother that she had to get out because another fire. So they went got her and brought her here. My wife and the daughter/worker spent a day cleaning up the rv it was hooorible conditions. The mother is 70 years old suuuper skinny. Apparently wasn't eating/ wont eat, only drinks coffee, from what I could tell she comes off super depressed. 

After getting here, the trailer set up and cleaned. her 6 dogs, 3 cats, and a hugely overweight potbelly pig, moved into her house, I sat and asked her daughter/worker why her mom was like this. Long story short... 1)Abusive, alcoholic, druggie husband, dies leaves her with house and a crapload of animals so she clings to animals 2)She gets addicted to drugs goes wild loses her property and a bunch of animals on wildfires. 3) goes into major depression gives up on life lives in an old rv in a middle of a field with left over animals, all her family are poor, and have their own problems.

Ok so that's fine family is here, now she's has a nice clean rv cool..shes still not eating. So im like ok well I drink proteins shake all day, here give this and try it see if shell drink it. She does! daughter/worker was like mom loved it! drank it all said it made her feel really full tho. Ok good! this proteins shake is super healthy has tons of good vitamins minerals antioxidants probiotics ect ect  ill make her one a day when I make mine and she can drink it and ill just bring me the cup home again.

Then I found out something. The 70 year old mother has aids. Now I'm not freaking out or anything but now I a little hesitant on handling the cups after she has drunk them. I'm sorry I know its probably stupid but I don't know figured I would ask instead of assume. So How would/ or am I already safe making her these shakes, receiving the empty but dirty or cleaned cups back? 

Again I apologize for my ignorance and insensitivity, I just want to help this lady get healthier, but at the same time I want to keep myself and my family safe. Thank you for any info/advice. This is a new experience to us."

My husband is 32 and has AIDS. I am 33 and have HIV. We have been diagnosed now about four years. Just wanted to share some updates and general info with those of you who might be wondering. I posted about his hip problems. He is going to have a total hip replacement soon. Due to some coronavirus coupled with bureaucratic bullshit, we have had hell getting him on Medicaid or disability, but we expect one of those to come through any day now. So the Triumeq he was on for two years caused his hip joints to completely fossilize. The are square where they used to be round. As you can imagine, it is incredibly painful for him to walk. He still refuses a wheelchair, and limps along as best he can. My heart breaks for him but here we are.

He is still throwing up every day, which we need to get under control before he has his surgeries. We have tried Reglan and Zofran for him but neither has worked. I think his doctor is about to try Phenergan next. Any suggestions y'all have this way would be amazing. He will have a very hard time throwing up daily when recovering from the surgeries and I imagine the pain will be excruciating. 

I am still dealing with daily nausea but the Zofran works better for me then it does for him. At least it prevents me from throwing up most of the time. All of my other health complaints are minor compared to his. My Genvoya makes me gain weight so I am fat now. He cannot keep weight on even with the Biktarvy and is way underweight. Any suggestions for weight gain ideas here for him would be great also.

Hope y'all are doing well and living your best lives. This disease sucks and I wish none of us had to deal with it. My love to each and every one of you!"

Back in 1984 I was a chemist in a major pharmaceutical company, so had journals like Science circulate past my desk.  I distinctly remember Vol. 224 (27 April, 1984), which featured this report:

&gt;"" Rectal insemination modifies immune responses in rabbits""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Abstract:  
&gt;  
&gt;""Weekly  deposition of pooled rabbit semen into the rectum in healthy male  rabbits resulted in the appearance of immune complexes and antibodies to  sperm and to peripheral blood lymphocyte antigens. It also led to a  decreased ability to mount a humoral immune response to T  lymphocyte-dependent antigens, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and sheep red  blood cells. These findings suggest that repeated rectal deposition of  semen may compromise some aspects of the immune system.""

Yes, you read that right.   These researchers deposited rabbit semen into the rectums of male rabbits and claim to have observed a compromise in the immune system.  I am not here to question their motivations or their results, but I shouldn't have to spell out to anyone that this was intended to directly model homosexual sex.  *Naughty, naughty!  Mustn't do.  Mother Nature will punish you.*  Never mind that homosexual sex has been ongoing for millennia, without resulting in any apparent compromise of the immune system.  Never mind that anal sex is likewise practiced between men and women without resulting in any apparent compromise of the immune system. 

The ironic part, from my personal standpoint, is that the following article was published a mere two weeks later, and therefore came across my desk at the same time:

""Detection, isolation, and continuous production of cytopathic retroviruses (HTLV-III) from patients with AIDS and pre-AIDS""

Vol. 224, Issue 4648, pp. 497-500  


Yep.  Same journal.  Original publication (AFAIK\*) of research isolating the AIDS virus, putting AIDS research on a solid scientific basis.

I feel this is a snippet of history that should be remembered.

\*(To be complete, I do not actually know that this same work wasn't first published in another journal.  *Science* tends to be a general-interest journal, so it might be it was first published in another, more targeted journal.  I didn't investigate.  Furthermore, there was another group researching the AIDS virus at the same time and for all I know they may have published first.  Again, I didn't investigate.)"

Hello,

I am looking for LGBTQIA+ community members who would be open to participating in a short interview for a UC Berkeley undergraduate media research project. The project will look at how media representations have influenced perceptions of social behavior among members of the LGBTQIA+ communities – with a particular focus on how public health communications during this time of COVID-19 has been affected by the legacy of the early years of the AIDS pandemic. I am seeking out perspectives from adults who came of age during the peak of the AIDS crisis to better understand how those experiences compare to or differ from today. However, this project covers a broad scope, and all participants are invited to share their experiences (with sex education in school, mass media, coming out stories, etc.). 

Each conversation will be about 30-40 minutes, conducted over Zoom, and recorded for transcription. **I am completely aware and understanding of the potentially sensitive information that may be involved, so confidentiality and privacy will be honored and respected.** As this is solely for a media research project for a student course, the content **will not** be used for publication or use beyond this class. 

I can provide a fully detailed description of the project, and the parameters of participation (consent form, info on confidentiality, voluntary option to withdraw at any time, terms of usage, etc.) upon request.

A little information about me: 

I am a gay, male, Media Studies undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley. 

I hope you will consider this interview/conversation. Please reach out to me anytime with questions.

Thank you and be safe,

It's taken incredible expertise, collaboration and dedication from all levels of society to track, understand, treat and prevent the illness. Although HIV/Aids hasn't been eradicated, the global response is in many respects a shining example of what can be achieved when countries and people work together.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DnhEg3WSWE&amp;t=1067s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DnhEg3WSWE&amp;t=1067s)

I want to find more information about some of the people who are in it, including the patients and medical staff. The reason I want to find more info is because I want to know what happened to AIDS patient who seems to be only a young teenager - his name or age is not given in the film, but he definitely looks to be no older than around 17 or 18 years old to me. I also want to know what about to  poor Raymond, who told the sad story of the nurse who wouldn't even hand him a glass of water due to the fact he was an AIDS patient. I also want to try to find the current whereabouts of or get more info about nurse Iris who was looking after the really young patient.

The video was produced by Medvideo, Ltd (I can't find any info on this company other than that they seem to have made a small handful of videos in the 1980s in New York City where they were seemingly based). It was directed by a person called Rafael Abramovitz. I can find no info on Abramovitz or locate him on any website. 

I've relatively recently graduated with a degree in journalism and wish to write a little story about Raymond and the young (teenage?) lad.  I also want to know what their outcomes were (contrary to popular belief, some people with HIV/AIDS made it out of the 1980s alive) and also want to write a little about that brave nurse Iris who was never afraid from the beginning of dealing with AIDS patients.

Can anyone suggest how I might go about learning more about the people in this video in-depth? A Google search of the video itself only turns up the YouTube link, I guess it is a rare video. Or maybe there is someone out there reading this who can provide more info on the people in this film? 

Also, at 17:10 in the video, what does the young lad say? Does he say something about his leg hurting when he hits the glass or something? I don't know if he has a speech impediment or something, but his speech isn't clear. 

Many thanks everyone x"
l0l69f,Trying to make sense of the early AIDS epidemic infections,https://www.reddit.com/r/hivaids/comments/l0l69f/trying_to_make_sense_of_the_early_aids_epidemic/,SnooDogs7354,1,2021-01-19 06:44:36,10,/r/hivaids/comments/l0l69f/trying_to_make_sense_of_the_early_aids_epidemic/,NaN,"It was not until 1981 that doctors in NYC and  San Francisco started to see patients becoming sick with what was soon to be called ""AIDS"". Actually,  while 1981 is the year that is always cited as the year it was discovered, that's actually wrong; 1981 was the year that the syndrome was recorded and published in the MMWR journal and when it became known to the wider world outside of the medical community.  But there were in actual fact a few cases of pneumocystis pneumonia and Kaposi's Sarcoma in gay men in the year 1980 and also one recorded case of an openly gay man in NYC in 1979 as being treated for Kaposi's Sarcoma. I haven't been able to find anything prior to 1979 in either NYC or San Francisco that specifically points to AIDS. 

Now if we are to say that HIV has a variable incubation period in different people - for some people it can be as short as 3 or 4 years but for others it can be as long as 5, 6 or even 7 years - or even as long as 10 years in many people  - then this means the people who started falling sick in 1980 and 81 would have been infected with HIV during the 1970s. An incubation period of 10 years for the man who I mentioned developed Kaposi's in 1979 would mean he was infected in 1969 ...a shorter incubation period would mean some time in early or mid 1970s I guess. And the people who started getting sick in 1980 and 1981 (which was a lot of people) would have been infected either in 1970 and 1971 or in the early to mid 1970s. 

Now what I'm struggling with is why there was not this outbreak in huge numbers of people all at once until 1980/81? It seems odd to me that so many should start falling sick all at once, all at the same time. If the virus has a variable incubation period, why did some people who would have been infected in say 1970 or 1971, not start to become sick in 1975 or 1976? Or perhaps even earlier, in 1973 or 1974? Why did we not start to see sporadic outbreaks of opportunistic infections throughout the decade of the 1970s, leading up to the 80s, if that makes any sense? Why did it all seem to happen all at once? Now, I could be wrong, but the fact that hundreds of men just started becoming sick all around the same kind of time frame, suggests to me that HIV was ""introduced"" into these men all around the same kind of time - and not at different times throughout the 1970s. Or it just so happens that everyone infected in 1970 and 1971 had the same incubation period of 10 years? Don't know if I'm making much sense, but hopefully someone out there knows what I'm trying to say and can explain it for me. Also, because so many started falling sick in around 1980/81, and we assume all or most of them were infected in or around 1970/71 - that suggests to me something happened in 1970/71 in the United States. I don't know what, but something introduced HIV into gay men in either 1970 or 1971 in large numbers. What? Why? How? What happened in about 1970 in the gay world ????

Also, if we assume an average incubation period of 10 years, then everyone infected at any point in the 1970s decade (1970 - 79) would have come down with opportunistic infections by 1989, and the people who were infected when HIV was known about but not fully understood (and before proper safer sex education became widespread) in the 1981-1984 period let's say....would have started becoming sick by 1994. So we would have expected a ""peak"" of people becoming sick with full-blown AIDS in the very late 1980s and early 1990s, and then could expect to see infections either falling or at the very least plateauing around 1994 and dropping some time after that (because after that initial early period of people getting sick and beginning to understand the virus from the early 80s onwards, more and more people would have started using condoms). But I don't believe we ever saw any decrease or plateau of infections.... I think they've only ever gone in one direction until very recent years with the introduction of both PEP and PrEP as preventative measures. 

Is any of my thinking correct here, in theory at least, or is my logic skewed?"

Until now in my life, I've never met anyone so preposterous and paranoid about being watched by intelligence agencies and big-pharma about his actions. All of this encouraged me to collect the information about the reality of HIV/AIDS that is already available online and put it into a single PDF file so you can share it as a single plain text textbook with people you know that are denialist themself. If this saves a single life or provokes someone to think twice about his life and the life of others I would be more than happy.

I do not mean at all to be insensitive, but I am genuinely curious why a guy in NYC in 2017 might have likely died from HIV-related causes. Or why Alexis might have died with her connections.

oc3lp7,40th Anniversary of the First Article Published about HIV/AIDS,https://www.reddit.com/r/hivaids/comments/oc3lp7/40th_anniversary_of_the_first_article_published/,LifeInPhilly,1,2021-07-01 22:28:19,5,/r/hivaids/comments/oc3lp7/40th_anniversary_of_the_first_article_published/,NaN,"40 YEARS LATER

I was 4 years old when the first article about HIV/AIDS was published by the NY Times, ""[A Rare Cancer Seen In 41 Homosexuals](https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/03/us/rare-cancer-seen-in-41-homosexuals.html)."" It was July 3, 1981. I grew up knowing that AIDS was a horrible way to die, that it left people with sores all over their bodies, that they would waste away and become unable to care for themselves. I knew that gay men were disowned by their families and left to die alone. 

AIDS was also hysterical, a winning punchline to every joke. Kids are terrible. Good christians are worse, the worst people I have ever known. They preached that gays were getting what they deserved, a punishment from god for their wickedness. From Jerry Falwell to that asshole from Duck's Dynasty, it is still happening. We've come a long way but it is still a scary world for most of the world's gay and trans people.

I was 5 years old when I realized that I was gay. I was watching Friday Night Videos on our 13"" black and white television in my mother's bedroom. Suddenly, my mother screamed at me to turn the television off. I lunged at the television, she continued shrieking until I turned the knob to off. I thought the electric cord had caught fire. But, nothing. ""What happened?"" My mother explained that two men in the video were holding hands in the back of a car. I had seen that. She said that they were evil, perverts, ""gay birds."" I was confused. I said that I didn't understand because I hold hands with Sean (my best friend) and that was okay. She said that it was different for adults. These men were gay. The word abomination is something every little christian kid learns early. And, even though my mom thought it was different for boys and men to hold hands, I knew I'd be holding hands with men when I grew up. I still clearly remember being 5 and staring at the green glow that hovered on the screen after it had been turned off. 

Around that same time, a man who I didn't know called our house. I answered the phone and he asked to talk to my mother. I didn't know what gay looked like and I definitely did not know what it sounded like, but I felt an immediate connection to this man based on his voice. There was something familiar and beautiful about it. That gay voice, the voice that most of the gay men of my generation learned to hate about ourselves and about each other. My mother told him not to call again and slammed the phone down before telling me that he was a guy who she grew up with and he was gay.

My gay tribe spent most of our adolescence trying to change everything about ourselves. This goes way beyond our desire to hold hands with other men and our voices. It's the way we walk, the activities we do, the clothes we wear, the music we listen to. I used to watch Tony Danza and practice the way he smiled and laughed. We study masculinity and machismo then turn it into performance art. We put on their expressions and postures and we tell jokes about faggots and AIDS. This becomes our ideal, the epitome of what we want to be and, because we cannot pray the gay away, who we want to sleep with. Some of us adopt an identity that allows us to escape ridicule. Others are tortured. I'd argue that most of us spend some time considering suicide. We absorb everything we were taught by the people who hate us.

I was a great student. A gay guy lived on my street who carried a purse and had frosted hair. I was repulsed by him while I worshiped the white trash straight guys who I spent most of my time getting high with. By the time I was graduating high school, I convinced myself that I was growing out those gay feelings. I had girlfriends and I barely jerked off thinking about my best friends. That summer, I went to a music festival. It was grunge and punk and metal. And, just as I was starting to believe that I'd have a wife and kids and a suburban house with a tire swing, I saw Brian Grillo. He was ... well he was everything. He was the lead singer of Extra Fancy, a band that felt like a cross between the B52's and the Buzzcocks. He wore tight cut-off jean shorts with combat boots, very 90's. His head was shaved. He was muscular and covered in sweat as he banged on a giant steel tub. He looked like a skinhead but he was singing about being gay and having AIDS. I did not know there were gay men like this. I started coming out the next day.

The night I came out, I was homeless. When kids come out and end up on the streets, they have to do whatever they can to survive. It has long been known that LGBTQ kids make up a disproportionate amount of the homeless youth. While about 5-10% of young people are thought to be gay and/or trans, they make up 20-40% of the young homeless population. And the average age they become homeless is approximately 13-14 years old. They aren't old enough to get a legal job. These adolescents are homeless because they are hated and they are my heroes. I think they are about to change the world.

The generation of influencers and kids who were never told *no* are about to become adults. And, I feel good about it. They are qeerer and outer and more accepting than any other generation. I welcome a generation that cannot fathom that when I was their age it was illegal for me to have sex with my partners or marry my partner. I welcome a generation that will not take no for an answer to their demands for justice and equality. I welcome a generation that does it all while taking selfies. I argue that they embody the spirit of the gay and trans people of the early 80's, the people who dared to leave everything behind to live in big cities and dance until dawn. They were brave and defiant and fabulous. Their TicTocs would have been amazing.

As we recognize the 40th anniversary of that first article about a rare cancer seen in 41 homosexuals, it is impossible to calculate the loss. We lost brilliant minds, artists, musicians, designers, organizers, demonstrators, lovers and friends. When I think about those first 41 gay men, I wonder where they would be tonight. I like to think they would be gathered in groups of old friends, sitting on barstools, laughing about old times and watching the next generations of gay and trans kids dancing in front of mirrors. I like to think they would be proud of those of us who followed them, working to support organizations that really did make some amazing progress on things I never imagined I would see in my lifetime. I hope they would think we've done enough, that I've done enough.

I’m a 42 yo woman, married for 13 years and me and my husband have a child.
I live in an European country and my husband is currently working quite far away from us.
4 months ago my husband found out he has full blown AIDS. He immediately called me and told me about his diagnosis and I went to get tested with our child immediately. I had a rapid test done and blood was also drawn from my vein (I got the results after a week) and my child had the rapid test done (the doctor assured me it was enough to get that kind of test since children are usually infected by their positive mothers). Both me and my child turned out to be negative.
Ofc my mind went straight to my husband having an affair at one point during our relationship since we both got tested at the very beginning of our relationship (14 years ago) and we were both negative back then. 

After some more testing his viral load turned out to be 150 000 and cd4 count 115. The virologist told him he was infected a long time ago.

My husband is adamant about never having cheated on me. He thinks he got it before we got tested, but was in a so called “window period” so the first test came back negative even though he was already infected. 

I’m not sure I believe him. Tbh, I doubt he’s telling me the truth since it turns out he lied to me anyway (when we got tested 14 years ago I told him about the window period and that it was important he didn’t have unprotected sex for 3 to 6 months before getting tested to have accurate results and he pretended he didn’t). 

The doctor who saw me and my child (when we went to get tested) told me it’s unlikely he got infected 14 years ago and that, since he has AIDS at this point, according to him (the doctor), my husband was infected 4 to 10 years ago.

My husband is doing fine physically, he’s on antiretroviral therapy, he has no side effects, but his life is still at risk since his cd4 count is low.

To say I’m shocked would be an understatement. 
I come from a country with an extremely low incidence of HIV. I’ve never met a positive person in my life up until now. I always dreaded AIDS and STD’s in general so I was the only one amongst people I know who actually got themselves and their bf tested for HIV before ditching condoms. I still remember the doctor, all surprised, asking me why I wanted us to get tested since HIV is such a rarity in our country and we both weren’t in the “risk group”. I so want to go back in time and punch that mf in the face. Now looking back it was as if I had a hunch.

Since my husband got diagnosed we haven’t seen each other in person (COVID restrictions plus his condition), but me and my child are going to go to his place for a vacation soon. I’m so afraid how my husband is going to deal with us being there (he’s very afraid that he might infect us accidentally) and I’m also afraid even though I’m rationally very well aware of the way HIV can and cannot be transmitted. 

I’m so lost and confused. My emotions are all over the place. I cannot tell anyone about what’s going on since my husband is afraid of anyone finding out. Tbh I’m afraid too. In my country the stigma is very strong. HIV positive people have difficulties finding a dentist, parents redraw children from school if they find out there’s a positive child there...even the family members of positive people are often shunned.
I love my husband, I fear for his life, I’m preoccupied about his mental state considering he’s all alone in another country, but I also doubt him, I’m angry because he was so reckless (he admitted to me 4 months ago he didn’t use protection with most of his previous gf) to put me and his child at risk. My feelings are so contradictory. Sometimes I wish I could just run away. But I cannot. I feel stuck. I feel both him and me are so disconnected from everyone since we’re pretending in front of everyone around us that everything is fine so we can talk about his diagnosis only to each other. 
He told me to leave him because I’ll never trust him anyway. He said he doesn’t want to risk infecting me or our child. He doesn’t want to have sex at all in the future. He said there’s no guarantee that he couldn’t infect me even if the chance is only theoretical. He’s preoccupied about my mental state (how I’ll cope with his diagnosis with my OCD...yep, to top it all I have OCD)
I feel so sad.
Is there anyone in my situation here?"

A little confused…. I asked my doctor how I was diagnosed with AIDS when I was infected (infected sounds bad, correct me if I’m wrong for using this word) in September of 2019…. And he gave me an answer but with all the thoughts in my head, it was all going in one ear and out the other ear. Anyways, before I ask him again to clarify…. I wanna ask y’all your thoughts. 

I was testing negative from HIV all through 2017, 18, and tested negative April of 2019…. I wasn’t really active till I met this guy in July. We were messing around unprotected, not knowing he was very sexually active…. I didn’t get tested till Feb of 2020 which I was testing positive for HIV. Went to the doctors a few days later after the positive test and began treatment. Test results showed my CD4’s were 178. AIDS diagnosis followed. 

I then became undetectable within one month as my next blood draw showed I was undetectable. That was March 2020.

I’ve been reading that most of the time or whatever, HIV left untreated turns to AIDS in roughly 10 years?? Rare cases within 2 years?

Am I going crazy? I should really press my doctor but I just haven’t really asked as I tried to put this diagnosis behind me. I only bring it up when I meet someone that may potentially lead into a sexual relationship. 

Thoughts? I’m still new to this HIV thing…. So forgive me if I sound uneducated. I read articles but…. It’s all words to me. I can’t grasp."

I had sex with a girl 2 weeks ago, I used a condom but I did perform unprotected oral sex on her. I just felt 2 enlarged lymph nodes in the posterior triangle of my neck, should I be concerned or am I overreacting?"
